exempted by the Board of Selectmen. Curbs shall be installed on the
first course of bituminous concrete before the installation of the second
course.
C. The width of the traveled portion of new residential subdivision roads
shall be 22 feet, provided that if the Board of Selectmen finds that traffic
projections for the proposed road or other factors affecting the safety of
travel upon the proposed road require a wider width, it may require that
the width of the traveled portion be wider, up to a maximum of 26 feet.
D. The width of the traveled portion of new business and industrial
subdivision roads shall be 26 feet.

§ 168-1. Statement of purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to help preserve Bethany's rural character
and beauty by enabling the town to preserve its scenic rural roads,
consistent with safe travel. Bethany's rural roads are an important part of
its history and an essential component of its rural character. They provide
recreational opportunities for those who travel along them, by whatever
means, enjoying the scenery along the way.
§ 168-2. Designation of scenic roads.
§ 166-17 BETHANY CODE § 168-2
1:100
A. Authority to designate scenic roads. The authority to designate a town
highway or any portion of any town highway in the Town of Bethany as a
scenic road is hereby delegated to the Planning and Zoning Commission
of the Town of Bethany, to be exercised pursuant to the designation
criteria and according to the procedures set forth herein. (Hereinafter,
the word "road" shall be used to mean any public highway in the Town of
Bethany. This term does not include state highways or private roads or
private rights-of-way.)
B. Designation criteria.
(1) No portion of a road shall be designated as a scenic road if the
abutting property is located in a Business and Industrial Zone on
either side of that portion of the road at the time that the application
for designation is filed hereunder.
(2) No road or portion of road shall be designated as a scenic road if
the Commission finds, based on the evidence in the record before it,
that:
(a) The road serves as a primary artery for traffic as an east-west
route or as a north-south route, that a state highway is not a
reasonable alternative and that alterations or improvements, as
defined herein, must be made in the road to safely accommodate
existing or reasonably and proximately anticipated traffic; or
(b) The road carries intensive vehicular traffic, such that a high level
of traffic congestion results in unreasonable delays for vehicular
traffic.
(3) If only a portion of a road is to be designated as a scenic road, that
portion must extend from the intersection with a different road to the
intersection with another road, or to the end of the road or to a town
boundary line. If a road is partially in a Business and Industrial Zone,
the portion of the road to be designated may begin at the termination
of the Business and Industrial Zone and end at an intersection with
another road, the end of the road or a town boundary line.
(4) If the conditions of § 168-2B(1), (2) and (3) of this chapter are met,
and the approval of the owners of a majority of lot frontage has been
established as set forth in § 168-2C of this chapter, the Commission
shall designate the road or portion of road a scenic road, if it finds
that the road or portion of road has two or more of the following
characteristics:
(a) It is unpaved;
(b) It is bordered by mature trees or stone walls;
(c) The traveled portion is no more than 20 feet in width;
(d) It offers scenic views;
(e) It blends naturally into the surrounding terrain;
(f) It parallels or crosses over brooks, streams, lakes or ponds; or
(g) It abuts land on which significant historic structures or notable
geologic or other natural features are located.
(5) Any such designation shall specify how the road qualifies under each
of the scenic criteria, set forth in § 168-2B(4) of this chapter.
C. Procedure for scenic road designation.

done in a manner to restore the road, to the extent possible, to its scenic
character at the time of the emergency.
E. Alterations to scenic road to correct potential hazards to safety.
(1) When the Board of Selectmen finds that a potential hazard to the
safety of the traveling public may exist on a scenic road, it shall
publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in Bethany
and shall, at the same time, provide a copy of said notice to the

traffic, such that a high level of traffic congestion results in
unreasonable delays for vehicular traffic, including emergency
vehicles, or in the event that the physical condition of the scenic
road deteriorates, such that the town cannot maintain it in good
and sufficient repair and in passable condition without alteration
or improvement, alteration or improvement may be permitted, in
§ 168-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-4
1:105
accordance with the standards and procedures set forth herein. Any
such alteration or improvement shall be planned and implemented
so as to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, the scenic
characteristics of the road, as set forth in its designation. No
unpaved scenic road shall be paved unless a valid application has
been filed in accordance with § 168-4H of this chapter.
(2) If the Board of Selectmen determines that alterations or
improvements in the scenic road may be necessary, it shall establish
a committee, as set forth in § 168-4F(3) of this chapter, to advise it
as to appropriate alterations and improvements to be made in said
scenic road and/or as to appropriate alternatives to alteration or
improvement, according to the guidelines set forth in § 168-4F(4) of
this chapter.
(3) The Committee shall consist of two representatives of existing
landowners along the scenic road, as chosen by the landowners upon
notification, in writing, to all such landowners of the establishment
of said committee by the Board of Selectmen, provided that if the
landowners do not choose representatives within 30 days of such
notification, the Board of Selectmen shall choose the
representatives; the Town Road Foreman; and one representative
each from the Bethany Volunteer Fire Department, the Conservation
Commission and the Planning and Zoning Commission, to be chosen
by the respective department or commission. The representative
of the Conservation Commission shall chair the Committee. The
Committee shall comply with all applicable legal requirements,
including the requirements of Sections 1-18a through 1-211 of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
(4) The Committee shall report its recommendations to the Board of
Selectmen in writing.
(a) The recommendations shall maintain, to the maximum extent
possible, the characteristics of the scenic road as identified in its
designation, including but not limited to the width of the scenic
road, curves and grades, stone walls, mature trees, bushes,
rock formations and other notable natural and historic features
adjacent to the traveled portion of the road, or which can be
seen from the road, and the absence of paving in the case of an
unpaved road.
(b) The recommendations shall recognize that scenic roads conform
to the topography of the land, are often narrow, uncurbed and
flanked closely by forest or field and that unpaved roads are
especially deserving of preservation as reminders of Bethany's
past.
(c) Consideration shall be given to the installation of guide posts
and guide rails and the use of reflectors, warning, speed limit
and other signs as alternatives to alteration or improvement.
Materials that blend into or complement the scenic
characteristics of the scenic road, including but not limited to
stone and timber, shall be used for bridges, guide rails, guide
§ 168-4 BETHANY CODE § 168-4

posts and other engineered structures. Curbing shall be used
only as necessary for proper lawful drainage.
(5) Upon receipt of the Committee's report, the Board of Selectmen
shall make the report available to the public at the office of the
Town Clerk and schedule a meeting to discuss and hear comment
on the recommendations. The meeting shall be scheduled no sooner
than 15 days after notice of the meeting has been published in a
newspaper of general circulation in Bethany, which notice shall state
the purpose of the meeting. The report shall be made available to
the public at the Town Clerk's office no later than the date on which
said notice is published.
G. Connection of new road to scenic road. Whenever the Board of
Selectmen reviews a proposal pursuant to its road specifications for a
new road, such as a subdivision road, its recommendation shall include
consideration of the following:
(1) Alternative locations for the connection of a new road to a scenic
road, in order to select a location that would have the least potential
detrimental impact on the scenic road.
(2) Alternative routes for the new road that could connect the new
road to other existing roads, in order to minimize or eliminate any
potential detrimental impact on one or more scenic roads.
H. Paving of unpaved road. Upon the filing of an application with the Town
Clerk, signed by the owners of a majority of lot frontage abutting an
unpaved scenic road and indicating that they want the traveled portion
of the unpaved road to be paved, the Town Clerk shall forward such
application to the Board of Selectmen, and the Board of Selectmen may
cause the traveled portion of the scenic road to be paved, provided
that the Town Clerk has certified to the Board of Selectmen that the
application is signed by owners of a majority of lot frontage along the
designated scenic road.
§ 168-5. No restriction on use of adjoining property.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit a person owning or
occupying land abutting a scenic road from maintaining and repairing the
land which abuts the scenic road if the maintenance or repair occurs on
land not within the right-of-way, paved or unpaved, of the scenic road.
§ 168-6. Statutory compliance.
Nothing herein shall relieve the town from complying with Section 8-24 of
the Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 168-7. Severability.
If any portion of this chapter is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or unenforceable in any respect, that
portion shall be deemed severed from this chapter, and the remainder of
this chapter shall be unaffected thereby.

with all applicable safety requirements.
H. Proof of compliance with any bond or other financial security required
by this chapter.
I. Payment of the licensing fee.
§ 176-10. Vehicle and container registration.
Each licensed refuse collector shall obtain a separate registration for each
vehicle he operates within this municipality. When a vehicle is employed
to transport more than one container, each container to be transported,
instead of the vehicle, shall require a registration. Registrations shall not
be transferable from vehicle to vehicle nor container to container; provided,
however, that the Director may allow such temporary transfer of
registrations in hardship situations, such as a temporary breakdown of an
individually registered vehicle.
§ 176-11. Registration term; renewal; fee.
All registrations shall be issued for a term not to exceed one year and shall
be renewable on or before the first day of July of each year. The registration
fee shall be as determined by the Board of Selectmen pursuant to § 176-4 of
this chapter.
§ 176-12. Reinspection of vehicle upon sale or transfer.
Whenever a duly registered vehicle is sold or transferred to another refuse
collector licensed in this municipality during the registration year, said

§ 176-15. Notification of sale or transfer of route.
When any licensee shall sell or transfer all or part of his route to another

and the intended date of sale.

transferee shall, at the same time, make application for a license to operate
in this municipality.
§ 176-17. Furnishing of routes serviced.

collector must, during the month of June, furnish to the Director the
geographical routes within this municipality that such refuse collector
services or intends to service.
§ 176-18. Cash bond required.
All applicants for a license shall file with the Director a cash bond in
an amount equal to the estimate of the tonnage of waste expected to be
disposed of for a two-month period. If during the term of the license,
the monthly tonnage deposited by a collector at the Bridgeport System is
greater than the amount estimated, the Director may require the cash bond
to be increased to reflect the actual tonnage disposed of.
§ 176-19. List of rates.
Each collector shall furnish to his customers, upon request, a list of rates
for the various services he provides.
§ 176-20. Revocation or suspension of license or registration.
A. Generally. A license to engage in refuse collection and to use a transfer
station, a landfill or the Bridgeport System, if applicable, or other refuse
facilities provided by this municipality is a privilege, not a right. Failure
to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be grounds for
revocation or suspension of any license or registration issued under the
provisions of this chapter in addition to any other penalty imposable by
law.
B. Notice required. Revocation or suspensions shall only become effective
five calendar days after receipt of written notice from the Director.
C. Request for review; filing; effect of failure to file. If a refuse collector
objects to the Director's action described in Subsection B above to
revoke or suspend his license or registration, he may, within the five
calendar days of receipt of said notice, file a written request for review
with the First Selectman. Failure to timely file such request for review
shall make the Director's actions final and binding upon the collector.
D. Effect of timely filing. Timely filing of such request for review shall
operate as an automatic stay of the Director's action.
E. Special Appeals Board; hearing. The First Selectman shall appoint
forthwith a Special Appeals Board consisting of two electors of this
municipality, the Second and Third Selectman and a member of the
§ 176-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-20
1:121
Board of Finance. Said Board shall then, within 15 days, hear and decide
the matter. Such hearing shall be private; except, however, that such
hearing may be public if so requested, in writing, by the refuse collector.
The decision of said board shall be final and binding upon the collector.
F. Names, addresses of customers to be furnished upon revocation or
suspension. Whenever a collector's license or registration is revoked or
suspended, he shall furnish the Director, within 24 hours, the names and
addresses of his customers.
G. Refusal of permission to use transfer station. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Director shall have power to refuse
permission to a collector to use a transfer station, if applicable, or
the Bridgeport System or OBW landfill or any other waste facility of
the municipality when, in his opinion, such collector has violated this
chapter or any other applicable rule or regulation.

Each refuse collector shall deliver all processible solid waste collected
within the territorial limits of this municipality to the Bridgeport System
or to a transfer station, if applicable, and pay the disposal charge to this
municipality. All other refuse shall be delivered to such place as the Director
may from time to time designate, and any applicable charge shall be paid
by the refuse collector as may be determined by the Director.
§ 176-22. Failure to pay fees and charges.
Any refuse collector failing to pay to this municipality any fees or charges

the charge shown on such bill, interest on such charge at the rate of one
and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month or fraction thereof commencing
on the date of such bill, plus all costs of collection, including reasonable
attorney fees, incurred by this municipality in collecting said bill. A failure
to pay shall also be grounds for revocation or suspension of a license and
registration and shall further be grounds for withdrawal of the cash bond
filed with the Director.
§ 176-23. Restrictions on delivery of processible solid waste.
No licensee shall deliver any processible solid waste to any place other
than the Bridgeport System unless it is incapable of accepting processible

delivered to the place designated by the Director.
§ 176-24. Construction and maintenance of vehicles and containers.
All vehicles registered to collect and transport refuse shall be of a
watertight construction and shall be maintained free of obnoxious odors
and accumulated refuse. Any such vehicle with a capacity in excess of 10
cubic yards shall be of a closed construction. A container utilized primarily
for nonliquid refuse need not be of watertight construction, but shall be
completely enclosed. If any such vehicle shall have a capacity of less than
10 cubic yards, it may have an open top, provided that it is covered when it
is in motion, to prevent the escape of refuse.
§ 176-25. Delinquent customers.
A refuse collector may refuse to provide collection service to any customer
who is more than 30 days delinquent in the payment of the refuse collector's
fee. If the delinquent customer shall discharge his delinquency, the refuse
collector shall immediately restore collection services to the customer.
§ 176-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-26
1:123
§ 176-26. Responsibility to provide service; refusal to provide.
Refuse collectors are hereby made jointly responsible for providing
collection service to any resident of this municipality. If any resident of
this municipality shall be refused collection services or is dissatisfied with
collection service for cause, he may make application to the Director, who
shall have the right to direct said collector to provide service or who shall
have the right to designate another licensed refuse collector to provide
refuse collection service, and the collector so selected shall comply with
the Director's designation. In making such designation, the Director shall
give primary consideration to those collectors who service customers in the
same or contiguous locality.
§ 176-27. Designation of collector to provide service.
In the event that refuse collection service is not provided, the Director
shall designate a licensed refuse collector or collectors to provide refuse
collection service in the geographical area affected, and such collector or
collectors shall comply with the Director's designation.
§ 176-28. Customer's containers.
Refuse collectors shall leave their customers' containers in a neat, upright
position with lids replaced and off the road.
§ 176-29. Spilled refuse.
Refuse collectors shall clean up refuse that may have spilled when carrying
or transferring refuse.

ARTICLE IV
Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 176-30. Promulgation of regulations by Director.
The Director may promulgate additional rules or regulations on all
collection and disposal procedures from time to time as he deems proper,

Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Bethany.

“Vernal pools” are temporary pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals. They are considered to be a distinctive type of wetland usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and inspect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. During most years, a vernal pool basin will experience
-8-
inundation from local surface runoff. Inundation of the vernal pool only lasts a short time, then becomes dry until the following season. They are called vernal pools because they are often, but not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring (“vernal” meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). Despite being dry at times, once filled, vernal pools teem with life. The most obvious inhabitants are various species of frogs and toads.

b. the applicant’s purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would

-17-
foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and
f. impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the Commission that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Commission finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the Commission shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Commission shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands and watercourses” includes aquatic, plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) “habitats” means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands commission shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Commission shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Commission in its decision.
10.8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to subsection 7.11c of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide proof to the inland wetlands Commission that granting of the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction. Upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction, the inland wetlands Commission shall not grant the permit approval.
10.9 In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations, (1) the party holding the conservation or preservation restriction, other than a state agency that holds such restriction, may, not later than fifteen days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands Commission, subject to the rules and regulations of such Commission relating to
-18-
appeals. The inland wetlands Commission shall reverse the permit approval upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction; or (2) the state agency that holds such restriction may, not later than thirty days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands commission, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall immediately reverse such permit approval if the commissioner of the state agency that holds such restriction certifies that the land use authorized in such permit violates the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
10.10 Nothing in subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations shall be construed to prohibit the filing of a permit application or to require such written notice when the activity that is the subject of such permit application will occur on a portion of property that is not restricted under the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.

Requests for such approval shall be made on a form provided by the Commission and shall contain the information listed under Section 7.5 of these regulations and any other information the Commission may reasonably require. Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing applications prescribed in Sections 8, 9 and 11 of these regulations, such agent may approve or extend such an activity at any time.
12.2 Any person receiving such approval from such agent shall, within ten days of the date of such approval, publish, at the applicant’s expense, notice of the approval in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town wherein the activity is located or will have an effect.

WETLANDS AND WATERCOURSES
SECTIONS 22A-36 THROUGH 22A-45
INLAND WETLANDS AND WATERCOURSES ACT
Sec. 22a-36. Inland wetlands and watercourses. Legislative finding. The inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have
-34-
despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.

Each municipality, acting through its legislative body, may authorize any board or commission, as may be by law authorized to act, or may establish a new board or commission to promulgate such regulations, in conformity with the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-39, as are necessary to protect the wetlands and watercourses within its territorial limits. The ordinance establishing the new board or commission shall determine the number of members and alternate members, the length of their terms, the method of selection and removal and the manner for filling vacancies in the new board or commission. No member or alternate member of such board or commission shall participate in the hearing or decision of such board or commission of which he is a member upon any matter in which he is directly or indirectly interested in a personal or financial sense. In the event of such disqualification, such fact shall be entered on the records of such board or commission and replacement shall be made from alternate members of an alternate to act as a member of such commission in the hearing and determination of the particular matter or matters in which the disqualification arose. For the purposes of this section, the board or commission authorized by the municipality or district, as the case may be, shall serve as the sole agent for the licensing of regulated activities.
(d) At least one member of the inland wetlands Commission or staff of the Commission shall be a person who has completed the comprehensive training program developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-39. Failure to have a member of the Commission or staff with training shall not affect the validity of any action of the Commission. The commissioner shall annually make such program available to one person from each town without cost to that person or the town. Each inland wetlands Commission shall hold a meeting at least once annually at which information is presented to the members of the Commission which summarizes the provisions of the training program. The commissioner shall develop such information in consultation with interested persons affected by the regulation of inland wetlands and shall provide for distribution of video presentations and related written materials which convey such information to inland wetlands agencies. In addition to such materials, the commissioner, in consultation with such persons, shall prepare materials which provide guidance to municipalities in carrying out the provisions of subsection (f) of section 22a-42a.
(e) Any municipality, pursuant to ordinance, may act through the board or commission authorized in subsection (c) of this section to join with any other municipalities in the formation of a district for the regulation of activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses within such district. Any city or borough may delegate its authority to regulate inland wetlands under this section to the town in which it is located.
(f) Municipal or district ordinances or regulations may embody any regulations promulgated hereunder, in whole or in part, or may consist of other ordinances or regulations in conformity

(g) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the existing authority of a municipality or any boards or commissions of the municipality, provided the commissioner shall retain authority to act on any application filed with said commissioner prior to the establishment or designation of an inland wetlands Commission by a municipality.
Sec. 22a-42a. Establishment of boundaries by regulation. Adoption of regulations. Permits. Filing fee. (a) The inland wetlands agencies authorized in section 22a-42 shall through regulation provide for (1) the manner in which the boundaries of inland wetland and watercourse areas in their respective municipalities shall be established and amended or changed, (2) the form for an application to conduct regulated activities, (3) notice and publication requirements, (4) criteria and procedures for the review of applications and (5) administration and enforcement.
(b) No regulations of an inland wetlands Commission including boundaries of inland wetland and watercourse areas shall become effective or be established until after a public hearing in relation thereto is held by the inland wetlands Commission. Any such hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. A copy of such proposed regulation or boundary shall be filed in the office of the town, city or borough clerk as the case may be, in such municipality, for public inspection at least ten days before such hearing, and may be published in full in such paper. A copy of the notice and the proposed regulations or amendments thereto, except determinations of boundaries, shall be provided to the commissioner at least thirty-five days before such hearing. Such regulations and inland wetland and watercourse boundaries may be from time to time amended, changed or repealed, by majority vote of the inland wetlands Commission, after a public hearing in relation thereto is held by the inland wetlands Commission, in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. Regulations or boundaries or changes therein shall become effective at such time as is fixed by the inland wetlands Commission, provided a copy of such regulation, boundary or change shall be filed in the office of the town, city or borough clerk, as the case may be. Whenever an inland wetlands Commission makes a change in regulations or boundaries it shall state upon its records the reason why the change was made and shall provide a copy of such regulation, boundary or change to the Commissioner of Environmental Protection no later than ten days after its adoption provided failure to submit such regulation, boundary or change shall not impair the validity of such regulation, boundary or change. All petitions submitted in writing and in a form prescribed by the inland wetlands Commission, requesting a change in the regulations or the boundaries of an inland wetland and watercourse area shall be considered at a public hearing held in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. The failure of the inland wetlands Commission to act within any time period specified in this subsection, or any extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of the petition.
(c) (1) On and after the effective date of the municipal regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, no regulated activity shall be conducted upon any inland wetland or watercourse without a permit. Any person proposing to conduct or cause to be conducted a regulated activity upon an inland wetland or watercourse shall file an application with the inland wetlands Commission of the town or towns wherein the wetland or watercourse in question is
-42-
located. The application shall be in such form and contain such information as the inland wetlands Commission may prescribe. The date of receipt of an application shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of section 8-7d. The inland wetlands Commission shall not hold a public hearing on such application unless the inland wetlands Commission determines that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons who are eighteen years of age or older and who reside in the municipality in which the regulated activity is proposed, requesting a hearing is filed with the Commission not later than fourteen days after the date of receipt of such application, or the Commission finds that a public hearing regarding such application would be in the public interest. An inland wetlands Commission may issue a permit without a public hearing provided no petition provided for in this subsection is filed with the Commission on or before the fourteenth day after the date of receipt of the application. Such hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 8-7d. If the inland wetlands Commission, or its agent, fails to act on any application within thirty-five days after the completion of a public hearing or in the absence of a public hearing within sixty-five days from the date of receipt of the application, or within any extension of any such period as provided in section 8-7d, the applicant may file such application with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection who shall review and act on such application in accordance with this section. Any costs incurred by the commissioner in reviewing such application for such inland wetlands Commission shall be paid by the municipality that established or authorized the Commission. Any fees that would have been paid to such municipality if such application had not been filed with the commissioner shall be paid to the state. The failure of the inland wetlands Commission or the commissioner to act within any time period specified in this subsection, or any extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of the application.
(2) An inland wetlands Commission may delegate to its duly authorized agent the authority to approve or extend an activity that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when such agent finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater than a minimal impact on any wetland or watercourse provided such agent has completed the comprehensive training program developed by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-39. Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing applications prescribed in subdivision (1) of this subsection, such agent may approve or extend such an activity at any time. Any person receiving such approval from such agent shall, within ten days of the date of such approval, publish, at the applicant's expense, notice of the approval in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town wherein the activity is located or will have an effect. Any person may appeal such decision of such agent to the inland wetlands Commission within fifteen days after the publication date of the notice and the inland wetlands Commission shall consider such appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting provided such meeting is no earlier than three business days after receipt by such Commission or its agent of such appeal. The inland wetlands Commission shall, at its discretion, sustain, alter or reject the decision of its agent or require an application for a permit in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section.
(d) (1) In granting, denying or limiting any permit for a regulated activity the inland wetlands Commission, or its agent, shall consider the factors set forth in section 22a-41, and such Commission, or its agent, shall state upon the record the reason for its decision. In granting a permit the inland wetlands Commission, or its agent, may grant the application as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the regulated activity which are
-43-
designed to carry out the policy of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive. Such terms may include any reasonable measures which would mitigate the impacts of the regulated activity and which would (A) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (B) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (C) in the following order of priority: Restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources.

general welfare of the public.
g. The operation must be carried out in confonnity with the project plan as approved
and within the limits shown thereon and there shall be an undisturbed buffer zone of
one hundred (100) feet minimum from any property line or public road. The
Co111111ission may require additional buffer areas depending upon the effectiveness of
other controls and conditions in reducing impacts upon surrounding premises. The
Co111111ission may change or eliminate the requirement of a 100 foot buffer if it finds
that the operation will not have an adverse impact on adjoining parcels.
h. The Co111111ission, in its sole discretion, may allow screening or sifting of material
generated on site if the Co111111ission finds the screening or sifting will be for a sh01i
period of time and will not create an undue negative impact on smTounding

and its location on the site. All machinery for screening or sifting used in conjunction
with the operation shall be set a minimum of two hundred (200) feet from all property
lines. The short term temporary use of machinery for the crushing of boulders
generated on the site from the operation may be allowed at the discretion of the
Co111111ission ifthe applicant can demonstrate that it is the most viable means of
disposing of such boulders and that the impact on the neighboring property owners
will be minimal. The Co111111ission may reduce the required buffer for Special
Exception Pennit operations which involve screening or sifting or crushing ifthe
Co111111ission finds the adjacent property is not being used for a residence or other use
(such as recreation, day care, office building) that might be adversely affected by
these operations.
i. No fixed or permanent machinery, building or structures related to the proposed
activity shall be erected or maintained on the land. If temporary structures are

the permit whichever is sooner.
J. When the operation is completed, or work has progressed sufficiently to where
reclamation is practicable, the area affected by the operation shall be graded or
terraced, in accordance with the plan approved by the Commission, so that banks and
slopes in disturbed areas shall be no steeper than 1 :3 (ve1iical to horizontal). Subsoil
shall be added as necessary to provide an appropriate base for the topsoil, so as to
facilitate vegetation growth. The subsoil will be scarified in order to provide a good
bond with the topsoil. Top soiling of the disturbed area shall be done in accordance
with the application and materials standards for top soiling as set forth in the Erosion
Sediment Control Handbook of the USDA/ SCS, (most recent edition as amended).

properties from noise, dust, vibration, rock fragments or other unsightly or dangerous
conditions. These proper measures may include but are not limited to; wetting of
access roads, screening, fencing, matting, soil stabilization, limiting stockpiling and
covering loaded trucks leaving the site. In addition the Commission shall require the
maximum retention of existing natural buffers, including trees and topography
wherever possible to achieve such protection.
m. Where the excavation or filling results in slopes steeper than one (1) foot vertical to
three (3) feet horizontal, or where the depth of fill is ten (10) feet or more, the
Commission or its agent may, in the interest of public safety, require a safety fence to
be erected, enclosing the fill or excavation.

improvements are not installed as required by the Commission or its agents, the
Commission is under no obligation to accept the work. The Commission may
declare the bond defaulted and take the necessary action to call the bond.
2. Maintenance Bonds:
When required by the Commission to assure proper maintenance of all site improvements
and strnctures, a maintenance bond in the amount of 10% of the cost of the site
improvements shall be submitted and filed with the Town. The bond shall be posted prior
to the issuance of any Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The applicant shall maintain all
site improvements within the time frame of the bond as established by the Commission.

own expense, repair all failures and defects including but not limited to, the construction,
drainage strnctures, appurtenances, bridges and other improvements as may occur during
such maintenance period. The applicant shall similarly repair all defects, settlements and
irregularities of the structures and appurtenances of drains, pipes, mains, conduits, curbs
and gutters, paved surfaces, landscaping or other defective improvements detected during
the maintenance period.
If the applicant fails to remedy any such defect within a reasonable time, the Town

approved by the Commission within the prescribed amount of time, shall cause the
approval to expire and become null and void. Should an application be declared null
and void, the Commission may recommend that any posted bond be declared defaulted
and take necessary action to call the bond so that the property is adequately stabilized
with permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures in place.

2010, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of Bethany, and any subsequent
revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since
mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more
restrictive until such time as a mop amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The
SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as
floodway on a FIRM. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided
on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on

but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation or drilling operations, located within a "Special Flood Hazard Area" may
be made only in accordance with the requirements of this regulation.
A. Other Restrictions. This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
easements or other laws, regulations or ordinances, and whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
B. Inte1JJretation. In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions shall be
considered as minimum requirements and shall be construed so as to preserve and maintain
the purposes and intent hereof.
C. Warning and Disclaimer. The degree of flood protection established by this regulation is
considered reasonable for Town-wide studies. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions,
and flood heights may increase as a result of man-made or natural causes. This regulation
- 91 -
Section 18
does not imply that land outside the "Special Flood Hazard Areas" will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the pait of the Town of

Section 18
18.5 Standards.
A. General. In Special Flood Hazard Areas, all development shall conform to all applicable
standards hereinafter specified.
I. Anchoring. All new construction and substanti al improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2. Construction Mate1ials and Methods. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage and
by using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
3. Utilities. All utility systems shall conform to the follo\ving:
a. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; and
b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from systems
info flood waters, streams watercourses or wetlands;
c. On-site sewage disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid long term impairment
to them or contamination from them dming flooding; and
d. Electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, air conditioning and all other service
facilities shall be designed and/ or located so as to prevent water from
enteting or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. No
underground fuel storage system shall be installed or replaced within a special
flood hazard area.
4. Building and Floor Location. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation
data has been provided, the following provisions shall apply and a registered
engineer or architect shall review and /or develop structural design specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods or construction
are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the requirements of
this section:
a. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at
least two (2) feet above the BFE level.
b. Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
conunercial, industrial or non-residential structure shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated at least two (2) feet above the BFE level.
5. Compensatory Storage and Equal Conveyance
a. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except
those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction
caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an
increase in footp1int to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening
and/or widening the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless
easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided
within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood
storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the
theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-
year flood elevation, which vvould be displaced by the proposed project. Such
- 96 -
Section 18
compensatory volume shall have an unrest1icted hydraulic connection to the same
waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if
approved by the municipality.
b. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally
influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the
community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial
improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited
unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer
demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses perf01med in
accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not
result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work
within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to
provide compensatory storage shall not be constrncted in such a way so as to
cause and increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
c. Aboveground Storage Tanks. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.)
which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above
the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with
tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill
pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for
infiltration of flood water.
d. Portion of Strncture in Flood Zone. If any portion of a structure lies within the
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire strncture is considered to be in the
SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood
zone. The strncture includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or
any other strncture attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend
into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire strncture to meet the
standards of the more restrictive zone.
e. Strnctures in Two Flood Zones. If a strncture lies within two or more flood zones,
the constrnction standards of the most restiictive zone apply to the entire strncture
(i.e. V zone is more restrictive than A zone; strncture must be built to the highest
BFE). The strncture includes any attached additions, garages, decks sunrooms or
any other structure attached to the main strncture. (Decks or porches that extend
into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the
requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
f No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water. New construction, substantial
improvement and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage
cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is
functionally dependent use or facility.
B. Specific Standards.
I. Floodways. Located within the special flood hazard areas are areas designated as
floodways on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map or as may be determined by
competent professional. Floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the potential
velocity of flood waters which cause erosion and may carry debris and projectiles. The
following additional standards are applicable to development in relation to floodways:
a. There shall be no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, repairs to substantially damaged structures and other developments
shall be permitted unless certification, with suppo11ing technical data, by a registered
- 97 -
Section 18
professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices, that
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels dming
occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with
the flow and be of an open design.
2. Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RV's). In all Special Flood Hazard
Areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly placed, undergoing
substantial improvement or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated
so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at two feet above the base flood elevation (BFE).
The manufactured hoine must also meet all the construction standards per Section 18.5
A. This includes SFHA's outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home as incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood.
a. All manufactured homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent foundation
which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so
that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring
may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors.
b. All manufactured homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods and
practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be
provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no
more than ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than six
(6) feet above ground level.
c. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site for
fewer than 18- consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use,
OR (iii) meet all the general standards of Section 18.5 A. and the elevation and
anchoring requirement of Section 18.5 B.2.a.,b.,c. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no pe1manently attached
additions.
3. Maintenance of Flood CaiTying Capacity. The flood carrying capacity of any
watercourse affected by any proposed new construction or substantial improvement,
shall be maintained and not be diminished by the proposed construction or
improvements.
4. Prohibition of Making Structures Non-Compliant. A structure already in compliance
with the provisions of this regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any
alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to the structure.

Open Space Characteristics:
Proposed Open Space shall be evaluated to determine its characteristics with
regard to the above stated desirable characteristics. Desirable open space shall be
proposed as follows:
a) The area dedicated to open space shall not consist of a greater percentage of
area classified as wetland, watercourse, 100 year floodplain or slopes in
excess of twenty five (25) percent than the parcel as a whole. For purposes of
this section slopes in excess of 25% shall:
• be measured prior to any earth disturbance; and
• be shown on a survey or plan which has been signed, sealed and certified
as accurate; and
• be shown where the rise of the land exceeds 10 feet over any 40 foot
horizontal run on the subject property.
b) The Commission shall require an open space set aside of 20% of the total of
all such tracts of land, but may, in its discretion, accept a greater set aside. In
determining the total open space to be required, the Commission shall
consider not only the tract or tracts to be subdivided or resubdivided
immediately but also any other adjacent tract owned, controlled or under
agreement to buy or optioned by the subdivider or by a corporation controlled
or owned by the subdivider.

applicant shall consult with the Bethany Conservation Commission and shall
provide the opinion and recommendation of the Conservation Commission to
the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to final action on the application.
d) Open space shall be so located as to add to or to preserve the visual amenities
of the vicinity by maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or
overlooking it from nearby properties. When open space is set aside for
recreational purposes, it shall be located so as to be suitable for the designated
recreational uses it is intended to serve. All open space and any proposed
improvements thereon shall be shown on the subdivision or resubdivision
plan.
e) In any case in which an existing trail system (including a rerouted trail
system) crosses land to be subdivided or resubdivided, the subdivider is
encouraged to preserve the trail system as it exists or reroute it to assure
continued public access. The area covered by any legally valid easement for
such a trail system, which adequately protects continued public access to the
trail system shall be considered part of the total open space set aside.
f) The Commission shall require one or more of the following mechanisms be
employed in meeting the open space requirement:
1. Transfer in fee of the open space land to the Town of Bethany.
2. Transfer in fee of the open space land to a private land trust.
3. Transfer in fee of land to the State of Connecticut as State Park and forest
land.
4. Transfer in fee of the open space land to a known conservation
organization.

percent of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided
prior to the approval of the subdivision.
(b) The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser
jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant. The
fee of the appraiser shall be paid by the applicant.
( c) A fraction of such payment, the numerator of which is one
and the denominator of which is the number of approved
lots in the subdivision shall be made at the time of the sale
of each approved lot in the subdivision and placed in a
fund. Such fund shall be used solely for the purpose of
preserving open space and the capital improvement of
existing open space, including the acquisition ofland for
open space or for recreational purposes.
(d) When fees are provided in lieu of open space, the developer
shall execute a consensual lien which shall be recorded on
the Bethany land records. Partial releases shall be provided
upon the tender of each fractional payment.
The Commission may establish such standards, limitations and conditions
on use of any of the above mechanisms as it deems reasonably necessary
to assure the proper maintenance, operation and preservation of open
space, and where appropriate, public access.
g) Any land to be set aside as open space shall be left in its existing natural state
by the subdivider, and shall not be graded, cleared or improved, except as
specifically approved by the Commission, and shall not be used at any time as
a repository for stumps, brush, earth, building materials, or debris. Land
specifically set aside for recreational purposes may be improved as may be
approved by the Commission.

proceeding with any work or the filing of the approved subdivision or resubdivision
plan, the subdivider shall review the scope of the road(s), public utilities and
services to be completed to fulfill the conditions of the subdivision or resubdivision
plan (herein after referred to collectively as improvements) with the Commission
who will review the subdivider's estimates of the cost of construction and will
determine the type and amount of the surety to be furnished by the subdivider to
guarantee the completion of the improvements. In computing the estimated cost of
the improvements the Commission will give due consideration to possible
escalation of costs during the surety period.
If upon inspection the Commission determines that the construction costs for the
improvements exceeds the estimate or the posted surety has experienced a reduction
in value, the Commission shall have the power to require additional surety. The
subdivider shall be responsible for overseeing the actual costs of improvements and
advising the Commission if costs for such construction shall be in excess of the
estimates.

Section 13 - Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations
13 .1 Preamble
The purpose of these regulations is to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation that
occurs as a result of the construction ofresidential, industrial and commercial
development. Accelerated soil erosion caused by land use changes necessitates
costly repairs to gullies, washed-out fills, roads and embankments. In addition,
erosion destroys the soil's capabilities to support vegetation. The resulting
sediment entering water bodies and wetlands is a major pollutant and reduces water
quality and supply. Aesthetic, recreational, and fish and wildlife habitat values are
also degraded. Sediment deposition clogs storm sewers and road ditches, reduces
channel capacities which can result in flooding, reduces water depth and volume,
may cause subsequent erosion and may damage adjoining properties. The expense
of sediment removal alone identifies prevention as the cost effective altemative.
Therefore, pursuant to Public Act 83-388 of the Connecticut Legislature, these
regulations are hereby promulgated.
13 .2 Definitions
a. Agricultural activities means the growing of food or floral crops for animal or
human consumption and/or the raising of animals or fowl.

unimproved real estate.
f. Disturbed area means an area where the ground cover is destroyed or removed,
leaving the land subject to accelerated erosion.
g. Erosion means the detachment and movement of soil or rock fragments by water,
wind, ice or gravity.
h. Grading means any excavating, grubbing, filling (including hydraulic fill) or
stockpiling of earth materials or any combination thereof, including the land in its
excavated or filled condition.
1. Inspection means the periodic review of sediment and erosion control measures
shown on the certified plan.
J. Regulations mean any regulations adopted by a municipality pursuant to sections
8.2, 8.13d and 8.25 of the General Statutes.
k. Sediment means solid material, either mineral or organic, that is in suspension, is
transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by erosion.
