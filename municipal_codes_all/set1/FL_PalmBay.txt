conflict, and all provisions of this subchapter not in conflict shall remain
in full force and effect.  Further, this subchapter shall not restrict or
replace cost recovery from funding sources available under state and federal

or maintain such a violation, to refuse to obey any provisions or regulations

to serve a valid municipal purpose and expense, and the appropriation of all
funds necessary for such payments, actions, and expenses is hereby authorized
in accordance with F.S. §§ 111.07 and 111.071.



   (A)   Definitions.  As used throughout this section, the following

   (B)   Legal representation.



      (1)   Whenever in the performance of or in connection with the
performance of official duties on behalf of the city, an official shall
hereafter be involved in any litigation, claim, charge, dispute, proceeding,
administrative hearing or investigation, whether under federal, state or
local law, and whether in a representative or personal capacity, with or
without the city as a co-party in the matter, the city, to the extent
authorized by state law, shall promptly preserve, protect, defend, aid and
assist such official, by reason of such official being or having been a city
official, even if he or she is no longer an official at the time the claims
are made against him or her.



      (2)   In order to provide the official with the defense and
assistance called for herein, the City Attorney shall appoint legal counsel
to appear in all disputes, proceedings, hearings, litigation and appellate
proceedings and conduct the same on behalf of such official, and the city
shall pay the cost for such legal counsel and all costs and expenses related
thereto.



   (C)   Indemnification.



      (1)   In addition to providing legal representation, the city,

claims, demands,  proceedings, damages, losses, charges, advances,
disbursements, payments, costs, including reasonable attorney fees, awards,
settlements, judgments, decrees and mandates paid, incurred by or imposed
upon such employee or official in all disputes, proceedings, investigations,

a city official even if he or she may no longer be an official at the time
the claims are brought, filed or made against him or her.



      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to be a
waiver of sovereign immunity or a waiver of any other defense or immunity to
a lawsuit by the city official.



   (D)   Conditions for indemnification and representation.  The duty
to defend or indemnify and save harmless as prescribed by this section shall
be conditioned upon the prompt cooperation by the official in his or her own
defense, which shall require the following actions of the official:



      (1)   In the case of a public officer or employee, filing a
written notice with the City Manager requesting indemnification, which notice
shall include all relevant documents, including all summons, writs,
judgments, complaints, notices and orders.  For an elected officer, filing a
written notice with the City Attorney requesting indemnification, and
providing along with the notice, those relevant documents listed herein.

furnishing such evidence or assistance as shall be needed and requested by
the City Attorney or appointed legal counsel.



      (3)   Granting the city full rights of subrogation and the
right to recover under any claims, offsets or counterclaims of the official
arising in connection with the controversy involved in this section;
provided, that if the official shall recover any sums, then the city shall
deduct all disbursements, costs and expenses of litigation, including
attorney's fees from any such recovery  and the remainder shall belong to
the protected official.



      (4)   Executing and delivering to the city and the appointed
legal counsel all assignments, papers and documents needed to carry out the
purposes of this section.



   (E)   Refusal of city to indemnify for good cause; repayment of
costs and litigation expenses to city.



      (1)   The city may, for good cause, refuse to proceed with the
indemnification, defense, or both.



      (2)   GOOD CAUSE shall be defined as follows:



         (a)   An act committed by the official in bad faith, or
with malicious purposes or constituting moral turpitude, or in a manner
exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human and civil rights, safety, or
property.



         (b)   A violation by the official of the conditions
listed in division (D) of this section.



         (c)   The subject matter of the complaint, allegation or
charge has no connection with performance of official duties.



         (d)   An award of punitive damages against the official.



         (e)   A flagrant, willful and intentional violation of a
city ordinance, or state or federal law by the official.



         (f)   In response to an indictment, information,
charges, allegations, or a complaint, where the official enters a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere, or where said official is found guilty of any
action in violation of local, state or federal laws, regardless of whether
adjudication is withheld.  This is not to be applied to pleas or convictions
with regard to non-criminal traffic violations, so long as such violation
does not involve intentional, wanton, willful, or reckless behavior.



      (3)   At the request of any member of the City Council, the
City Manager or the City Attorney, a "good cause" determination shall be made
by the Risk Management Committee at a hearing on any request for
representation or indemnification made by an official.  The official shall
be provided at least 20 days notice prior to the hearing.  The sole issue
before the Risk Management Committee shall be the obligation of the city to
indemnify or provide a defense for the official, and the merits of the claim
made against the official shall not be an issue, so that the defense of the
claim shall not be prejudiced.  At the hearing, the city and the official
may offer such witnesses or other evidence as is relevant to a
determination.  The Risk Management Committee may call its own witnesses or
any person that will help in the determination to be made.  Witnesses shall
give sworn testimony.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Risk Management
Committee shall make its findings of fact and conclusions on the evidence,
which shall be final and binding.



      (4)   If the Risk Management Committee finds that good cause
exists to refuse to provide the official with indemnification or defense, the
city may refuse to pay any judgment or decree previously or subsequently
entered against any official, and may refuse to proceed with the
indemnification or defense of a pending charge allegation or claim. 
Further, any attorney's fees, costs, or other expenses already paid by the
city, if any, on behalf of the official relating to the claims, allegation or
charges may be recovered by the city.  Should the official fail to repay
these fees, costs and expenses, the city may bring a civil action against the
official for recovery of such.



      (5)    When a charge, claim, indictment, or allegation is
brought against an elected officer by reason of such official being or having
been an elected officer, or the subject matter of which is in any way related
to the elected officer's official duties, prior to city representation or
reimbursement of expenses, the elected officer shall sign a contract with the
city which shall contain a requirement and legally binding agreement
providing for the repayment to the city, in full, of all costs, attorney's
fees or other expenses, incurred by the city in the defense of the elected
officers in the event of a final determination by an administrative judge or
commission, of final judgement, mandate or order by a state or federal court,
of guilt, bad faith, malicious purpose, an award of punitive damages, or the
flagrant, willful or intentional violation of a city ordinance, or state or
federal lawn by that elected officer.  The elected officer shall also be
responsible for repayment in full  in the event the elected officer pleads
guilty or no contest (nolo contendere) to any of the charges.  The elected
official shall be legally responsible for repayment of all expenses
regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.



   (F)   Application to former officials or to past occurrences for
conduct or acts performing in the scope of their official duties on behalf of
the city.



      (1)   The indemnification guaranteed in this section shall
exist during as well as after the term of office or employment for
liabilities, charges, expenses, losses, and costs incurred in connection with
duties performed during the term of office or employment.



      (2)   The legal representation guaranteed in this section
shall be provided during and after the term of office or employment for
claims, litigation, charges, disputes, proceedings, investigations, hearings,
trials and appeals which arose during, or in connection with, the term of
office or employment.



      (3)   Such protections provided for in this section, shall
similarly apply to any proceedings, dispute, charge, investigation, hearing,
claim, or litigation which may be ongoing as of the effective date of this
section if such arose in connection with the official's performance of duties
on behalf of the city.

non-negotiable Certificates of Deposit will be handled through detailed
written procedures. Any such safekeeping receipt or confirmation shall fully

governed by the ‘prudent person rule' which states:



   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances

purchasers or consumers in advance of collecting them from the purchaser or
consumer, then in that event, the seller shall report and pay over to the
City Finance Director on the 25th day of each calendar month all such taxes
billed to the purchasers and consumers during the preceding calendar month.

   (A)   It is the intent of the city to increase its local
communications services tax rate as provided in Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB
1878, by the 2001 Florida Legislature. Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878,
provides that notwithstanding any provision of Fla. Stat. Chapter 202, to the
contrary, any municipality that has a local communications services tax
conversion rate established under Fla. Stat. § 202.20, which is less than
the maximum rate established under Fla. Stat. § 202.19, may by ordinance
increase its rate up to the maximum rate established under Fla. Stat. §
202.19, with such increased rate to be effective October 1, 2001. For the
period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002, the
maximum rate established under Fla. Stat. § 202.19, is deemed to be the sum
of such maximum rate plus the difference between the conversion rates set
forth in Fla. Stat. § 202.20(1)(a) and (b). The municipality must notify the
Department of Revenue of such increased rate by certified mail postmarked on
or before July 16, 2001.



   (B)   It is the further intent of the city to increase its local
communications services tax rate effective October 1, 2002, as provided in

one-tenths percent (5.1%) for municipalities that choose not to levy permit
fees.

1, 2001.

tenths percent (5.4%) which is less than the maximum rate of five and five
tenths percent (5.5%) as determined under the provisions of Section 13,
Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878. The local communications services tax rate for the
city is increased to five and five tenths percent (5.5%) during the period
beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002. As provided in
Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878, this increased rate is to be effective
October 1, 2001.



   (B)   The local communications services tax conversion rate
established under Fla. Stat. § 202.20(1)(b), for the city is five percent
(5.0%) which is less than the maximum rate of five and one tenths percent
(5.1%) as established in Fla. Stat. § 202.19(2)(a). The local communications
services tax rate for the city is increased to five and one tenths percent
(5.1%). This increased rate is to be effective October 1, 2002.

   The city directs that notice of the increased local communications
services tax rate be provided to the Department of Revenue by certified mail
postmarked on or before July 16, 2001, as provided in Section 13, Enrolled
CS/CS/SB 1878.

§ 35.114 PROCEDURE FOR RATE ADJUSTMENT.



   If, for the periods ending December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002, June 30,
2002, or September 30, 2002, the revenues received by the city from the local
communications services tax adopted herein are less than the revenues
received from the replaced revenue sources, adjusted for growth, the city
may, by resolution, adjust the rate of the local communications services tax
upward to the extent necessary to generate the entire shortfall in revenues
within one (1) year after the rate adjustment and by an amount necessary to
generate the expected amount of revenue on an ongoing basis.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



§ 36.45  HOURS; CURFEW VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   Purpose.  The City Council has determined that it is
necessary, for the health, safety, welfare, peace and tranquility of the
citizens of the city to provide for times of operation of city parks, and the
City council has determined that it is necessary to establish times of
operation for its parks and to make it unlawful to be or remain in parks
located within the city before or after hours of operation.



   (B)   Hours.  Except for unusual and unforeseen emergencies, or for
city-authorized or city-sanctioned activities that extend beyond the
designated closing time, public parks located within the city limits shall be
open to the public every day of the year during the designated hours of 7:00
a.m. to 10:00 p.m. for parks that have lighting at night and 7:00 a.m. to
sunset for parks that do not have lighting at night.  The opening and
closing hours for each park shall be posted in conspicuous places around park
areas as hereinafter provided.



   (C)   Penalties.  It shall be unlawful for any person to be in any
public park located within the city limits unless it is either during its
posted hours of operation or during an exception as provided herein. 
Persons apprehended in a park located within the city limits before or after
the opening and closing hours set forth in division (B) above shall be guilty
of a second degree misdemeanor punishable as provided in Fla. Stat. §§
775.082 and 775.083.  The removal or absence of the sign posting the hours
of operation of parks will not be a defense for entering onto or remaining in
a public park during the hours the park is closed.



   (D)   Exceptions. 



      (1)   Excepted from the penalty provision of this section are
those persons who are in public parks during hours other than the opening and
closing hours set forth herein, but only when city-authorized or
city-sanctioned athletic events or activities are on-going and extend beyond
the posted closing hours.



      (2)   When city-authorized or city-sanctioned events or
activities extend beyond the posted closing hours, the activities or events
may continue until completion.  Thereafter, upon completion, all persons
must leave the park no later than one-half (½) hour before being subject to
the penalty provisions in division (C) above.



   (E)   Signs.  The signs that indicate the opening and closing hours
of the park shall be at least eighteen (18) inches by twenty (20) inches in
size and the opening and closing hours shall be stated thereon in letters and
numbers no less than one (1) inch in size.  The sign shall also include a
statement that generally informs the reader both that violating the park
hours constitutes a criminal offense and the maximum penalty that can be
imposed.  The removal of posted signs shall not constitute a defense to the
penalty provision set forth herein.  Entering or remaining in a park before
or after 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. shall be punishable as a second degree
misdemeanor as provided in Fla. Stat. §§ 775.082 and 775.083.

at a reasonable price, the City may utilize the competitive sealed proposal
process.  A Request for Proposals (RFP) shall be used as the solicitation
document.

interested and qualified firms so that the City may enter into simultaneous
negotiations with the firm or firms determined most capable of providing the
required supplies and services.



      (3)   The ITN document will supply the firms with information
necessary to understand the need; however, the terms, scope of work, price,
method of delivery, conditions of performance, and approaches of the project
may be open to consideration and negotiations, including simultaneous
negotiations with the most qualified firms.

      (1)   When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a
purchase description to support an award based on price or detailed scope of
work, any competitive solicitation may be preceded by a Request for
Information (RFI) requesting the submission of unpriced submittals, which
will provide input for the specifications or scope of work to be included in
a subsequent competitive solicitation.



      (2)   The RFI process shall be further delineated in the
Procurement Manual and the RFI document.



   (F)   Alternative source selection.



      (1)   Small purchases.  Any purchase for an amount less than
the mandatory City Council approval amount shall be made in accordance with
those procedures promulgated in the Procurement Manual, provided, however, no
purchase shall be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase
under this section.



      (2)   Sole source purchases. 



         (a)   The Chief Procurement Officer may make or
authorize the purchase of goods and/or services, subject to the mandatory
City Council approval level stipulated in this Ordinance, without competitive
solicitation when the director of the client department has documented in
writing that such good and/or service is the only item that meets the need
and is available through only one source of supply, or when the intent to
award via sole source is posted on the City's website for a reasonable time
period but at a minimum of seven (7) calendar days, or when a documented
research effort by the Chief Procurement Officer fails to identify further
competing sources of the goods or services.  Such written determinations and
supporting documentation shall be retained by the Chief Procurement Officer
for public inspection and auditing purposes.



         (b)   Where standardization is determined by the Chief
Procurement Officer to be appropriate, and negotiation of such standard items
is appropriate, a sole source determination is justified.



         (c)   The sole source process shall be further
delineated in the Procurement Manual. 



      (3)   Emergency purchases. The Chief Procurement Officer may
make or authorize emergency purchases as defined herein.



         (a)   In the event of an emergency, such as a
declaration of emergency pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 252.38, by the Governor,
or Fla. Stat. § 252.38, by the County or City, an equipment failure,
catastrophic damage to City property, or other similar unexpected event, all
formal competitive bidding procedures are waived, and normal procurement
procedures and requirements directly related to such emergency shall be
suspended; and with the approval of the City Manager or the Chief Procurement
Officer, the head of any department may purchase any required emergency
supplies, materials, equipment or services. The head of such department shall
send to the Chief Procurement Officer a requisition and copy of the delivery
record together with a full justification and circumstances of the emergency.



         (b)   Records of emergency purchases shall be maintained
by the Chief Procurement Officer. 



         (c)   A record listing of all emergency purchases
exceeding the mandatory City Council approval amount shall be submitted to
the City Council within ninety (90) days of said purchase. 



         (d)   The emergency purchase process shall be further
delineated in the Procurement Manual.



      (4)   Cooperative purchases. 



         (a)   The City may purchase from any cooperative
contract, including but not limited to:  term contracts by the State of
Florida, Federal General Services Administration, and other governmental
cooperatives and entities within and outside the State of Florida provided
that the cooperative contract is established in compliance with the
procurement procedures and requirements of the issuing body, entity,
authority, or cooperative.



         (b)   If such other governmental or cooperative contract
is utilized, the public notice requirements and the need to utilize the
methods of selection processes included in this Ordinance are obviated.



         (c)   The ability to utilize cooperative contracts shall
not be restricted by nonparticipation in the estimated quantities of the
City's needs, nor inaccurate estimates of usage by the City prior to award of
the cooperative contract.



         (d)   The City may utilize (piggyback) a contract
entered into by another governmental or public entity and a provider of
supplies or services required by the City, if the Chief Procurement Officer
determines that it is practicable and advantageous for the City to employ
this method of purchase, and such contracts specify that they are cooperative
procurements at the time of solicitation.  Any such contracts equal to or in
excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) shall go to the City
Council for approval.



         (e)   Other governmental agencies are authorized to
utilize the City's contracts.



         (f)   City departments may utilize (piggybacking) a
contract established for another City department, provided such usage is in
accordance with the same terms, conditions and pricing.



         (g)   The cooperative purchasing process shall be
further delineated in the Procurement Manual.



      (5)   Design-build services. 



         (a)   The City may use a design-build consultant
contracted through a competitive solicitation process to prepare a
design-criteria package. 



         (b)   The design-build process shall be further
delineated in the Procurement Manual.



      (6)   Capital improvement and construction services. The
contracting and purchase of construction services shall be acquired in
accordance with the competitive sealed bidding process.  Performance bonds
and payment bonds shall be in the maximum amounts stipulated in Fla. Stat. §
255.05.  The capital improvement and construction contracting process shall
be further delineated in the Procurement Manual and the IFB document.



      (7)   Construction Management at Risk Services (CM@R).  The
procuring of CM@R service shall be acquired in accordance with the Request
for Qualifications process.  The CM@Risk shall be further delineated in the
Procurement Manual and the RFQ document.



      (8)   Negotiated purchases.  Negotiation of contracts and
pricing via any method of selection process identified herein, shall be by
means promulgated in the Procurement Manual.



   (G)   Public-private partnerships. The procurement of personal
property and services for public-private partnerships (P3) shall be in
accordance with Fla. Stat. § 255.065.

      (2)   Conceptual proposal.



         (a)   A private entity may submit a conceptual proposal
to the City, to gauge the City's potential interest in pursuing the proposed
project as a P3.  A conceptual proposal is not required.  A private entity
may forego submitting a conceptual proposal and submit an unsolicited
detailed proposal.



         (b)   A private entity must tender a proposal review fee
of five thousand dollars ($5,000) with its conceptual proposal.  The City
will not review a conceptual proposal that is not accompanied by the payment
of this fee.



         (c)   A conceptual proposal must contain information
sufficient to inform the City about (1) the overall character of the proposed
qualifying project, (2) the general experience of the private entity, and (3)
the general strategies to ensure successful project delivery.



         (d)   Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the

(1) the proposed project is a qualifying project; (2) the proposed project
delivery model offers advantages over traditional models, for example, lower
cost, shorter schedule, increased investment, etc.; (3) the proposed project
is reasonably likely to satisfy the criteria established by the P3 Statute. 



         (f)   Upon completion of review of the conceptual

            1.   Decide not to pursue the proposed project;



            2.   Decide to pursue the proposed project, or a
similar project, using other procurement methods (in which, if open to
private companies, the private entity may compete if otherwise qualified); or



            3.   Decide to continue considering the proposed
project under the P3 Statute and request the private entity to submit a
detailed proposal (which request shall not constitute a formal solicitation).



         (g)   The City's disposition of a conceptual proposal
does not limit its discretion or authority with respect to future projects,
whether solicited or unsolicited. 



      (3)   Unsolicited detailed proposals.



         (a)   A private entity may submit an unsolicited
detailed proposal to the City, to initiate the City's consideration of
whether to deem the proposed project as a qualifying project and whether to
pursue it further under the P3 Statute.  The City is not obligated to pursue
a project under the P3 Statute, even if the project satisfies the statutory
definition of a qualifying project.



         (b)   A private entity must tender a proposal review fee
of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) with its detailed proposal, unless
the private entity has already paid a fee for review of a substantially
similar conceptual proposal, in which case the proposal review fee is twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000). The City will not review a detailed proposal that
is not accompanied by the payment of this fee.  The proposal review fee is
non-refundable.



         (c)   A detailed proposal must contain information
sufficient to inform the City about: the detailed quality and character of
the proposed qualifying project; the detailed experience and capacity of the
private entity; and the detailed financial and implementation strategies to
ensure successful project delivery.  This information should include the
following:



            1.   A description of the private entity,
including name, address, type of organization, and legal structure.



            2.   Name and complete contact information of the
primary point of contact for the detailed proposal.



            3.   Names and experience of proposed key project
personnel.



            4.   Type of support needed, if any, from the
City, for example, facilities, equipment, materials, personnel, financial

professionals the private entity has or intends to consult with respect to
the project.



            7.   The names of any other federal, state, or
local agencies receiving the same proposal. 



            8.   A complete discussion of the objective of the
project, the method of approach, the nature of the anticipated results, and
the characteristics that make it a qualifying project worthy of pursuit by
the City.



            9.   A detailed overview of the proposed business
arrangements, including the plan for the development, financing, and
operation of the project.



            10.   A preliminary project schedule.

proposed project.



            12.    Specification as to when the pricing or
terms of the proposal will expire. 



         (d)   Within ninety (90) business days after receipt of
the detailed proposal, the City will notify the private entity in writing of
the City's decision either to reject the detailed proposal or to accept the
detailed proposal for competitive review.  During this period, the City may
meet with the private entity to gain a deeper understanding of the detailed
proposal, and the City may request that the private entity submit additional
information.  These meetings will be preliminary in nature, and will not
include or constitute substantive negotiation of agreement terms.  In
considering whether to accept the detailed proposal for competitive review,
the City will assess whether: (1) the proposed project is a qualifying
project; (2) the proposed project delivery model offers advantages over
traditional models, for example, lower cost, shorter schedule, increased
investment, etc.; (3) the proposed project is reasonably likely to satisfy
the criteria established by the P3 Statute.  The City may determine that it
requires more than ninety (90) days to complete its review of the detailed
proposal and this assessment, in which case it will notify the private entity
in writing of how much time will be required.



         (e)   An unsolicited proposal may be rejected by the
City at any time.  The City has complete discretion and authority to reject
any unsolicited proposal it receives.



         (f)   If the City decides to accept an unsolicited
proposal for competitive review, the City will provide written notice of its
decision, and a copy of the unsolicited proposal, to affected local
jurisdictions in accordance with subsection (7) of the P3 Statute.



         (g)   If the City decides to accept an unsolicited
proposal for competitive review, the City will advertise the potential
opportunity and accept competing detailed proposals.



            1.   The advertisement will include: a general
description of the qualifying project; an invitation to submit a competing
detailed proposal for the qualifying project with or without a proposal
review fee, which may propose the identical project, a functionally
equivalent project, or an alternative project that achieves the same purpose
or uses the same City resources as the proposed project; information about
how to obtain more detailed information; and a due date for responding, which
ordinarily will be forty-five (45) days after initial publication, but which
may be up to one hundred twenty (120) days as the circumstances warrant.



            2.   The City will advertise the potential
opportunity in the Florida Administrative Register at least once a week for
three consecutive weeks; in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City at least once a week for three weeks prior to the due date for competing
proposals; on the City's website in the same manner as competitive
solicitations; and at City Hall in the same manner as other public notices
issued by the City.



      (4)   Solicited detailed proposals.



         (a)   The City may on its own initiative determine to
issue a solicitation inviting private entities to submit detailed proposals
for any opportunity that the City has identified as a qualifying project. 



         (b)   Any solicitation that the City issues under the
authority of the P3 Statute will identify the P3 Statute and the City's
related Code sections as the governing procurement process.  The
solicitation documents will specify information necessary for interested
parties to understand and respond to the solicitation.



         (c)   If a solicited qualifying project includes design
work, the solicitation will include a design criteria package prepared by an
architect, landscape architect, or engineer licensed in this state, in
accordance with Fla. Stat. § 255.065(3)(c).  The design criteria package
will be sufficient to allow private entities to prepare a bid or a
response.  The licensed design professional who prepares the design criteria
package will remain in the service of the City until the qualifying project
is completed.



         (d)   The City is not obligated to proceed under the P3
Statute when soliciting proposals, and may follow any legally available
procurement process, regardless of whether the project qualifies as a
qualifying project and regardless of whether the ultimate transaction may be
characterized as a P3.



      (5)   Competitive review and negotiation of detailed proposals.



         (a)   Whether received in response to a solicitation
under the P3 Statute or in response to an advertisement concerning an
unsolicited proposal, within ten (10) days after the receipt of all competing
detailed proposals the City will designate a negotiation team to conduct
negotiations concerning the qualifying project.  The negotiation team will
consist of at least three (3) persons, including one City employee, who
collectively have knowledge and experience in contract negotiations, the
subject matter related to the qualifying project, public procurement, and
project management.  No person with a financial interest in the outcome of
the negotiation team's efforts or in the qualifying project may participate
on the negotiation team.



         (b)   The negotiation team's meetings are temporarily
exempt from the Sunshine Law as provided in Fla. Stat. (2014) § 286.0113(2),
and Fla. Stat. (2016) § 255.065(15).  The City will record and preserve as
required by law any exempt portion of a negotiation team meeting.



         (c)   The negotiation team may rely on subject matter
experts and staff for information gathering and administrative work, but the
negotiation team alone will possess and exercise authority for all
recommendations concerning the detailed proposals.



         (d)   The negotiation team will initially review the
detailed proposals and determine whether to allow oral presentations for the
purpose of gaining deeper understanding of the detailed proposals.  The
negotiation team is not required to allow oral presentations.  Any oral
presentations will be limited to reviewing and discussing information
contained in the detailed proposals, and will not include or constitute
substantive negotiations related to any detailed proposal or the qualifying
project.



         (e)   Within thirty (30) days after its appointment, or
after the final oral presentation, whichever is later, the negotiation team
will rank the detailed proposals in order of preference.  The negotiation
team may meet as often as it deems necessary before ranking, in order to
discuss details and strategies related to the detailed proposals and the
qualifying project.  The negotiation team will strive for consensus, but a
majority of the team may establish the ranking.  The negotiation team may
use any reasonable method to rank the detailed proposals, and is not required
to numerically score them.  In ranking the detailed proposals, the
negotiation team members will consider the private entity team members'
professional qualifications and experience, the proposed general business
terms,  innovative project delivery terms (including finance, design,
construction, maintenance, and operation, as applicable to the particular
circumstance), and any other factors indicated in the advertisement or
solicitation. 



         (f)   Following its ranking of detailed proposals, the
negotiation team will commence negotiations with the private entity
responsible for the top-ranked proposal.  The negotiation team will then
conduct negotiations in accordance with the P3 Statute.



         (g)   In its discretion, the negotiation team may
recommend that the City and the private entity enter into an interim
agreement as described in the P3 Statute.  The negotiation team is not
authorized to enter into or otherwise bind the City to an interim
agreement.  Any recommendation to enter into an interim agreement will be
brought to the City Council for consideration.  Only the City Council is
authorized to approve an interim agreement.



         (h)   The negotiation team may recommend that the City
and the private entity enter into a comprehensive agreement as described in
the P3 Statute.  The negotiation team is not authorized to enter into or
otherwise bind the City to a comprehensive agreement.  Any recommendation to
enter into a comprehensive agreement will be brought to the City Council for
consideration.  Only the City Council is authorized to approve a
comprehensive agreement.



         (i)   In deciding whether to enter into a comprehensive
agreement, the City Council will consider and determine all reasonable
factors, including but not limited to:



            1.   Whether the proposed project is a qualifying
project.



            2.   Whether the qualifying project is in the
public's best interest.



            3.   Whether the qualifying project involves a
facility that is owned by the City or for a facility for which ownership will
be conveyed to the City.



            4.   Whether the comprehensive agreement has
adequate safeguards in place to ensure that additional costs or service
disruptions are not imposed on the public in the event of material default by
the private entity or cancellation of the qualifying project by the City.



            5.   Whether the comprehensive agreement has
adequate safeguards in place to ensure that the City or the private entity
has the opportunity to add capacity to the qualifying project or other
facilities serving similar predominantly public purposes.



            6.   Whether the qualifying project will be owned
by the City upon completion or termination of the project and payment of
amounts financed.



            7.   Whether there is a public need for or benefit
derived from the qualifying project.



            8.   Whether the estimated cost of the qualifying
project is reasonable in relation to similar facilities.



            9.   Whether the comprehensive agreement will
result in the timely acquisition, design, construction, improvement,
renovation, expansion, equipping, maintenance, or operation of the qualifying
project.

p.m., local time, within five (5) business days after posting of the award
recommendation.



   (C)   The calculation of days shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and
holidays observed by the City.  The day of the award recommendation posting
shall not be included in the calculation.  Service of a protest by mail or
courier shall not expand the time period allowed for delivery of a protest.



   (D)   The formal written protest shall:



      (1)   Identify the protestant and the solicitation involved;



      (2)   Include a clear statement of the grounds on which the
protest is based;



      (3)   Refer to the statutes, laws, codes, or other legal
authorities which the protestant deems applicable to such grounds; and,



      (4)   Request the specific relief to which the protestant
deems itself entitled. 



   (E)   Protest bond/fee:  The formal protest must be accompanied by
a protest application fee/protest bond in the amount of five percent (5%) of
the total amount of the recommended purchase award; or if no dollar amount is
included in the purchase award recommendation, a protest application
fee/protest bond must be in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00).  The maximum (cap) amount of the protest application
fee/protest bond for any protest shall be five thousand dollars
($5,000.00).  The protest application fee/protest bond must be in the form
of a cashier's check, certified check, or an attorney's trust account check
payable to the City of Palm Bay.  Cash is not acceptable. 



   (F)   The written protest may not challenge the relative weight of
the evaluation criteria or any formula for assigning points in a competitive
solicitation.



   (G)   The protestant shall mail a copy of the formal written protest
to the firm or firms recommended for award, and shall provide the Chief
Procurement Officer with evidence of such mailing.

received by the office of the Chief Procurement Officer within the timeframe
specified above.



   (I)   Failure to file a written protest within the time period
specified shall result in relinquishment of all rights of protest by the
vendor and abrogation of any further protest proceedings. 



   (J)   The protest procedures herein shall be the sole remedy for
challenging a competitive solicitation.  Any and all costs incurred by a
protesting party in connection with a protest pursuant to this Ordinance
shall be the sole responsibility of the protesting party.



   (K)   Bidders and proposers are prohibited from attempts to
influence, persuade or promote through any other channels or means.  Such
attempts shall be cause for suspension in accordance with § 38.14 of this
Ordinance.



   (L)   The Chief Procurement Officer shall attempt to resolve the
protest in a fair and equitable manner. The judicial rules of evidence shall
not apply and the Chief Procurement Officer shall base his or her decision on
such information presented in the course of the proceeding upon which
reasonable persons rely in the conduct of their affairs. The Chief
Procurement Officer shall render a written decision to the protestant via
certified U. S. mail.



   (M)   The protestant may appeal such decision, in writing to the
City Council within three (3) business days of the vendor's receipt of the
written decision by the Chief Procurement Officer.

protest shall stay the award process with the exception of § 38.13(O) herein.



   (O)   The Chief Procurement Officer may make a determination that
the contract as originally recommended to be awarded shall be awarded without
delay is necessary to protect substantial interests of the City.  In that
case, the City Council may, in its sole discretion, dismiss the appeal or
reject all bids and proposals, which will render it moot.



   (P)   Nothing in this section is intended to affect the existing
powers of the City Council to settle actions pending before the Courts.  In
the event of a court upholding the protestant's claim, the court awarded

preparation costs, and reimbursement of the amount of the protest application
fee/protest bond as stipulated herein. 



   (Q)   The dispute resolution and protest process may be further
delineated in the Procurement Manual.

('74 Code, § 2-52)  (Ord. 82-15, passed 2-4-82; Am. Ord. 2006-57, passed
6-1-06)



§ 51.03  CONTINUANCE BY COUNCIL OR BOARDS.



   (A)   Continuances requested by an applicant on a matter that has
been advertised for a public hearing can only be granted by either the City
Council or the board before whom the public hearing has been scheduled. In
such circumstances, however, the applicant shall be required to participate
in the hearing in the event the City Council or board do not grant such
continuance.



   (B)   Should a scheduled public hearing be continued by the City
Council or a board upon the applicant's request, or upon request by the City
Council or a board, the matter shall be rescheduled for a specific date and
time as determined by the Council or board.  If no date and time are

rescheduled for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Council or
board.  No notice or publication shall be required, except as may be
provided by law.



   (C)   Should a scheduled first public hearing be continued by the

authorized representative, the matter shall be automatically rescheduled for
the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council or board.  Upon a
second occurrence of such failure to appear before the City Council or a
board, the applicant shall be charged a fee, which will equal half the
application fee of the requested action.  Failure to appear before the City
Council or a board for the scheduled public hearing for a third time will
result in a denial of the request.

6-1-06; Am. Ord. 2017-17, passed 2-16-17)

request made by an applicant and presented at a public hearing, the same or
similar issue presented at such public hearing cannot be refiled with the
City Council or any board for the minimum period of twelve (12) months after
the date of such denial.



   (B)   However, the City Council or any board may reconsider the same
or similar issue within the twelve (12) month period if a mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect has occurred as a result of the
actions of the applicant or the city, provided that the event directly or
indirectly formed a basis for the City Council's or any board's decision to
deny the request at the public hearing.



('74 Code, § 2-55)  (Ord. 82-15, passed 2-4-82; Am. Ord. 82-19, passed

Magistrate shall make the determination as to whether to settle a lien for

Petition for Relief (form on file) by an affected property owner or
prospective owner.  Approval of settlement, compromise or cancellation shall
be objectively based upon the following:



      (1)   The market value of the real property as most recently
determined by the Brevard County Property Appraiser;

more formal policy regulating the criteria for settlement, compromise or
cancellation of code enforcement liens. No reduction may be granted by the
Special Magistrate for a lien when current litigation exists in which the
primary litigants are the property owners and the city and in which the real
property is at issue.



(Ord. 2010-01, passed 1-21-10)



§ 52.091  PROCEDURE FOR SETTLEMENT OR COMPROMISE OF LIENS.



   (A)   The owner or a prospective purchaser of real property against
which a lien has been imposed pursuant to the action of the Code Enforcement
Board may file a Petition for Relief with the City Manager or his designee
seeking satisfaction of such code enforcement lien with less than full
payment thereof, including partial payment in conjunction with verified
improvements to the exterior of the real property.  No such application
shall be forwarded to the Special Magistrate for consideration hereunder
until the applicant has first shown that:



      (1)   All ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, city
utility charges and other government-imposed charges, fines or liens against
the subject real property have been paid or are current;



      (2)   All code violations have been corrected under required
permits issued therefore and appropriate affidavits of compliance are on-file
in the matter.



   (B)   In the event the property owner is seeking relief under this
section to facilitate a refinancing of the real property or to secure a home
equity loan, the property owner may apply for the relief notwithstanding
subsection (A), paragraph (1) above, provided a binding agreement is executed
whereby the unpaid taxes, assessments, other liens or other indebtedness will
be fully satisfied at the closing of the refinancing or home equity loan.



   (C)   Petition for Relief.  In considering an application to reduce
a lien imposed by the Code Enforcement Board, no settlement or satisfaction
thereof shall be approved by the Special Magistrate with less than full
payment thereof, unless the Special Magistrate hears the matter as a
quasi-judicial hearing at a public meeting (not a public hearing). 
Subsequent to the hearing, the Special Magistrate shall make specific
findings that no violation of any city ordinance currently exists on the
subject real property, or that a prospective purchaser has agreed to correct
such violations on or before a date certain, which agreement is evidenced by
a written agreement.



   (D)   Settlement of Litigation.  In considering whether to
authorize a reduction of a lien imposed by the Code Enforcement Board to
bring a litigation matter to closure, no settlement or satisfaction thereof
shall be approved by the Special Magistrate with less than full payment
thereof, until the Special Magistrate receives a recommendation from both the
City Attorney and the City Manager in writing, is fully apprised of the
market value of the property, the amount of the lien(s), and any other
extenuating circumstances.  If time is of the essence, this determination
does not require a public meeting at the time a decision is rendered;
however, the settlement decision shall be ratified by the Special Magistrate
at the next public meeting of the Special Magistrate and the full amount of
the lien shall be placed in escrow by the closing agent until such time as
the Magistrate's order is ratified.



   (E)   Urgent Settlements.  In the event an applicant requests that
a Petition for Relief be considered prior to the next regularly scheduled
hearing date, good cause must be shown.  Good cause may include, but is not
limited to, an unexpected short closing date for the purchase of real
property.  The Special Magistrate has the sole discretion to determine
whether the matter involves a legitimate urgency which requires resolution
prior to the next scheduled hearing.  Before making a determination under
this subsection, the Special Magistrate shall receive a recommendation from
both the City Attorney and the City Manager in writing, shall be fully
apprised of the market value of the property, the amount of the lien(s), and
any other extenuating circumstances.  This determination does not require a
public meeting at the time a decision is rendered; however, the settlement
decision shall be ratified by the Special Magistrate at the next public
meeting of the Special Magistrate and the full amount of the lien shall be
placed in escrow by the closing agent until such time as the Magistrate's
order is ratified.

foregoing requirements shall be grounds for termination of this franchise
pursuant to the terms of Section 9 hereof; provided, however, that the City
may in its discretion extend the time for the completion of construction and
installation for additional periods in the event the Company, acting in good
faith, experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control.



   C.   In the event the operation of any part of a cable television

upon being given ten (10) days notice, remove from the streets or public
places all such property and poles of such system. Any property which the
Company allows to remain in place sixty (60) days after having been notified

abandoned and shall become the property of the City subject to the provision
of any utility joint use attachment agreement.

final passage of this ordinance, file with the City Clerk of the City a
written acceptance of this ordinance and the franchise herein granted,
agreeing that it will comply with all the provisions and conditions hereof
and that it will refrain from doing all things prohibited by this ordinance.

standards as set forth in Section 76.309 of the Rules of the Federal
Communication Commission.  The Company shall adopt procedures for the

the City various streets which the City does not have the unqualified right
to authorize the Company to use, because of reservations in favor of the
dedicators or because of other legal impediments; therefore, in making this
grant, the City does not warrant or represent as to any particular street or
portion of a street that it has the right to authorize the Company to install
or maintain portions of its cable system therein, and in each case the burden
and responsibility for making such determination in advance of the
installation shall be upon the Company.

property.



   (m)   All poles, lines, structures and other facilities of the
Company, in, on, over and under the streets, sidewalks, alleys, easements and

times in a safe and substantial condition.



   (n)   The Company shall, on the request of any person holding a
building moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its
lines to permit the moving of the buildings.  The expense of such temporary
removal shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the Company shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance.  The Company shall be
given not less than ten (10) business days notice of a contemplated move to
arrange for temporary wire changes.



   (o)   The City shall have the right to inspect the system with
reasonable notice and during regular business hours, with a Company
representative present, to insure compliance with the above provisions.



   (p)   At the request of the City, the Company will establish a

sidewalk, driveway or any other surfacing (hereafter “improvements”), the
Company shall at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
City Manager replace and restore any improvements so disturbed in as good
condition as before said work was commenced.  The Company will post a bond
in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) with the City for its
faithful performance of the conditions of this paragraph, said bond to be
approved by the City Manager.



Section 8.  System Service.



   (a)   All structures, lines and equipment erected by the Company
within the City shall be located so as to cause no interference with the
proper use of streets, alleys, easements and other public ways and places and
to minimize interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of
property owners and the Company shall comply with all proper and lawful
ordinances of the City now or hereafter in force. Existing poles, posts and
other such structures of the City or utility which may be available to the
Company for leasing or licensing at reasonable terms shall be used to the
extent practicable in order to minimize interference with travel.  No new
poles shall be erected by the Company without the consent of the City Manager.



   (b)   In case of any disturbance of improvements, the Company shall
at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City replace and
restore all improvements so disturbed in as good condition as before said
work was commenced.



   (c)   In the event that at any time during the period of this
franchise the City shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley,
easement or other public way requiring the relocation of the facilities of
the Company, then in such event the Company upon reasonable notice by the
City, shall remove and relocate the same at Company's own expense.



   (d)   The Company shall extend cable television service to any
residence within the City which is located within two hundred (200) feet of
any portion of the distribution facilities of the Company existing at the
time of the application of service, except to the extent that density of
homes, adverse terrain, or other factors render making service available
impractical.  Such extension shall be made within sixty (60) days after
receipt of a reasonable request for such service except where permitting
takes a longer period of time.  There shall, however, be no obligation on
the part of the Company to extend feeder cable service unless there is a
density of at least thirty (30) subscribers per feeder cable mile in the area
of the person making the request for service.  The Company shall provide one
(1) basic service outlet to all municipal facilities and public schools
within the City's franchise area at no cost to the City or school involved
provided, however, that the structure to be served is within two hundred
(200) feet of the Company's distribution system except to the extent that
adverse terrain or other factors render making service impractical or cost
prohibitive.  The Company shall serve any building beyond two hundred (200)
feet if the owner of said building pays the cost of the extension to such
building.



   (e)   The Company shall make available, to any residential
subscriber so requesting, a parental “lock-out” device.  The Company
shall advise all residential subscribers regarding the availability of this
device, and an additional reasonable charge for any such device may be
imposed.



   (f)   In the case of an emergency or disaster, the Company shall
provide emergency override capability on cable channels for transmission of
emergency or disaster information.  This service shall be shared and
coordinated with Brevard County and the other governmental entities within
Brevard County served by the same system.



   (g)   The Company at all times shall be solely responsible for
complying fully with all applicable regulations from time to time established
by the FCC, and any other state or federal agency which now or hereafter has
jurisdiction over the cable television activities of the Company, and it is
expressly agreed that the Company may be entitled to renegotiate or amend the
provisions hereof because amended or newly enacted regulations of the
Company's activities and business are more onerous or expensive for the
Company to implement.



Section 9.  Government Access Channel.



   At the time of the contemplated system upgrade, the Company shall
designate a channel for governmental use.  This channel shall be shared by
the various governmental entities served by the same company system.  Any
segment of the Government access channel established for the City shall be
under sole control of the City.  Any City programming must meet technical
standards of Grantee.



Section 10.  Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.



   The Company shall not as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules,
regulations, or in any other respect make or grant any preference or
advantage to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or
disadvantage; provided, however, this shall not be deemed to prohibit the
establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rates schedules
to which any customer coming within such classification shall be entitled. 
This provision shall not apply to discounts provided to owners or operators
of multiple unit dwelling complexes when such discounts or contract rates are
provided under contract or “bulk” agreements.



Section 11.  City Police Power.



   The right is hereby reserved to the City to adopt, in addition to the
provisions herein contained and existing applicable ordinances, such
additional ordinances as it shall find necessary in the exercise of the
police power, provided that such regulations shall be reasonable and not in
conflict with the rights herein granted and not in conflict with the laws of
the State of Florida or the United States of America.



Section 12.  Franchise Term.

safety and welfare of the citizens of Palm Bay to renew this franchise.

§ 54.10  FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT  COMPANY [ORDINANCE NO. 2004-12]



An Ordinance Granting to Florida Power & Light Company, Its Successors and
Assigns, an Electric Franchise, Imposing Provisions and Conditions Relating
Thereto, and Providing for Monthly Payments to the City.



Be It Enacted by the City of Palm Bay, Florida:



Section 1.



   There is hereby granted to Florida Power & Light Company, its
successors and assigns (hereinafter called the "Grantee"), for the period of
thirty (30) years from the effective date hereof, the nonexclusive right,
privilege and franchise (hereinafter called "franchise") to construct,
operate and maintain in, under, upon, along, over and across the present and
future roads, streets, alleys, bridges, easements, rights-of-way and other
public places (hereinafter called "public rights-of-way") throughout all of
the incorporated areas, as such incorporated areas may be constituted from
time to time, of the City of Palm Bay, Florida, and its successors
(hereinafter called the "Grantor"), in accordance with the Grantee's
customary practice with respect to construction and maintenance, electric
light and power facilities, including, without limitation, conduits, poles,
wires, transmission and distribution lines, and all other facilities
installed in conjunction with or ancillary to all of the Grantee's operations
(hereinafter called "facilities"), for the purpose of supplying electricity
and other services to the Grantor and its successors, the inhabitants
thereof, and persons beyond the limits thereof. This grant of authority to
Grantee excludes telecommunication services for resale to third parties.



Section 2.



   The facilities of the Grantee shall be installed, located or relocated
so as to not unreasonably interfere with traffic over the public
rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting
property. To avoid conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all
facilities shall be made as representatives of the Grantor may prescribe in
accordance with the Grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference
to the placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said
public rights-of-way; provided, however, that such rules or regulations (a)
shall not prohibit the exercise of the Grantee's right to use said public
rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor
vehicular traffic, (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's
ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric
service to all of its customers, and (c) shall not require the relocation of
any of the Grantee's facilities installed before or after the effective date
hereof in public rights-of-way unless or until widening or otherwise changing
the configuration of the paved portion of any public right-of-way used by
motor vehicles causes such installed facilities to unreasonably interfere
with motor vehicular traffic.  Such rules and regulations shall recognize
that above-grade facilities of the Grantee installed after the effective date
hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of the public
rights-of-way to the extent possible. When any portion of a public
right-of-way is excavated by the Grantee in the location or relocation of any
of its facilities, the portion of the public right-of-way so excavated shall
within a reasonable time be replaced by the Grantee at its expense and in as
good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. The Grantor shall
not be liable to the Grantee for any cost or expense in connection with any
relocation of the Grantee's facilities required under subsection (c) of this
Section, except, however, the Grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of
its costs from others and as may be provided by law.



Section 3.



   The Grantor shall not be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever
for any accident, personal injury, property damage or any claim or damage
that may occur in the course of the construction, installation, operation or
maintenance by Grantee, its employees, agents, contractors, sublessees or
licensees of any of its facilities, except for damage specifically caused by
or arising out of the negligence, strict liability, intentional torts or
criminal acts of the Grantor. Nothing in this Franchise Agreement shall be
construed to affect in any way the Grantor's rights, privileges, immunities
under the doctrine of "sovereign immunity" as set forth in § 768.28, Florida
Statutes. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, and hold harmless the Grantor, its
officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, suits,
actions and causes of action arising during the term of this Franchise
Agreement and resulting in personal injury, loss of life or damage to
property sustained by any person or entity, caused by or arising out of
Grantee's negligent construction, operation or maintenance of its electric
system facilities within the City of Palm Bay, including all costs, attorneys
fees, expenses, including any appeal, or proceeding and any order, judgment
or decree which may be entered in any such action or proceeding, except for
damages specifically caused by or arising out of negligence, strict
liability, intentional torts or criminal acts of the Grantor, its officers,
agents, employees or contractors.  Nothing in this Franchise Agreement shall
be construed to affect in any way the Grantor's rights, privileges, and
immunities under the doctrine of "sovereign immunity" as set forth in §
768.28, Florida Statutes.



Section 4.



   All rates and rules and regulations established by the Grantee from
time to time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law.



Section 5.



   As a consideration for this Franchise Agreement, the Grantee shall pay
to the Grantor, commencing ninety (90) days after the effective date hereof,
and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this Franchise
Agreement, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises,
fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem
property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property and charges for
municipal services including, but not limited to water, sewer, stormwater and
inspection fees) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's
property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the
Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment
will equal five point nine percent (5.9%) of the Grantee's billed revenues,
less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential,
commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's
tariff) within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing
period ending sixty (60) days prior to each such payment, and in no event
shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed five point
nine percent (5.9%) of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the
Grantee.



   The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in
the preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing Franchise, Section
54.10, Code of Ordinances, to the precise revenues described therein, and
that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a)
revenues from the sale of electrical energy for Public Street and Highway
Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from
Other Sales to Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to
governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and Railways
(service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues
from Sales for Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e)
franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h)
other service charges.



Section 6.



   As a further consideration, during the term of this Franchise Agreement
or any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the
distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric
capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility
service (herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution
system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the
Grantee, (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement,
the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit
and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third
party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek
to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or
electric energy generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to
the Grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified
herein shall prohibit the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or
persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the
Federal Power Act.



   Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i)
from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other
person, or (ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute
to any facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy
purchased by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that
before the Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric
energy from any other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such
notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions
which have been offered by the other person and identify the Grantor's
facilities to be served under the offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have
ninety (90) days to evaluate the offer and, if the Grantee offers rates,
terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the
other person, the Grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the
Grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the
previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term no shorter than
that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree to rates,
terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of
the terms and conditions of this Franchise Agreement shall remain in effect.



Section 7.



   If the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other
person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or
maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the
incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or
compete on terms and conditions which the Grantee determines are more
favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at
any time thereafter terminate this Franchise Agreement if such terms and
conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The
Grantee shall give the Grantorat least sixty (60) days advance written notice
of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of
the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of such terms
and conditions that it considers more favorable. The Grantor shall then have
sixty (60) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and
conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the Grantee determines that such
terms or conditions are not remedied by the Grantor within said time period,
the Grantee may terminate this Franchise Agreement by delivering written
notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall be effective on the date
of delivery of such notice.



Section 8.



   If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory
or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or
any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision
of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within
the incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the
Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the
incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve,
and the Grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise
resulting from this Franchise Agreement in respect to rates and service,
place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the
Grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this
Franchise Agreement if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within
the time period provided hereafter.  The Grantee shall give the Grantor at
least ninety (90) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. 
Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the
Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the consequences of such action which
resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have ninety
(90) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive
disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not remedied by the Grantor
within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this Franchise Agreement
by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall
take effect on the date of delivery of such notice.



Section 9.



   Failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial respect
with any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture,
but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety
thereof is protested by the Grantee until there is final determination (after
the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect
with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six
months after such final determination to make good the default before a
forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to
grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in
the case require.



Section 10.



   Failure on the part of the Grantor to comply in substantial respect
with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to:
(a) denying the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than
unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing
conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the
terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the
Grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public
rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the
Grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5
hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent
jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. The parties
recognize and agree that nothing in this Franchise Agreement constitutes or
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of a party's delegated sovereign right
of condemnation and that each party, in their sole discretion, may exercise
such right.



Section 11.



   If during the term of this franchise the Grantee enters into a
Franchise Agreement with any other municipality located in Brevard County,
Florida, the population of which is equal to or less than that of theGrantor,
the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee
at a rate greater than six percent (6%) of the Grantee's residential,
commercial and industrial revenues, under the same terms and conditions as
specified in Section 5 hereof, the Grantee, upon written request of the
Grantor, shall negotiate and enter into a new Franchise Agreement with the
Grantor in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments
under Section 5 hereof shall be no greater than that percentage which the
Grantee has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to the
other Brevard County municipality, provided, however, that such new Franchise
Agreement shall include additional benefits to the Grantee, in addition to
all benefits provided herein, at least equal to those provided by its
franchise agreement with the other Brevard County municipality. Subject to
all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence,
the Grantor shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be
used in calculating monthly payments, and the Grantee shall have the sole
discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under
any such new franchise agreement.

after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the Grantor's expense,

franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such
examination shall be during normal business hours at the Grantee's office
where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the
ordinary course of business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as
the Grantor and the Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the
Grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken

reported to the Grantee.

grounds, shall be subject to all the terms of this Franchise Agreement within
ninety (90) days of receiving reasonable and sufficient written notice from
the Grantor.

repair, restore the construction site to as nearly the same order and
condition as it was prior to excavation as is reasonably possible. Such
restoration shall be maintained in an approved condition for a period of one
(1) year after its completion. Any unreasonable obstruction of any street,
avenue, alley, bridge, easement or other public place or way of the City not
removed by the Company after written notice of ten (10) days by the City

mains included in such extension. when there is less than one (1) consumer
using gas service for other than heating to each two hundred (200) feet of
proposed extended mains, the Company shall not be required to make such
extension until the applicant for service along such extension shall have
deposited with the Company a sum of money sufficient to cover the cost of any
length of the extension and excess of the length in feet of two hundred (200)
times the number of additional consumers served thereby. In such cases the
Company shall refund to the applicant the cost of two hundred (200) feet of
main as each additional consumer on said line is served until the entire

seeking to recover damages resulting from or attributable to the operations
or the existence of the Company within the City or arising in any manner
whatsoever out of the operations or existence of the Company within the City,
whether due to the Company's negligence or otherwise, the Company shall, upon
written notice by the City, defend the said suit or action and, in the event
any judgment therein should be rendered against the City, the Company shall

fee resulting therefrom.

An Ordinance of the City of Palm Bay, Brevard County, Florida, Granting to
Horizon Gas of Palm Bay, Inc., a Non-Exclusive Franchise to Import,
Transport, Sell and Distribute Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Heating,
Illuminating and Other Purposes in the City of Palm Bay, Brevard County,
Florida; Setting Forth the Conditions and Privileges Accompanying the Grant
of Franchise; Establishing Annual Franchise Fees; Providing for Review of
Plans and Specifications; Requiring Compliance with Regulations; Providing
for Indemnification; Requiring Comprehensive Liability Insurance;
Establishing Service Standards; Providing for Franchise Purchase Option;
Providing for Severability; Providing that This Ordinance is Also a Contract;
Reserving Certain Powers to the City.



   WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Palm Bay, Florida
(“City”), may grant franchises for the right and privilege to import,
transfer, distribute and sell liquefied petroleum gas (hereafter referred to
as “gas”) for heating, illuminating, cooking and other purposes within
the city limits of the City; and,



   WHEREAS, the City Council may grant such a franchise to applicants who
desire to construct, operate, and maintain gas facilities within City-owned
or controlled rights-of-way, easements or other dedicated areas; and,



   WHEREAS, Horizon Gas of Palm Bay, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the
“Company”) has requested of the City both, the grant of a franchise and
the privilege to utilize the streets, alleys, avenues, bridges, easements of
the City, with conditions; and,



   WHEREAS, the City has deemed it to be in the best  interest of  the 
recipients of gas  service  in  the  City to grant  a  non-exclusive 
franchise  to  the Company for the construction and operation of a gas
system within the city limits,



   Now therefore, be it enacted by the City Council of the City of Palm
Bay, Brevard County, Florida:



Section 1. Grant and Renewal of Franchise. 



   The City Council hereby grants a franchise to the Company, its
successors and assigns, as a non-exclusive right for a period of seventeen
(17) years from the original adoption date of September 1, 1994. This
franchise shall include the right and privilege to import, transport,
distribute and sell liquified petroleum gas (hereinafter referred to
generally as "gas") for heating, illuminating, cooking and other purposes,
within the limits of the City as the same now exists or as they may be
extended in the future and for the purpose to establish the necessary
equipment and to maintain storage facilities, gas main, service pipe, and any
other appurtenances necessary to the sale, transportation and distribution of
gas, in, under, upon, across and along the present and future places,
streets, alleys, avenues, bridges, easements or other public places of way of
such municipality, and to do all things which are, necessary, or customary in
the accomplishment of this objective; subject, however, to the further
provisions of this franchise; provided, however, that before said Company
shall construct or expand its facilities, the approval of the governing body
of the City of the location thereof, in the exercise of the discretion of
said governing body of the City, shall be first obtained by said Company. The
Company's facilities shall always be installed and operated in compliance of
the zoning and building ordinances of the City.



Section 2. Obstructing Streets. 



   The Company shall exercise its privileges hereunder subject at all
times to the police power of the City and shall not unnecessarily or
unreasonably obstruct the use of or injure any street, avenue, alley, or
other public place or way, and shall, upon the completion of any construction
or repair, restore all streets, avenues, alleys, or other public places or
way of the municipality which shall be opened by it or its agents or
employees for the purpose of laying, placing,  or repairing  its
aforesaid  gas  mains and or service pipes to as nearly the same order and
condition as they were before the excavation was made as is reasonably
possible.  Any obstruction of any street, alley, park, boulevard, bridge, or
other public place or way, or any failure properly to fill and maintain a
street after excavation, after notice of fifteen (15) working days demanding
a removal or repair, as the case may be, shall be moved or repaired by the
City and the cost thereof, which cost shall exceed the average cost charged
for similar work by the private sector, plus ten percent (10%) for
administration and engineering expense, shall be charged against the Company
and the City shall be reimbursed for the total cost.



Section 3. Acceptance. 



   The Company shall execute the acceptance of this franchise located
below and file the same with the City within thirty (30) days after the date
of adoption of this ordinance.  The franchise shall go into effect when the
acceptance has been filed with the City Clerk of the City of Palm Bay.



Section 4. Franchise Fees.



   Upon acceptance of this franchise, the Company shall pay to the City an
amount equal to seven and one-half percent (7½%) of the Company's gross
revenues from April 21, 1994 (the date of acquisition of the system by
Horizon Gas of Palm Bay, Inc.) until the date of acceptance of this franchise.



   Within thirty (30) days after the first anniversary date of this grant
and within thirty (30) days after each succeeding anniversary date of this
grant, the Company, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City and its
successors an amount which will equal seven and one-half percent (7½%) of
Company's gross revenues from the sale of gas to all gas customers within the
corporate limits of the City.  Gross revenue for purposes of this ordinance
shall be defined as the revenue received by the company for the sale of gas
and shall not include revenue from rental of or repairs to equipment.



   The City further agrees that should any other company be granted the
right to provide similar gas services in the city limits and should the
franchise fee charged  them be  less than  the sum set forth herein, then
the franchise fee charged the Company shall be reduced to the lowest fee
charged by the City to a Company in competition with the company herein.



Section 5. Rates and Charges.



   The Company, its successors and assigns, shall at all times be limited
in its charges for service furnished in accordance with this franchise to the
schedule of charges which shall be presented to and approved by the City
Council.  The gas rates currently in effect on the date of adoption of this
ordinance shall continue in effect pursuant to the terms of the previous
franchise contained in Ordinance No. 62-5, which was held by General
Development Utilities, Inc., until modified or changed by the parties
hereto.  The Company may, if it deems it necessary to amend or change said
schedule of charges, give the City notice in writing of same.  Within sixty
(60) days after notice as aforementioned, the City shall authorize and hold a
public hearing and within thirty (30) days after such public hearing, if the
City shall decline to act, then the Company may forthwith put into effect
such amendments or change of schedule.  It is understood and agreed that if
the Company should raise charges as hereinabove stated, the monies so
collected shall be escrowed by the Company with a national or state banking
institution, or the Company shall post with the City a good and sufficient
surety bond, for a period of ninety (90) days.  In the event the City should
deny the raise at any time during this ninety (90) day period, the Company
shall refund to its customers the monies collected by virtue of the raise. 
However, upon the expiration of the said ninety (90) days, the monies
collected, if no action is taken by the City theretofore, shall become the
funds of the Company and there shall be no further obligation on the part of
the Company to escrow any monies or in the case of a surety bond, said surety
bond will no longer be in force, and the increase in charges will continue
the same as if the request of the Company had been granted.  If at any time
the rates for the gas service are insufficient to maintain and operate with
an allowance for a fair return as determined by the formula and criteria used
by the L.P. Gas Division of the Agricultural Department of the State of
Florida on the replacement or reproduction value of the Company's property
used and useful in furnishing gas,  for maintenance and  operation of the 
Company and an allowance for the replacement of equipment, and an allowance
for debt service and an allowance being made for the depreciation of the gas
system which will include all pipe lines, storage tanks, machinery and
equipment and appurtenances thereto and in general all parts and portions of
the gas system in the entirety, and all taxes of every description levied or
imposed on the Company or its property, revenues, income and expenses, the
City shall have the right and power to fix and make effective such rates as
are reasonable, sufficient and compensatory, after taking into consideration
the matters herein referred to.  Any tax or charge imposed by any
governmental authority on the Company which is a tax imposed solely because
the Company is a utility, as distinguished from other individuals,
corporations or businesses in general, may be apportioned among the consumers
as a direct tax upon the consumers without resort to the City for permission
to increase the Company's rates.



Section 6. Review of Company's Plans and Specifications.



   The Company agrees that the location or relocation of all facilities
shall be made in compliance with such rules and regulations as are now or
hereafter may be imposed by the City.  The Company agrees that all plans and
specifications for the extension, location or relocation of any gas
facilities shall be approved by the City prior to commencement of any
construction.  Such approval shall not unreasonably interfere with the
proper operation and construction of the Company's facilities and services. 
The Company agrees to pay the inspection costs of the City in addition to the
franchise fee.  This inspection cost shall be a charge approved by the City
by ordinance.



Section 7. Compliance with Regulation.



   The Company agrees that in the construction, operation, extension,
expansion and maintenance of the gas system, it will, at all times, comply
with all City ordinances, comprehensive plan, statutes, and duly promulgated
rules, standards and regulations as may be imposed by the City, State or
Federal Government or their agencies and within their lawful authority.  The
City has the right, upon request, to inspect Company facilities and equipment
during normal Company working hours.



Section 8. Indemnification.



   The Company shall, at all times, protect, indemnify and save harmless
the City, its boards, officers, agents, representatives, officials, and
employees and any other city agencies and their members, officers,
representatives, agents, officials, and employees, against any and all
liabilities for injury to or death of any person or any damage to any
property or any other liability, including but not limited to reasonable
attorney's fees and court costs for both, trial and any appeals thereto,
caused by the company, the Company's officers, representatives, agents,
officials, contractors and all subcontractors, whether subcontractors of the
Company or the Company's contractors, or employees, in the construction,
operation, repair, or maintenance of its property, or arising out of the
exercise of any right or privilege under the franchise.



Section 9. Comprehensive Liability Insurance.



   At all times during the term of the franchise the Company will, at the
Company's expense, maintain in force general comprehensive liability
insurance with an insurance company approved by the City, the policy or
policies to be in form satisfactory to the City Attorney.  The coverage
represented by the policy or policies shall be for the protection of the
City, its officers, representatives, agents, officials, and employees against
liability for loss or damages for bodily injury, death, and property damage
occasioned by the activities of the Company under the franchise.  Minimum
liability limits under the policy or policies are to be one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) combined single limits for personal injury or death, or
damage to property resulting from any one occurrence and in the aggregate. 
The policies mentioned in the foregoing sentence shall each contain a
provision that a written notice of any cancellation or reduction in coverage
of the policies shall be delivered to the City ninety (90) days in advance of
the effective date of any cancellation.



Section 10. Service Standards.



   The Company shall at all times provide and furnish an adequate, safe
and continuous supply of liquefied petroleum gas to the City and its
inhabitants, subject,  however,  to  the  further  provisions of this
section.  The Company shall not be liable to the City or its inhabitants nor
shall the City, or any inhabitant who is a customer of the Company be liable
to the Company hereunder by reason of failure of the Company to deliver, or
of the City or a customer to receive, gas as a result of acts of God or the
public enemy, inability of pipeline suppliers or gas suppliers to furnish an
adequate supply due to an emergency, an order or decision of a public
regulatory body, or other acts beyond the control of the party affected. 
Whenever any of the occurrences named above take place, the Company shall
have the right and authority and it shall be its duty to adopt reasonable
rules and regulations in connection with limits curtailing or allocating
extensions of service or supplying of gas to any customer or prospective
customer, and withholding the selling of gas to new customers, provided that
such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each class of
customers, and shall be nondiscriminatory.  The Company shall have the right
to sell gas for industrial use on an interruptible basis, requiring the
customer to have standby equipment for the use upon notice by the Company. 
The Company rules, regulation, schedule or contracts for curtailing
interruptible gas service shall be uniform as applied to each class of
interruptible customers. If service is suspended because of any of the
reasons set forth above, occurring through no fault or negligent act on the
part of this Company, such suspension shall not be made the basis of an
action or proceeding to terminate this franchise.



Section 11.  Franchise Purchase Option.



   For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which the parties hereby acknowledge, the City hereby has the right to
purchase the pipeline system of the Company located within the City of Palm
Bay and the City shall provide written notice of intent to exercise its right
to purchase the company within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
the two (2) appraisals as hereinafter provided. After such notice by the
City, should it elect to exercise its right to purchase, the closing on such
sale and purchase shall occur within one hundred and twenty (120) days after
the City conducts any survey, investigation, evaluation or due diligence
(investigation), of whatever type or nature, it  deems  necessary.  Such 
investigation  shall  be concluded by the City within sixty (60) days after
providing notice of its intent to exercise its right to purchase under this
provision.



   The purchase price shall be determined, established and set as follows:



      a)   within ten (10) days after the City notifies the Company
of its intent to exercise its right to purchase the Company, both the City
and the Company shall select a professional and experienced appraiser,
appraising company or firm (appraiser) qualified to appraise and evaluate
entities that provide the same services and are in the same type of business
as the Company;



      b)   both appraisers shall utilize the same methods or
procedure of evaluation to determine the value of the Company;



      c)   the value of the Company shall be determined by adding
together the valuations established by each appraiser and dividing the sum
total of the two amounts by two (2); that is, the value and purchase price
for the Company shall be the average of the two (2) values set by the
appraisals;



      d)   should the appraisers be unable to agree upon the method
of evaluation to be utilized within five (5) days after their appointment,
then the City and the Company shall each submit to the appraisers the method
they deem appropriate.  The appraisers shall then utilize the method drawn
by lot from those submitted by the City and the Company.



      Should the City determine it does not desire to purchase the
Company after it conducts its investigation, the City shall notify the
Company and shall be thereafter relieved of any obligation or responsibility
to purchase.



Section 12. Approval of Transfer.



   No sale, assignment or lease of this franchise shall be effective until
it is approved by the City Council and until the vendee, assignee or lessee
has filed in the office of the City Clerk an instrument duly executed
reciting the fact of such a sale assignment  or  lease,  accepting  the 
terms  of  the franchise and an agreement to perform all the conditions

by any authorized leave of absence or vacation, provided that all members
similarly situated shall be treated alike pursuant to uniform,
nondiscriminatory rules. Leave granted pursuant to the Family and Medical
Leave Act shall not constitute a break in service for vesting or eligibility
purposes, but the period of such leave shall not be counted as credited
service for benefit purposes unless the member pays into the fund the member
contributions that would have been paid had the member not been on leave,
plus interest as determined by the Board, within ninety (90) days after the
member's return from leave, or within ninety (90) days following the

service, may purchase up to four (4) years of credited service for such prior
uniformed military experience or experience as a sworn law enforcement
officer, but not more than a combined total of four (4) years of credited
service, in accordance with this paragraph (4). The cost of the prior law
enforcement and/or military service purchased pursuant to this paragraph (4)
shall be based on the contributions the police officer member would have made
for the purchased time based upon the contribution rates and compensation of
the police officer member at the time of hire by the city. In addition to or
in lieu of a cash payment, the member may use the value of their accrued sick
and vacation leave to purchase all or a portion of the prior law enforcement
and/or military service purchased pursuant to this paragraph (4). The member
may use any combination of accrued sick or vacation leave, or a cash payment
to purchase all or a portion of the prior law enforcement and/or military
service. In no event may a member purchase more than four (4) years of prior
law enforcement and/or military service pursuant to this paragraph (4).
Effective August 3, 2007, a police officer member who is currently eligible
to purchase prior law enforcement and/or military service in accordance with
this paragraph (4) shall have thirty-six (36) months from August 3, 2007, to
purchase the prior law enforcement and/or military service provided for in
this paragraph (4).  Effective August 3, 2007, a police officer member shall

this paragraph (4).  The city reserves the right to provide input concerning
the actuarial methods and calculations to be used to determine the cost of
the prior law enforcement and/or military service purchased pursuant to this
paragraph (4). The city also reserves the right to engage an independent
actuary to review the methods and calculations of the plan actuary, and if
the two actuaries do not agree, the Board may consider the positions of both
actuaries in making a final determination as to the methods and calculations
to be used. All actuarial assumptions, cost methods, and procedures shall be
individually realistic and based on the actuary’s best estimates of
anticipated future experience under the plan.



      (5)   Any firefighter member, prior to retirement, shall have
the option to purchase up to four (4) years of military experience or four 
(4) years of paid sworn firefighter service, but not more than a combined
total of four (4) years. To receive credit for either military experience or
paid sworn firefighter service, the firefighter member shall pay the full
actuarial cost thereof, as determined by the actuary and as approved by the
Board. In no circumstances may a firefighter member purchase any military
experience or paid sworn firefighter service for which another benefit has
been obtained or will be obtained as a result of such experience. The Board

carry out the intent of this provision.

§ 55.04  BOARD OF TRUSTEES.



   (A)   The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility
for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the
provisions of this subchapter is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The
board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist

City Council; one (1) of whom shall be a police officer member of the system,
who shall be elected by a majority of the police officers who are members of
the system; and one (1) of whom shall be a firefighter member of the system,
who shall be elected by a majority of the firefighters who are members of the

name, the Palm Bay City Council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such
person to the board of trustees as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall
have the same rights as each of the other four (4) trustees appointed or
elected as herein provided and shall serve a two-year term unless he sooner
vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period
of two (2) years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced
by the Palm Bay City Council at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member
trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he
sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or firefighter
or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be
chosen in the same manner as originally. Each trustee may succeed himself in
office. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election

responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of
every kind, nature and description.



   (B)   The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect from their
number a chair, a vice-chair and a secretary. The secretary of the board
shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings or hearings of
the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may
receive expenses and per diem as provided by Florida law.



   (C)   Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three
(3) affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at
any meeting of the board.



   (D)   The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal and
other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system.
The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses
of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the
fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event
the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other
professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms
and conditions acceptable to the board.



   (E)   The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include,

      (1)   To construe the provisions of the system and determine
all questions arising thereunder.



      (2)   To determine all questions relating to eligibility and
membership.

allowances or other benefits hereunder.



      (4)   To establish uniform rules and procedures to be followed
for administrative purposes, benefit applications and all matters required to
administer the system.



      (5)   To distribute to members, from time to time, information
concerning the system.



      (6)   To receive and process all applications for benefits.

to notify the custodian, in writing, of approved benefit payments and other
expenditures arising through operation of the system.



      (8)   To have performed actuarial studies and valuations, at
least as often as required by law, and make recommendations regarding any and
all changes in the provisions of the system, including for benefit and other
improvements.



      (9)   To maintain or have maintained accurate records of

received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city,
and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

§ 55.05  FINANCES AND FUND MANAGEMENT; ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF FUND.



   (A)   As part of the system there exists the fund, into which shall
be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to
the system.



   (B)   The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets
thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements
from the fund may be made by the custodian but only upon written
authorization from the board.



   (C)   All funds of the system may be deposited by the board with the
city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, which shall be liable in the
same manner and to the same extent as it is liable for the safekeeping of
funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the city shall be
kept in a separate fund or clearly identified as such funds of the system. In
lieu thereof, the board may deposit the funds of the system in a qualified
public depository as defined in Fla. Stat. § 280.02, which depository with
regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions
of Fla. Stat. Chapter 280. In order to fulfill its investment
responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a
custodian.



   (D)   All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in
the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times
reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current
accounts and entries as regards the following:



      (1)   Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members
on both an individual and aggregate account basis; and



      (2)   Receipts and disbursements; and



      (3)   Benefit payments; and



      (4)   Current amounts clearly reflecting all movies, funds and
assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city;
and



      (5)   All interest, dividends and gains (or losses); and



      (6)   Such other entries as may be properly required so as to
reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund.



   (E)   An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public
accountant for the most recent plan year of the system showing a detailed
listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the
year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the
beginning and end of the year. Said report shall include other items normally
included in a certified audit.



   (F)   The Board, subject to the fiduciary standards in Fla. Stat.
§§ 112.656, 112.661, and 518.11, and the Code of Ethics in Fla. Stat. §§
112.311 through 112.3187, shall have the following investment powers and
authority, which may be delegated to one or more investment advisors selected
and supervised by the Board.



      (1)   The fund may be invested and reinvested in such
securities or property real or personal wherever situated and of whatsoever
kind, including but not limited to stocks, common or preferred, bonds and
other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, the Board of Trustees may invest up to twenty-five percent
(25%) of plan assets in foreign securities on a market-value basis.



      (2)   The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of
income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for
cash requirements of the system.



      (3)   No person or entity shall be liable for the making,
retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided,
nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its
own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.



      (4)   The board may cause any investment in securities held by
it to be registered in or transferred into the name of the fund or into the
name of such nominee as the board may direct, or it may retain them
unregistered solely to permit transferability, but the books and records
shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund.



      (5)   The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote
upon any stocks, bonds or securities of any corporation, association or trust
and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without
power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations,
recapitalizations, consolidations and similar transactions with respect to
such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting
trust or any protective or like committee or with the trustees or with
depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or
all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition
of assets; and generally, to exercise any of the powers of an owner with
respect to stocks, bonds or other investments of the fund which it may deem
to be to the best interest of the fund.



      (6)   At least once every three (3) years, and more often as
determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified
independent consultant, as defined in Fla. Stat. §§ 175.071 and 185.06, to
evaluate the performance of all existing investment advisors and make
recommendations regarding retention of all such investment advisors or
selection of replacements or additional investment managers. These
recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.



(Ord. 2000-15, passed 5-5-00; Am. Ord. 2013-45, passed 8-13-13)



§ 55.06  CONTRIBUTIONS.



   (A)   Member contributions.



      (1)   Amount:



         (a)   Police officer members shall contribute eight and
seventy-six one-hundredths percent (8.76%) of compensation, effective
September 30, 2000.



         (b)   Firefighter members shall contribute five and
twenty-nine one-hundredths percent (5.29%) of compensation, effective
September 30, 2001. Firefighter members shall contribute six and eighty-six
one-hundredths percent (6.86%) of compensation, effective October 1, 2003). 
Effective October 1, 2007, firefighter members shall contribute eight and
seventy-six one-hundredths percent (8.76%) of compensation.



   Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of members shall be
deposited in the fund immediately after each pay period. The contributions
made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions
pursuant to Section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon
the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal
Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions
shall be considered to be member contributions. No member shall have the
option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of
having them paid by the City to the fund.



      (2)   Method. Member contributions shall be made by payroll
deduction.



      (3)   Duration. Member contributions shall be deducted until a
member has reached his actual retirement date or his termination date,
whichever occurs first.



      (4)   Suspension. Should a member be suspended and
subsequently reinstated as a police officer or firefighter, he may receive
credit for the period he was under suspension by making member contributions
for such period, and shall again become a member of the system. In the event
that the reinstatement of such member is made on the basis that he is
entitled to receive full credit for the period of service prior to his date
of suspension and for the period during his suspension as though his
employment had never terminated, then the following shall apply:



         (a)   Member contributions shall be deducted from
compensation that the city is required to pay for the period of suspension.



         (b)   If the suspended member had withdrawn his
accumulated contributions, then he shall repay to the fund an amount equal to
the amount of the withdrawal and the city shall pay interest thereon, at a
rate to be determined by the board, from the date of withdrawal to the date
of repayment. These payments shall be made within ninety (90) days of the
date of reinstatement.



         (c)   Upon satisfaction of these conditions, the
suspended member shall reenter the system and receive service credit for his
credited service prior to his suspension and for the period of suspension.
During the period from the date of reinstatement to the date when the
conditions set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) above are satisfied, member
contributions shall be made in the same manner as for other members of the
system.



         (d)   In the event that such suspended member fails to
comply with subdivision (a) above, his credited service shall begin as of his
date of reinstatement and he shall forfeit all credited service prior to the
date of reinstatement.



      (5)   Transfers between employment groups. In the event that a
member of the system changes his job status with the city such that he is
considered to be in a different employment group, he shall transfer to and
become a member of the new group for purposes of the system as of the date
when the change in job status occurs. An example of a transfer between
employment groups is where a general employee becomes a police officer. In
the event of such a transfer, the member's accumulated contributions as of
the date of transfer shall remain allocable to the previous group. The
member's retirement benefit payable by the previous group shall be calculated
by using his credited service as of the date of transfer and his average
final compensation as of the date of his termination of employment or the
date of transfer, whichever amount is greater. This benefit shall be payable
commencing on the date when retirement benefits applicable to his new group
status begin. The transferred employee shall not be eligible for any other
benefits from the previous group. For purposes of determining his eligibility
for vesting, death, disability and retirement benefits as a member of the new
group, the employee's credited service prior to the date of transfer shall be
included. For the purposes of determining the amount of any vesting and
retirement benefits as a member of the new group, only service following the
date of transfer shall be included. For purposes of determining the amount of
any death or disability benefits as a member of the new group, the employee's
credited service prior to date of transfer shall be included.



   (B)   State contributions.



      (1)   Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws
of the State of Florida for the purpose of funding and paying for retirement
benefits for police officers or firefighters shall be used to provide
benefits for police officers and firefighters that are in addition to or
greater than benefits provided for general employees of the city. Additional
or greater benefits may take the form of lower retirement ages, higher
benefit accrual rates, higher disability benefits or any other type of extra
benefit. Such monies shall be deposited in the fund immediately and under no
circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. The city may
provide authorization for the direct payment to the board.



      (2)   Two separate sub-accounts shall be created within the
fund, one for the state contributions received on behalf of police officers
and one for the state contributions received on behalf of firefighters. The
monies allocable to these sub-accounts shall be invested in securities or
assets, as determined by the board, that are separate from the securities and
assets held by the main fund. The sub-accounts shall be increased by the
respective payments received from the state and by the investment earnings
attributable to the securities and assets attributable to such sub-accounts.
The sub-accounts shall be reduced by their share of administrative expenses
of the system and by all benefits paid to police officers and firefighters as
compared to general employees.



      (3)   Each year, as part of the actuarial valuation, the
system's actuary shall determine the cost of benefits provided for police
officer members and firefighter members over and above those provided for
general employees of the city. The cost of additional benefits shall be equal
to the excess of the required annual contribution for benefits of police
officer members and firefighter members over the required annual contribution
that will result if police officer members and firefighter members were
covered by the same benefits as general employees of the city. In computing
the latter amount, assets attributable to police officer members and
firefighter members shall be reduced by the sub-account attributable to each
group. The city shall take a credit against its required annual contribution
in an amount equal to the lesser of the cost of the additional benefits or
the monies received from the State of Florida for the year.



      (4)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:



         (a)   Chapter 185 funds in the amount of $380,000 in the
excess state monies reserve as of June 1, 2016 shall be used to reduce the
city's annual contributions to the fund; and Chapter 185 funds in the excess
state monies reserve as of June 1, 2016 in excess of $380,000 shall be
transferred to the Police Share Plan as provided in § 55.29.



         (b)   Annual premium tax revenues received pursuant to
Chapter 185 after June 1, 2016 shall be used as follows: annual premium tax
revenues received up to $520,734.08 shall be used to reduce the city's annual
pension contribution.  If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds
$520,734.08, fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $520,734.08 shall be
transferred to the Police Share Plan as provided in § 55.29, and the
remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the City's annual
pension contribution.



      (5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:



         (a)   Chapter 175 funds in the amount of $150,000 in the
excess state monies reserve as of October 1, 2015 shall be used to reduce the
city's annual contributions to the fund; and Chapter 175 funds in the excess
state monies reserve in the amount of $7,840 shall be transferred to the Fire
Share Plan as provided in § 55.30.



         (b)   Annual premium tax revenues received pursuant to
Chapter 175 after October 1, 2015 shall be used as follows:  annual premium
tax revenues received up to $825,324 shall be used to reduce the city's
annual pension contribution.  If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds
$825,324, fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $825,324 shall be transferred
to the Fire Share Plan as provided in § 55.30, and the remaining fifty
percent (50%) shall be used to reduce the City's annual pension contribution.



   (C)   City contributions. Each year the city shall make monthly
contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year
between the total aggregate member contributions for the year, plus state
contributions for such year, and the total cost for the year, as shown by the
most recent actuarial valuation of the system. The total cost for any year
shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount
sufficient to amortize all unfunded past service liability as provided in
Fla. Stat. Part VII of Chapter 112.



   (D)   Other. Private donations, gifts and other contributions shall
be deposited to the fund, but such deposits may be used only for additional
benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to
reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

average final compensation multiplied by his credit service in excess of
twenty (20) years, to a maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of his average
final compensation.



            4.   For police officer members who terminate city
employment on or after October 1, 2006, and retire or enter the DROP after
that date, if such member has completed more than twenty (20) years of
credited service as a police officer, in addition to the amount described in
subdivision 2. above, his monthly normal retirement benefit shall be an
amount equal to five percent (5%) of his average final compensation
multiplied by his credit service in excess of twenty (20) years, to a maximum
of one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation.



            5.   For police officer members who are hired on
or after October 1, 2016, the maximum normal retirement benefit shall be
eighty-five percent (85%) of average final compensation.



         (b)   For each firefighter member:



            1.   The normal retirement benefit for members
hired before March 15, 2012, shall be an amount equal to two percent (2%) of
his or her average final compensation multiplied by his or her credited
service prior to October 1, 1991 and two and one-half percent (2.5%) of his
or her average final compensation multiplied by his or her credited service
on and after October 1, 1991. Provided, however, that if such firefighter has
completed twenty (20) years of credited service as a firefighter, instead of
the amount described in the previous sentence, his or her monthly normal
retirement benefit shall be an amount equal to three percent (3%) of his or
her average final compensation multiplied by his or her credited service.
Provided further, however, if such firefighter has completed more than twenty
(20) years of credited service as a firefighter, in addition to the amount
described in the previous sentence, his or her monthly normal retirement
benefit shall be an amount equal to five percent (5%) of his or her average
final compensation multiplied by his or her credited service in excess of
twenty (20) years, to a maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of his or her
average final compensation upon the completion of twenty-eight (28) years of
service. 



            2.   The normal retirement benefit for members
hired on or after March 15, 2012, shall be as follows:  The benefit formula
for members with less than twenty (20) years of credited service shall be an
amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of his or her average final
compensation multiplied by his or her credited service.  The benefit formula
for members with 20 or more years of credited service shall be three and
two-tenths percent (3.2%) of average final compensation, with a maximum
benefit of ninety percent (90%) of average final compensation, excluding
supplemental benefits.



            3.   In addition, each firefighter member shall
receive a supplemental monthly retirement benefit of one hundred and
eighty-nine dollars ($189.00).  Effective October 1, 2006, this supplemental
monthly retirement benefit shall be increased to four hundred fifty eight
dollars ($458.00) and paid for by Chapter 175 excise tax monies.  This
supplemental benefit shall only be paid during the member's lifetime.



         (c)   Benefits shall commence on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following a member's retirement and shall be
payable for life but with one hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any
event. Benefits payable by the system shall be in addition to federal Social
Security benefits.



   (B)   Early retirement.



      (1)   Date.



         Early retirement date shall be the earlier of:



         (a)   The first day of the month coincident with or next
following attainment of the member's forty-fifth (45th) birthday and
completion of twenty (20) years of credited service; or



         (b)   The first day of the month coincident with the
next following attainment of the member's fiftieth (50th) birthday and
completion of ten (10) years of credited service.



      (2)   Benefit.



         For each member early retirement shall be as follows:



         (a)   A deferred monthly benefit commencing on the date
that would have been his normal retirement date had he remained in
employment, determined in the same manner as for retirement at normal
retirement date, except that credited service and average final compensation
shall be determined as of early retirement date; or



         (b)   An immediate monthly benefit commencing on his or
her early retirement date. The immediate monthly benefit shall be the
actuarial equivalent of the deferred monthly benefit but in no event shall
the immediate monthly benefit be reduced by more than three percent (3%) for
each year by which the starting date of the immediate monthly benefit
precedes the date that would have been his or her normal retirement date had
he or she remained in employment.



         (c)   In addition to either of the foregoing monthly
benefits, each firefighter member shall receive a  supplemental monthly
early retirement benefit of one hundred eighty-nine dollars ($189.00). 
Effective October 1, 2006, this supplemental monthly early retirement benefit
shall be increased to four hundred fifty-eight dollars ($458.00) and paid for
by Chapter 175 excise tax monies.  This supplemental benefit shall only be
paid during the member's lifetime.



         (d)   Benefits shall commence on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following a member's early retirement and shall
be payable for life but with one hundred and twenty (120) payments guaranteed
in any event. The monthly benefits payable by the system shall be in addition
to federal Social Security benefits.



   (C)   Supplemental Benefit for Police Officer Members.  Effective
October 1, 2006, police officer members who either terminate while vested or
reach normal retirement or early retirement shall receive a supplemental
benefit of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month for each complete year of
credited service.  This benefit shall only be paid for the life of the
member, and will not be paid to disabled members.  The benefit shall
commence upon receipt of a retirement benefit and separation from the city
and shall cease when the member attains the age of sixty-five (65).



   (D)   Supplemental Benefit for Firefighter Members.  Effective
October 1, 2007, firefighter members who either terminate while vested or
reach normal retirement or early retirement shall receive a supplemental
benefit of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month for each year of credited
service earned prior to March 15, 2012.  Effective March 15, 2012, members
who have not attained age 55 with 10 or more years of credited service or 25
years of credited service regardless of age on that date, who either
terminate while vested or terminate upon reaching normal or early retirement
shall receive a supplemental benefit of $12.00 per month for each year of
credited service earned on or after March 15, 2012.  This benefit shall only
be paid for the life of the member, and will not be paid to disabled members
who are being retained on the City's insurance at the expense of the City. 
The benefit shall commence upon entry into the DROP or upon receipt of a
retirement benefit and separation from the City.  This benefit shall cease
when the member attains the age of Medicare eligibility.

§ 55.08  DEATH.



   (A)   Post-retirement death. Upon death of a retiree there shall be
no further benefits paid, except for return of accumulated contributions not
theretofore paid in the form of retirement benefits. However, if a retiree
had elected an optional form of benefit, benefits, if any, shall be payable
in accordance with such election.



   (B)   Pre-retirement death benefits for police officer members.



      (1)   Upon the death of a member not eligible for retirement,

shall receive the return of his or her accumulated contributions.



      (2)   Upon the death of a member eligible for retirement who
had not elected an optional form of benefit, it shall be presumed that such
member had elected a monthly benefit payable for life but with one hundred
twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event and retired immediately
preceding his death; provided, however, that the resulting benefit may not be
less than the amount of member's accumulated contributions. If the deceased
member had elected an optional form of benefit, benefits, if any, shall be
payable in accordance with such election.



      (3)   Upon the death of a member having at least ten (10)
years of credited service, his beneficiary shall be entitled to the benefits
otherwise payable at the member's early or normal retirement date.



   (C)   Pre-retirement death benefits for firefighter members.



      (1)   Death in the line of duty. 



         (a)   Effective October 1, 2006, the beneficiary of any
member whose death was directly caused by performance of the member's duties
as a firefighter shall be entitled to a monthly pension benefit equal to the
greater of the member's accrued benefit or seventy-five percent (75%) of the
member's average final compensation provided that the member's death in the
line-of-duty is established to the satisfaction of the Board.



         (b)   Presumptions.



            1.   Any death of a member caused by hypertension
or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line-of-duty
unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; provided that such member
shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such
service, including a cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any
evidence of such condition.



            2.   The presumptions regarding certain
communicable diseases provided for in Fla. Stat. 112.181, as amended from
time to time, shall apply only to those conditions described in that statute
that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996.



      (2)   Death not in the line-of-duty.  Effective October 1,
2006, the beneficiary of any member, with at least ten (10) years of credited
service, whose death was not directly caused by the performance of the
member's duties as a firefighter shall be entitled to a monthly pension
benefit equal to the greater of the member's accrued benefit or twenty-five
percent (25%) of the member's average final compensation.



      (3)   Upon the death of a member eligible for retirement who
had not elected an optional form of benefit, it shall be presumed that such
member had elected a monthly benefit payable for life but with one hundred
twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event and retired immediately
preceding his death; provided, however, that the resulting benefit may not be
less than the amount of member's accumulated contributions.  If the deceased
member had elected an optional form of benefit, the benefits, if any, shall
be payable in accordance with such election.



      (4)   Upon written request to the Board made within a time
frame established by the Board, a beneficiary entitled to receive benefits
under this subsection (C) shall have the option of receiving the return of
the deceased member's accumulated contributions.



   (D)   Death during qualified military service.  In the case of a
death or disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a member dies
while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of
the Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the member are entitled to any
additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of
qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the member had
resumed and then terminated employment by the City on account of death.

§ 55.09  DISABILITY.



   (A)   Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall
become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he or she is
unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,
to render useful and efficient service as a police officer or firefighter,
which disability was directly caused by the performance of his or her duty as
a police officer or firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the
satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension as follows:



      (1)   Firefighters hired before March 15, 2012, and police
officers shall be entitled to a monthly pension equal to the member's accrued
benefit, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to such member shall be
seventy-five percent (75%) of the member's average final compensation.



      (2)   Firefighter members hired on or after March 15, 2012,
shall be entitled to a monthly pension equal to the member's accrued benefit,
but in any event, the minimum amount paid to such member shall be sixty-six
percent (66%) of the member's average final compensation.



   (B)   In-line-of-duty presumption:



      (1)   Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a
member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been
suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence;
provided, that such member shall have successfully passed a physical
examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which
examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition.



      (2)   Additional presumption. The presumption provided for
certain communicable diseases in Fla. Stat. § 112.181, as amended from time
to time, shall apply only to those conditions described in that statute that
are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996.



   (C)   Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten
(10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently
disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically
determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient
service as a police officer or firefighter, which disability is not directly
caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer or firefighter,
shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be
entitled to a monthly pension equal to his accrued benefit, but in any event
the minimum amount paid to such member shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of
average final compensation.



   (D)   Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who
is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the
board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by:



      (1)   Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or
alcohol narcotics.



      (2)   Injury or disease sustained while willfully and
illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections, or while
committing a crime.



      (3)   Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch
of the armed forces.



      (4)   Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a
police officer or firefighter shall have terminated.



      (5)   Injury or disease sustained by the member while working
for anyone other than the city and arising out of such other employment.



   (E)   Physical examination requirement. A member shall not be
eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical
examination by one or more qualified physicians who shall be selected by the
board for that purpose.



      (1)   Any retiree receiving disability benefits hereunder may
be periodically re-examined by one or more qualified physicians who shall be
selected by the board to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If
the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally
disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient
service as a police officer or firefighter, the board shall recommend to the
city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer
or firefighter. In the event a retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to
comply with the order within thirty (30) days, or upon regaining
certification where required and as herein provided, he shall forfeit the
right to his disability pension. If recertification is required, then prior
to returning to duty it shall be the responsibility of the retiree to begin,
within thirty (30) days, to regain his certification as a police officer or
firefighter, if he has lost such certification during his disability period.
In such event, he shall return to work immediately after such recertification.



      (2)   The cost of the physical examination or re-examination
of a member or retiree shall be borne by the fund. Any other reasonable costs
as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but
not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, may be borne
by the fund.



      (3)   If a retiree recovers from disability and re-enters the
service of the city as a police officer or firefighter, his service will be
deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month
for which he received a disability pension payment and ending with the date
he re-entered the service of the city will not be considered as credited
service for the purposes of the system.



      (4)   The board shall have the power and authority to make the
final decisions regarding all disability or recovery claims.



   (F)   Duration of disability payments. The monthly benefit to which
a member is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be
payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such
entitlement. However, the monthly benefit shall be payable as of the date the
board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month
shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be:



      (1)   If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment
due next preceding the date of such recovery; or



      (2)   If the retiree dies without recovering from disability,
the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment,
whichever is later.



      (3)   Provided, however, a disability retiree may select, at
any time prior to the date on which disability benefit payments begin, an
optional form of benefit payment as described below.

§ 55.10  VESTING.



   (A)   If a member terminates his employment as a police officer or
firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any
other benefits under the system, the member shall be entitled to benefits
determined pursuant to the following schedule:

hereunder, but who has a vested interest at time of termination, shall
receive monthly benefits commencing on the date that would have been his
normal retirement date had he remained in employment. Alternatively, such
member may elect to receive his vested benefit, reduced for early retirement,
at any time on or after the date that would have been his early retirement
date, it being further understood that actuarially equivalent amounts shall
be payable under any form or manner of payment provided.



(Ord. 2000-15, passed 5-5-00; Am. Ord. 2013-45, passed 8-13-13)



§ 55.11  OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFITS.



   (A)   In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable as
specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to
receive a retirement income or benefit of actuarial equivalence, payable in
accordance with one of the following options:



      (1)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree for his
lifetime only.



      (2)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree for life but
with one hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event.



      (3)   A monthly benefit payable to the retiree during his
lifetime and following his death, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five
percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-%) or fifty percent (50%)
of such monthly amount, payable for the beneficiary's lifetime. In no event,
however, shall the present value of payments to the retiree be less than
fifty percent (50%) of the total present value of payments to the retiree and
his beneficiary.



      (4)   If a member retires prior to the time at which Social
Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased monthly
benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to
commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an
extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire
period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the
actuary for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the
time of the member's retirement.



   (B)   A member who elects any option in this section shall designate
the beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in
the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such
designation up to two (2) times without approval of the Board or the current
joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retired member need not provide proof of
the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree need not
provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being
removed and the joint annuitant or beneficiary need not be living. Such
designation shall name one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable.



   (C)   The consent of a member's or retiree's beneficiary to change
thereof shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated
beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall thereupon
forever cease.



   (D)   Any retired member who desires to change his or her
beneficiary shall file with the Board a notarized notice of such change
either by registered letter or on such form as is provided by the Board.



   (E)   Upon change of a retiree's beneficiary in accordance herewith,
the amount of the monthly benefit payable to the retiree shall be actuarially
recalculated to take into account the age and sex of the former beneficiary,
of the new beneficiary and of the retiree. Any such retiree shall pay the
actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of
previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculation. In the
event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as
may be payable in the event of the death of the retiree shall be paid as
provided in § 55.12.



   (F)   Monthly benefits shall be made under the option elected and
shall be subject to the following limitations:



      (1)   If a member dies prior to his early retirement date, no
retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the
benefits, if any, will be determined under § 55.08.



      (2)   If the designated beneficiary dies before the member
retires, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a monthly
benefit in the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his
retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is
made or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement.



      (3)   If both the retiree and all beneficiaries designated by
the member or retiree die before the full payment has been made under any
option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, the
board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining
payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with § 55.12.



      (4)   If a member continues employment beyond his normal
retirement date and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option
is in effect, monthly benefits shall be paid under said option to the
beneficiary or beneficiaries in an amount as if the member had retired under
said option on the date on which his death occurred.



   (G)   A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date
of cashing or depositing his first benefit check.



   (H)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board, in
its discretion, may elect to make a lump-sum payment to a member or a
member's beneficiary in the event that the monthly benefit amount is less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or the total commuted value of the
remaining monthly benefits to be paid do not exceed five thousand dollars
($5,000.00). Any such payment made pursuant hereto shall operate as a
complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such
member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final,
binding and conclusive on all persons.

§ 55.12  BENEFICIARIES.



   (A)   Each member or retiree shall, on a form provided for that
purpose, signed and filed with the Board, designate a beneficiary to receive
the benefit, if any, that may be payable in the event of his or her death.
Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by
signing and filing with the Board a new designation form. Upon such change,
the rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits
under the system shall forever cease.



   (B)   If a deceased member or retiree duly failed to name a
beneficiary or if all beneficiaries so named predecease the member or
retiree, the death benefit, if any, that may be payable under the system with
respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the
member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the
commuted value of the remaining monthly benefits be paid in a lump sum.



   (C)   Any such payment hereto shall operate as a complete discharge
of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and any other
persons with rights under the system, and shall not be subject to review by
anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

utilized in processing written requests on matters which affect the
substantial rights of any person, including members, retirees, beneficiaries
or any person affected by a decision of the Board.



   (B)   The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the
attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior
to and at any proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. A
reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas, not to
exceed the maximum fee provided by law.

   The secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons receiving
pensions under the system in which it shall be noted the time when the

§ 55.16  MAXIMUM PENSION.



   Notwithstanding any other provision of the system to the contrary, the
annual benefit to which a member is entitled under the system shall not, in
any limitation year, be in amount which would exceed the applicable
limitations under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and the
regulations issued thereunder.  If the benefit payable under the system
would (but for this section) exceed the limitations of Section 415 of the
Code by reason of a benefit payable under another defined benefit plan
aggregated with this system under Code Section 415(f), the benefit under this
system shall be reduced only after all reductions have been made under such
other plan.  As of January 1 of each calendar year commencing on or after
January 1, 2007, the dollar limitation as determined by the Commissioner of
the Internal Revenue Service for that calendar year shall become effective as
the maximum permissible dollar amount of benefit payable under the system
during the limitation year ending within that calendar year.

§ 55.17  MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS.



   (A)   General rules.



      (1)   Effective date.  The provisions of this section will
apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar
years beginning with the 2007 calendar year.



      (2)   Precedence.  The requirements of this section will take
precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the system.



      (3)   Requirements of treasury regulations incorporated.  All
distributions required under this section will be determined and made in
accordance with the Treasury regulations under section 401(a)(9) of the Code.



      (4)   TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the
other provisions of this Section other than this subsection (A)(4),
distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in
accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2)
of TEFRA.



   (B)   Time and manner of distribution.



      (1)   Required beginning date.  The member's entire interest
will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than
the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of
the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the
member attains age seventy and one-half (70 ½) or the calendar year in which
the member retires unless otherwise provided for in the Plan or required by
law.



      (2)   Death of member before distributions begin.  If the
member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be
distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows:



         (a)   If the member's surviving spouse is the member's
sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will
begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in
which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (70 ½), if
later.



         (b)   If the member's surviving spouse is not the
member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated
beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year in which the member died.



         (c)   If there is no designated beneficiary as of
September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the
member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar
year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.



         (d)   If the member's surviving spouse is the member's
sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member
but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection
(B)(2), other than subsection (B)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving
spouse were the member.



      For purposes of this subsection (B)(2) and subsection (E),
distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date
or, if subsection (B)(2)(d) applies, the date of distributions are required
to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)(a).  If annuity
payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required
beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date
distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection
(B)(2)(a), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date
distributions actually commence.



      (3)   Form of distribution.  Unless the member's interest is
distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or
in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first
distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with
subsections (C), (D), and (E) of this section.  If the member's interest is
distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of
Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations.  Any part of the
Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in
Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the
requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that
apply to individual accounts.



   (C)   Determination of amount to be distributed each year.



      (1)   General annuity requirements.  If the member's interest
is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under
the annuity will satisfy the following requirements:



         (a)   The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic
payments made at intervals not longer than one year.



         (b)   The distribution period will be over a life (or
lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period described in
subsection (D) or (E).



         (c)   Once payments have begun over a period certain,
the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter
than the maximum permitted.



         (d)   Payments will either be non-increasing or increase
only as follows:



            1.   By an annual percentage increase that does
not exceed the cumulative annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living
index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics or by a fixed annual increase of five percent or less.



            2.   To the extent of the reduction in the amount
of the member's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but
only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the
distribution period described in subsection (D) dies or is no longer the
member's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within
the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code.



            3.   To provide cash refunds of accumulated
contributions upon the member's death.



            4.   To pay increased benefits that result from a
system amendment.



      (2)   Amount required to be distributed by required beginning
date.  The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's
required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin,
the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (B)(2)(a) or
(B)(2)(b) is the payment that is required for one payment interval.  The
second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval
even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year.  Payment
intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly,
monthly, semi-annually, or annually.  All of the member's benefit accruals
as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included
in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment
intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date.



      (3)   Additional accruals after first distribution calendar
year.  Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year
after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with
the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following
the calendar year in which such amount accrues.



   (D)   Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during a
member's lifetime.



      (1)   Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the
member's spouse.  If the member's interest is being distributed in the form
of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a
nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's
required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's
death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity
payment for such period that would have been payable to the member using the
table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury
regulations.  If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor
annuity for the joint lives of the member and a non-spouse beneficiary and a
period certain annuity, the requirements in the preceding sentence will apply
to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the
expiration of the period certain.



      (2)   Period certain annuities. Unless the member's spouse is
the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period
certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution
commencing during the member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable
distribution period for the member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth
in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year
that contains the annuity starting date.  If the annuity starting date
precedes the year in which the member reaches age seventy (70), the
applicable distribution period for the member is the distribution period for
age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70)
over the age of the member as of the member's birthday in the year that
contains the annuity starting date.  If the member's spouse is the member's
sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain
and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the
member's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subsection
(D)(2), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the
member's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set
forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the
member's and spouse's attained ages as of the member's and spouse's birthdays
in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.



   (E)   Requirements for minimum distributions where member dies
before date distributions begin.



      (1)   Member survived by designated beneficiary.  If the
member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and
there is a designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest will be
distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subsection
(B)(2)(a) or (B)(2)(b), over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a
period certain not exceeding:



         (a)   Unless the annuity starting date is before the
first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated
beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's
birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the
member's death.



         (b)   If the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary
determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in
the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.



      (2)   No designated beneficiary.  If the member dies before
the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of
September 30th of the year following the year of the member's death,
distribution of the member's entire interest will be completed by December
31st of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's
death.



      (3)   Death of surviving spouse before distributions to
surviving spouse begin.  If the member dies before the date distribution of
his or her interest begins, the member's surviving spouse is the member's
sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before
distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection will apply as if
the surviving spouse were the member, except that the time by which
distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Subsection
(B)(2)(a).



   (F)   Definitions.



      (1)   Designated beneficiary.  The individual who is
designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated
beneficiary under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1,
Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.



      (2)   Distribution calendar year.  A calendar year for which
a minimum distribution is required.  For distributions beginning before the
member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year
immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required
beginning date.  For distributions beginning after the member's death, the
first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions
are required to begin pursuant to Subsection (B)(2).



      (3)   Life expectancy.  Life expectancy as computed by use of
the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.

Subsection (B)(1).

times comply with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code, Section 401(a)(9),
and the regulations issued thereunder.

§ 55.18  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Interest of members in system. At no time prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and
members and their spouses or beneficiaries shall any part of the corpus or
income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for
their exclusive benefit.



   (B)   No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance
shall be adopted by the city that shall have the effect of reducing the
then-vested accrued benefits of any member or any member's beneficiaries.



   (C)   Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will
constitute a qualified pension plan under the applicable provisions of the
code, as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of
the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify
or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable
provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other
applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or
hereafter amended or adopted and the regulations issued thereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, the system is declared to be an irrevocable plan and trust,
subject to the city's right to terminate in accordance with law.



   (D)   Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of
service of members shall serve only to reduce current or future contributions
to the fund.



   (E)   Correction of records. Should any change or error in records
result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less
than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct,
then on discovery of any such error the board shall cause the same to be
corrected and as far as practicable shall direct that the payments be
adjusted in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which
the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.



   (F)   USSERA. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan to the
contrary, effective as of December 12, 1994, contributions, benefits and
service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in
accordance with Section 414(u) of the IRC, USSERA  and FLA. Stat. Chapters
175 and 185.



   (G)   Differential Wage Payments. For Plan Years beginning after
December 31, 2008: (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment,
as defined by IRC section 3401(h)(2), is treated as a Member of the System;
(ii) the differential wage payment is treated as Compensation for purposes of
IRC section 415(c)(3) and Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2; and (iii)
the System is not treated as failing to meet the requirements of any
provision described in IRC Section 414(u)(1)(C) (or corresponding System
provisions) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the
differential wage payment.



   (H)   Notwithstanding any provision in this Part to the contrary
members eligible for an unreduced normal retirement benefit may receive an
in-service distribution provided any such distribution complies with the
applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations
and guidance issued by the Internal Revenue service with respect to
in-service distributions. This provision is applicable only to members who
were eligible to commence normal retirement benefits during the period from
April 1, 2004 to November 30, 2011.



      (1)   Members may elect to cease in-service distributions, at
any time.  A member who ceases in-service distributions may restart
participation in this Plan, to the extent they otherwise qualify under the
terms of this Plan.  Contributions must continue upon the member's re-entry
in this Plan, in accordance with § 55.06 here.



      (2)   A member who ceases in-service distributions and
restarts participation in this Plan may receive credited service for their
period of in-service distribution, in each case, if and only if, upon their
re-entry into this Plan, the value of Contributions for such period of
in-service distributions are deducted from the member's retirement allowance
and benefit, in accordance with each other requirement for credited service
herein.



      (3)   In accordance with the intent of Section
1.401-l(b)(l)(i) of the Treasury Regulations, in no event shall a member be
permitted to restart participation in this Retirement Plan, under this §
55.18(H), greater than one time.



      (4)   At the time of a member's Retirement, when he or she
ceases active membership and severs employment with the City, such member's
Retirement allowance and benefit, determined in each case in accordance with
the provisions herein, shall be reduced by the actuarially equivalent value
of the in-service distribution.



      (5)   In the event that the in-service distributions of any
member must cease in order to maintain the tax-qualified status of this Plan,
then those members whose in-service distributions cease will be returned to
active membership in the Plan with prior service credit for all years in
which distributions were received, provided the member pays to the Plan the
required employee contributions, without interest, which would have been paid
had the member not commenced in-service distributions; provided, however, if
such member fails to pay the required employee contributions in the time and
manner determined by the Board of Trustees, such member shall not receive
prior service credit for the years in which in-service distributions were
received. To the extent required in order to maintain the tax-qualified
status of the Plan, the Plan shall recoup a member's prior in-service
distributions from the affected member's future benefit payments following
such member's separation from the City, upon the affected member's separation
from the City, the member's benefit payments (which shall take into account
all of the member's credited service) shall be reduced by the pro-rata
monthly share of the amount to be recouped based on the member's life
expectancy utilizing the mortality table in effect at the time benefits
recommence.

§ 55.19  REPEAL OR TERMINATION OF SYSTEM.



   (A)   Upon termination of the system by the city for any reason or
because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units,
services, or functions as provided in fla. Stat. Chapter 121, or upon written
notice by the city to the Board that contributions under the system are being
permanently discontinued, the rights of all members to benefits accrued to
the date of such termination and the amounts credited to the members’
accounts are non-forfeitable. The fund shall be distributed in accordance
with the following procedures:



      (1)   The Board shall determine the date of distribution and
the asset value required to fund all the non-forfeitable benefits after
taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform
the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall
continue to financially support the system until all non-forfeitable benefits
have been funded.



      (2)   The Board shall determine the method of distribution of
the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the
maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured
annuities, or otherwise, for each member entitled to benefits under the
system as specified in paragraph (3).



      (3) The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of
termination in the manner set forth in this paragraph, on the basis that the
amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially
computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the
method of distribution determined under paragraph (2) involves the purchase
of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement
income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial
single-sum value may not be less than the member’s accumulated
contributions to the system, with interest if provided by the system, less
the value of any system benefits previously paid to the member.



      (4)   If there is asset value remaining after the full
distribution specified in paragraph (3), and after the payment of any
expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to
the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided
that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and
the state to date of termination of the system, such excess shall be divided
proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state.



      (5)   The Board shall distribute, in accordance with paragraph
(2), the amounts determined under paragraph (3).



   If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the system terminated
or the date the Board received written notice that the contributions
thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the Board of the
system’s pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the
provisions in this section, the Department of Management Services shall
effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

whatsoever, and shall be unassignable.

shall hereafter be granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally
for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct
the pension amount of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or
existing law or hereafter granted a pension under the system if the same is
found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason, and to
reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law been
or who shall hereafter under the system be erroneously, improperly or
illegally classified. Any overpayments or underpayments shall be corrected
and paid or repaid in a reasonable manner determined by the board.

§ 55.24  DIRECT TRANSFERS OF ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS.



   (A)   This section applies to distributions made on or after January
1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board,
to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.



   (B)   Retiree medical premiums for public safety officers. The
System may allow a public safety officer to elect a tax free distribution of
up to $3,000 annually directly to a retiree medical plan or long term care
insurance on a pre-tax basis, so long as the public safety officer separates
from service either at the plan's normal retirement age or due to his or her
disability.  Insurance premiums may be paid for the public safety officer,
his spouse, or his dependents while he is alive, but once he is deceased, the
benefit ceases and may not be used by his spouse or beneficiaries to pay for
their insurance premiums.  Insurance premium payments may only be made



directly to the insurance company.  "Public safety officers" include law
enforcement officers, firefighters, chaplains, rescue crew members or
ambulance crew members.



   (C)   Definitions:



      (1)   ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION. An eligible rollover
distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does
not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or
life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a
specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent
such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the
portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.



      (2)   ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN. An eligible retirement plan is
an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the code, an
individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the code, an
annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the code, or a qualified trust
described in Section 401(a) of the code that accepts the distributee's
eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover
distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an
individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall
also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the code and an
eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a
state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of
a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan.



      (3)   DISTRIBUTEE . A distributee includes an employee or
former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective
as of January 1, 2008, an employee's or former employee's non-spouse
beneficiary is a distributee with regard to the interest of the employee or
former employee.



      (4)   DIRECT ROLLOVER. A direct rollover is a payment by the
plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Effective
as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover
only to an “inherited” individual retirement account as described in
Section 408(b) of the code.



   (D)   IRS compliance.  If a police officer member is no longer
employed by the City of Palm Bay Police Department and the member's plan
account is greater than $1,000 but not greater than $5,000, the plan
administrator may deposit the money into an IRA in the member's name if they
do not elect to receive or roll it over. If a police officer member's account
contains $1,000 or less, the plan administrator may pay it to the member,
less, in most cases, 20% income tax withholding, with or without member
consent. Members may still rollover the distribution within sixty (60) days.
Member contributions can remain in the plan for up to 5 (five) years in
accordance with the provisions set forth in the definition of "Credited
Service" under § 55.02. This provision only applies to police officer
members.

alike character and with like aims; and



      (3)   By performing their duties in accordance with the
documents and instruments setting forth and governing the system.

§ 55.26  INDEMNIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.



   (A)   To the extent not covered by insurance contracts in force from
time to time, the city shall indemnify and hold harmless members of the board
from all personal liability for damages and costs, including court costs and
attorneys' fees, arising out of claims, suits, litigation or threat of same,
herein referred to as "claims," against such individuals because of acts or
circumstances connected with or arising out of their official duties as
members of the board. The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
settle or not settle the claim at any time and to appeal or to not appeal
from any adverse judgment or ruling, and in either event will indemnify and
hold harmless any members of the board from the judgment, execution or levy
thereon.



   (B)   This section shall not be construed so as to relieve any
insurance company or other entity liable to defend the claim or liable for
payment of the judgment or claim from any liability, nor does this section
waive any provision of law affording the city, the board or the trustees
immunity from any suit in whole or part, or waive any other substantive or
procedural rights they may have.



   (C)   This section shall not apply to claims arising out of acts or
omissions of members of the board that constitute felonies or gross
malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office.

firefighter member must have been a retiree for at least six (6) years as of
an adjustment date.  However, a cost-of-living adjustment shall be paid on a
pro-rata basis for any fractional year in excess of six (6) years as of an
adjustment date.



      (3)   For purposes of determining eligibility of a beneficiary
for a cost of living adjustment hereunder, the firefighter member's date of
retirement shall govern.

      (1)   Eligibility to participate.  In lieu of terminating his
employment as a police officer or firefighter, any police officer or
firefighter actively employed by the city who is or has been eligible for
normal retirement, may elect to participate in the DROP.



      (2)   Election to participate. A police officer  or
firefighter's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in
a time and manner determined by the Board and shall be effective on the first
day of the first calendar month following the Board's acceptance of such
notification. 



      (3)   Period of participation.  No police officer or
firefighter shall participate in the DROP for more than sixty (60) months.



      (4)   Termination of participation.



         (a)   A police officer or firefighter shall cease DROP
participation by



            1.   terminating employment with the city.



            2.   participating in the DROP for 60 months.



         (b)   Upon termination of participation in the DROP,
amounts shall cease to be transferred from the Retirement System to the
police officer or firefighter DROP Account, and shall be disbursed in the
normal manner for retirement benefits.  Any amounts remaining in his DROP
Account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of division
(C) of this section when he terminates employment with the city.



         (c)   A police officer or firefighter who terminates his
participation in the DROP under division (A)(4) of this section shall not be
permitted to again become a participant of the Retirement System or DROP.



      (5)   Effect of DROP Participation on the Retirement System.



         (a)   A police officer or firefighter's Credited Service
and accrued benefit under the Retirement System shall be determined on the
date his election to participate in the DROP becomes effective.  A police
officer or firefighter shall not accrue any additional Credited Service or
additional benefits under the Retirement System (except for any benefits
provided under any cost of living adjustments in the Retirement System) while
he is a participant of the DROP.



         (b)   No amounts shall be paid to a police officer or
firefighter from the Retirement System while a police officer or firefighter
is a participant in the DROP.  Unless otherwise specified in the Retirement
System and/or DROP provisions, if a police officer or firefighter terminates
his or her participation in the DROP other than terminating his or her
employment with the city, no amounts shall be paid to him or her from the
Retirement System until he or she terminates his or her employment with the
city. 



            1.   Unless otherwise provided for within the
Retirement System or DROP  provisions, amounts transferred to the
firefighter member DROP Account shall be paid directly to the firefighter
member only on or after the earliest date after the quarterly interest
posting and declaration of interest, net of fees by the Board for the quarter
following the firefighter member's termination of employment with the city.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon request of the
firefighter member, the Board, based upon  performance of the plan during
the then-current quarter, may make payment directly to the firefighter member
of up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount in the firefighter member's
DROP Account on or as soon as practical after the firefighter member's
termination of employment with the city. The balance, if any, shall be paid
directly to the  firefighter member after the quarterly interest posting and
declaration of interest, net of fees, by the Board for the quarter following
the firefighter member's termination of employment  with the city. If it is
subsequently determined by the Board that the firefighter member has  been
overpaid, the firefighter member shall forthwith repay the Board the amount
of such overpayment, plus interest and the Board may withhold from future
benefit payments to the firefighter member the amount of any such
overpayment, plus interest.



            2.   Unless otherwise provided for within the
Retirement System or DROP provisions, amounts transferred to the police
officer's DROP Account shall be paid directly to the police officer only on
or after the earliest date after the quarterly interest posting and
declaration of interest, net of fees by the Board for that quarter following
the police officer's termination of employment with the city.



         (c)   Participant's contributions to the Retirement
System cease on effective date of DROP participation.



         (d)   In the event of death of a DROP participant, DROP
participation ceases.  Retirement benefit is paid according to the form of
benefit chosen upon election to participate in the DROP, and Drop Account
becomes payable at that time.



   (B)   Funding.



      (1)   Establishment of DROP account.  A DROP account shall be
established for each police officer or firefighter participating in the
DROP. 



      A police officer or firefighter's DROP account shall consist of:



         (a)   amounts transferred to the DROP under division
(B)(2), and



         (b)   investment earnings or losses on those amounts.



Such amounts will not be segregated or invested separate from the System, but
accounted for separately.



      (2)   Transfers from retirement system.



         (a)   As of the first day of each month of a police
officer or firefighter's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly
retirement benefit he would have received under the Retirement System had he
terminated his employment as a police officer or firefighter and elected to
receive monthly benefit payments there under shall be transferred to his DROP
Account.  A police officer or firefighter's period of participation in the
DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of division (A) of
this section, but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates
employment with the city.



         (b)   Amounts credited to a police officer or
firefighter's DROP Account under division (B)(2)(a) of this section shall be
credited monthly.



         (c)   Investment earnings or losses shall be credited or
debited quarterly to a police officer or firefighter's DROP Account with the
quarterly net investment return, net of money manager fees and other
expenses, determined by the Board on the assets of the Retirement System. 
Individuals entering the DROP during a quarter would have investment earnings
or losses, net of money manager fees and other expenses, determined by the
Board on the assets of the Retirement System for the specific number of
months the funds were considered in the DROP during that quarter; however,
interest would be posted at quarter-end.



   (C)   Distribution of DROP Account Funds on termination of
employment.



      (1)   Eligibility for benefits.  A police officer or
firefighter shall receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with
the provisions of this section upon his termination of employment as a police
officer or firefighter.  Except as provided in division (C)(4) of this
section, no amounts shall be paid to a police officer or firefighter from the
DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer or
firefighter.  Should the police officer or firefighter elect any combination
of the forms of distribution, the rollover and/or lump sum portions of the
DROP account shall be deducted from the balance prior to the calculation of
annual installment amount.



      (2)   Forms of distribution.



         (a)   Annual installments.  The amount of the annual
installment shall be fixed upon termination from employment as a police
officer or firefighter, and shall be no less than 10% (1/10th) or $10,000,
whichever is greater, of the balance of the member's DROP account at the time
of termination.  Annual installments shall be distributed each December and
continue until either the member's DROP account is depleted, or the member
chooses a Rollover or Lump Sum distribution, as listed below.



         (b)   Rollover.  The balance or any portion of the
balance of a member's DROP account may be rolled over to another qualified
retirement plan.



         (c)   Lump sum.  The balance or any portion of the
balance of a member's DROP account may be paid directly to the member.



         (d)   In the event that a police officer or firefighter
dies before total distribution of his DROP account, the balance in his DROP
account shall be paid in an immediate lump sum to his beneficiary.



      (3)   Date of payment of distribution.



         (a)   Distribution of a police officer or firefighter's
DROP Account shall begin as soon as administratively practicable following
the police officer or firefighter's termination of employment as a police
officer or firefighter in accordance with divisions (A)(5)(b) and (C)(2)(a)
through (d) of this section.



         (b)   Any amounts in the DROP Account of a police
officer or firefighter who terminated his participation in the DROP in
accordance with division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section by terminating his
employment as a police officer or firefighter shall continue to be invested
as part of the DROP's funds and shall be credited or debited with the net
investment on those funds in accordance with division (B)(2)(c) of this
section until such amounts are distributed to the police officer or
firefighter or his beneficiary.



      (4)   Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other
person.  The Board may require and rely upon such proof of death and
evidence of the right of any beneficiary or any other person to receive the
value of a deceased police officer or firefighter's DROP Account as the Board
may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or
other person to receive payment shall be conclusive.



   (D)   Administration of the DROP.



      (1)   Board responsibilities.  The general administration of
the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and
the responsibility for overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall
be placed with the Board.  However, DROP assets will not be segregated or
invested separate from the system's assets.  The Board may adopt such
administrative procedures and regulations as it deems desirable for the
conduct of its affairs; may authorize one or more of its number or any agent
to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on its behalf; may
retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting,
actuarial and consulting services as it may require in carrying out the
provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among its members or delegate to
other persons all or such portion of its duties under the DROP, other than
those granted to the Board as a trustee under any trust agreement adopted for
use in implementing the DROP, as it, in its sole discretion shall decide. 



      (2)   Individual accounts, records, and reports.  The Board
shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and
condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in
each police officer or firefighter's DROP account, and the Board shall keep,
or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the
valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP.  The Board shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to each police officer or
firefighter participating in the DROP and shall file with the appropriate
governmental agencies, all necessary descriptions, reports, information
returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant
to the Internal Revenue Service Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act and any other applicable laws.



      (3)   Establishment of rules.  Subject to the limitations of
the DROP, the Board from time to time shall establish rules for the
administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business.  The Board
shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP
(including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility
for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the
DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the
DROP).  The determination of the Board as to the interpretation of the DROP
or its determination of any disputed question shall be conclusive and final
to the extent permitted by applicable law. 



      (4)   Limitation of liability.



         (a)   The members of the Board shall not incur any
liability individually or on behalf of anyother individuals for any act or
failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of
the DROP.



         (b)   Neither the Board nor any member of the Board
shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or
employed by the Board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as
on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions
of counsel.  The Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action
taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert,
accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such
reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP.



   (E)   General provisions.



      (1)   Amendment of DROP.  The Board reserves the right at any
time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary and if
permissible, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the
DROP.  However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make
it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to,
purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits
under the DROP.  No amendment to this section shall be made which has the
effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any police officer or
firefighter.



      (2)   Facility of payment.  If a police officer or
firefighter or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP has a duly
appointed legal representative, payment shall be made to such legal
representative in complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that
benefit.



      (3)   Information.  Each police officer or firefighter,
beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall
be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board

determined by the Board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees
similarly situated.  The Board reserves the right to change from time to
time the time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations
by police officers or firefighters under the DROP if it determines after due
deliberations that such action is justified in that it improves the
administration of the DROP.  In the event of a conflict between the
provisions for making and election, notification or designation set forth in
the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative
procedures shall prevail.



         (b)   Each police officer or firefighter or former
police officer or firefighter who has a DROP account shall be responsible for
furnishing the Board with his current address, along with any financial
institution information required by the Board to facilitate direct transfers

firefighter or former police officer or firefighter hereunder shall be deemed
given if directed to him at the last such address given to the Board and
mailed by registered or certified United States mail.  If any such
correspondence or funds transfer is returned, future disbursement of funds
shall be suspended until such time as the police officer or firefighter or
former police officer or firefighter notifies the Board of his address and
financial institution information.



      (5)   Benefits not guaranteed.  All benefits payable under
the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the DROP and neither the city
nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any
funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by applicable
law.  A positive or negative quarterly earnings may occur throughout DROP
participation and the distribution period.  The principal balance could be
reduced due to lowered market investment returns while in the DROP.



      (6)   Administrative expenses.  The Board may pay the
reasonable and necessary expense of administering the DROP, including, but
not limited to, expenses incurred in connection with investing theDROP's
assets, from the funds of the system to the extent that they are not
otherwise paid by the city.



      (7)   Construction.



         (a)   The DROP shall be construed, regulated and
administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law
controls.



         (b)   The masculine pronoun shall mean the feminine
wherever appropriate.



         (c)   The titles and heading of the articles and
sections in this Plan are for convenience only.  In the case of ambiguity or
inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control.



      (8)   Forfeiture of retirement benefits.  Nothing in this
section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application
of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the System.  DROP participants
shall be subject to the forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP
benefits.



      (9)   Code Section 414(k) and Code Section 415.  To the
extent that the DROP is treated as a defined contribution plan under Section
414(k) of the Code, the amounts transferred to the participant's DROP account
under section 55.28(B)(2) above and any other annual additions to the
participant's DROP account shall not exceed the applicable limit under
Section 415(c) of the Code.  For purposes of the application of the
applicable limit under Section 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the term
"participant's compensation" shall mean the participant's compensation and
earnings from the City and the term "annual additions" shall have the meaning
given under Section 415(c)(2) and Income Tax Regulations Section
1.415(c)-1.  To the extent that the annual additions to a participant's DROP
account for any year exceed the applicable limit under Section 415(c), the
City shall correct such excess contribution in accordance with IRS Revenue
Procedure 2008-50 and any successor procedure issued by the IRS.

§ 55.29  POLICE SHARE PLAN.



   (A)   Share Plan established. The Palm Bay Police Share Plan
(hereinafter "Police Share Plan") is hereby established as of October 1,
2016. The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of F.S.
Chapter 185 and to provide a mechanism to pay required "special benefits"
pursuant to F.S. § 185.35. The Police Share Plan shall be funded exclusively
with available premium tax revenues received from the State of Florida
pursuant to Chapter 185 and shall be in addition to the monthly defined
benefit payable by the under the system. "Available premium tax revenues"
means the amount in excess of $380,000 in the excess state monies reserve as
of June 1, 2016 as provided in subsection (b) below, and the annual amount of
Chapter 185 premium tax revenues in excess of $520,734.08 as provided in
subsection (c) below.  The Police Share Plan shall be administered by the
Board.



   (B)   Creation of share accounts and initial contribution. The
Police Share Plan shall be initially funded with the sum of $6,474.59,
representing unallocated Chapter 185 funds in the excess state monies reserve
as of June 1, 2016 in excess of $380,000. Effective October 1, 2016, for
accounting purposes, an individual share account shall be established for
each active police officer member, including DROP participants. An eligible
active "member" is defined as a police officer who is currently making
contributions to the System, on military leave, or participating in the DROP.
The initial allocation of the excess state monies reserve shall be made to
the share accounts of eligible members based on each eligible member's number
of shares. A "share" is defined as one (1) full month of credited service in
the System as identified by the Board. (Example: one (1) month of credited
service is equal to one (1) share; one (1) year of credited service is equal
to twelve (12) shares.) The Police Share Plan shall account for each member's
share account balance as provided herein.



   (C)   Annual determination. Each year, after receipt of the annual
distribution of Chapter 185 money from the State, the Board, in consultation
with their actuary, shall determine the amount of available premium tax
revenue, if any, received pursuant to F.S. § 185.35. Premium tax revenue is
not available for payment into the Police Share Plan unless the annual
premium tax distribution exceeds $520,734.08 (hereinafter the "special
benefit threshold"). If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds the
special benefit threshold, fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $520,734.08
shall be paid into the Police Share Plan. The remaining fifty percent (50%)
shall be used to reduce the City's annual pension contribution. In future
years in which there are available funds, each member on September 30th of
each year shall receive shares of the available funds received during the
fiscal year, less administrative expenses, as follows:



      (1)   Annually the Board will calculate the number of shares
earned by each active member of the Police Share Plan.



      (2)   Annually, the Board shall calculate the total number of
shares earned by active members and the value of shares using (i) any
available Chapter 185 premium tax revenue received during the year under
subsection 55.29(c) and (ii) funds forfeited from members who separate from
service without having been granted an early, normal or disability pension.
The Board will calculate the value of the available funds and divide it by
the total number of shares earned by active members to determine the monetary
value of one (1) share for the year, less administrative expenses. The Board
shall report the value of one (1) share to the FOP and the City annually.



(Example 1: A member with 10 years of credited service would earn 120 shares.
If the value of a share is $2.00 per share, a member's share value will be
$240.00 at the time of distribution. Example 2: A member with 25 years of
credited service would earn three hundred (300) shares. If the value of a
share is $2.000 per share, a member's share value will be $600.00 at the time
of distribution.)



      (3)   In the event a Police Share Plan member separates from
City employment without having been granted an early, normal or disability
pension, the member shall forfeit his/her share account balance, and the
forfeited account balance shall be added to the available funds for that
year. A member who separates from City employment on or after being granted
an early, normal or disability pension shall be entitled to a vested share
balance.



   (D)   Interest crediting. On September 30 of each year share
accounts shall be credited with interest at an annual rate equal to the
market rate of return on pension fund investments for that fiscal year ended
September 30, net of investment related expenses as reported by the System's
Investment Consultant. Available funds and share account balances shall be
commingled with assets of the Fund for investment purposes, and invested by
the Board with other Fund assets. The Plan Administrator shall provide an
annual statement to the Board and each Police Share Plan member on or before
June 1 of each year showing each member's individual share account balance
and the interest credited to the member's account for the preceding year. The
expense of administering the Police Share Plan for the preceding year shall
be determined by the Board and charged against the available funds received
for that year, before allocations are made to the member share accounts. If
no funds are available, Police administration fees shall be paid by the
Police Fund.



   (E)   Share Plan Distributions. Distributions shall only be
available for members who separate from City employment after having been
granted an early, normal or disability pension, hereinafter "vested" Police
Share Plan members. Police Share Plan funds shall be distributed as follows,
depending on the date that a vested Police Share Plan member separates from
service:



      (1)   Separation prior to annual approval: If a vested Police
Share Plan member separates from City employment between October 1st and the

within ninety (90) days after the Board approves the share balances for the
most recent September 30th.



      (2)   Separation after annual approval: If a vested Police
Share Plan member separates from City employment after the date the Board
approves the share balances of the most recent September 30th, the full share
balance as of the most recent September 30th shall be distributed within
ninety (90) days.



   (F)   Rollovers. All or any portion of a member's share account
distribution may be rolled over to an IRA or other qualified plan in
accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. If a member dies before
retirement, the member's share account balance on the date of death shall be
distributed in a lump sum to the member's designated beneficiary or estate in
accordance with subsection 55.29 (E)(1) or (E)(2) above.



   (G)   Rule-making authority. The Board shall be authorized to adopt
any rules necessary for the administration of the Police Share Plan.

Share Plan shall be initially funded with the sum of $7,840.00, representing
unallocated Chapter 175 funds in the excess state money reserve as of October
1, 2015 in excess of $150,000.  For accounting purposes, an individual share
account shall be established for each active firefighter member, including
DROP participants. An eligible active Fire Share Plan "member" is defined as
a firefighter who is currently making contributions to the System, on
military leave, or participating in the DROP, on or after September 30, 2015.
The initial allocation of the excess state monies reserve shall be made to
the share accounts of eligible members based on the credited service of each
eligible member. Each eligible member shall receive an initial allocation
equal to the total months of credited service of the individual member
divided by the total months of credited service of the all eligible members.
The Fire Share Plan shall account for each member's share account balance as
provided herein.



   (C)   Annual determination. Each year, after receipt of the annual
distribution of Chapter 175 money from the State, the Board, in consultation
with their actuary, shall determine the amount of available premium tax
revenue, if any, received pursuant to F.S. § 175.351. Premium tax revenue is
not available for payment into the Fire Share Plan unless the annual premium
tax distribution exceeds $825,324 (hereinafter the "special benefit
threshold"). If the annual premium tax distribution exceeds the special
benefit threshold, fifty percent (50%) of the sum above $825,324 shall be
paid into the Fire Share Plan. The remaining fifty percent (50%) shall be
used to reduce the City's annual pension contribution. In future years in
which there are available funds, each member on September 30th of each year
shall receive an equal share of the available funds received during the

by the Board and charged against the available funds received for that year,
before allocations are made to the member share accounts. If no funds are
available, administration fees shall be paid by the Fire Pension Plan.

final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition.



   (G)   Action by city. When a petition has been determined sufficient
and presented to the City Council, the city may proceed with the special
assessment in accordance with law.

property owners shall be made by dividing the total number of parcels
represented by valid signatures on the petitions by the total number of
platted lots and/or parcels of land of record in the designated assessment
area in accordance with the records of the property appraiser's office, the
quotient of which must be greater than fifty percent (50%).

HOME RULE ASSESSMENT ACT



§ 56.20  HOME RULE ASSESSMENT ACT ESTABLISHED.



   Sections 56.20 through 56.27 shall be known as and may be referred to
as the "Home Rule Assessment Act," the provisions of which shall only be
applicable to special assessments imposed prior to May 1, 2017. The city may
finance the costs of the projects by levying, and collecting assessments on
any property specially benefitted thereby, as provided in Section 6.02 of the
City Charter, in §§ 56.01 through 56.07, and herein.  Assessments may be
levied only on specially benefitted real property and only at a rate of
assessment not exceeding the special benefit accruing to such property from
the specific project, the cost of which is being financed with such
assessment.



   (A)   (1)   Projects. The City may, by resolution of the Council:



         (a)   Provide for the construction, reconstruction,
repair, paving, repaving, hard surfacing, rehard surfacing, widening,
guttering, and draining of streets, boulevards, and alleys; for grading,
regrading, leveling, laving, relaying, paving, repaving, hard surfacing, and
rehard surfacing of sidewalks; for constructing or reconstructing permanent

appurtenances thereto;



         (d)   Pay for the relocation of utilities, including the
placement underground of electrical, telephone, and cable television

contained in this paragraph shall affect a utility's right to locate or
relocate its facilities on its own initiative at its own expense;



         (e)   Provide for the construction or reconstruction of
parks and other public recreational facilities and improvements, including
appurtenances thereto;

costs of any such improvements by levying and collecting special assessments
on the abutting, adjoining, contiguous, or other specially benefitted
property.



      (2)   Any one of the foregoing Subsections  (a) through (i)
is referred to herein as a "project" or "projects."



   (B)   Method of assessment. Assessments against property specially
benefitted by a Project may be levied upon the specially benefitted property
in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom, when the project
provides a benefit which is different in type or degree from benefits
provided to the community as a whole, such special benefits to be determined
and prorated according to a method of apportionment recommended by the city's
independent consultant based upon one or more of the following methods or any
combination thereof:



      (1)   The foot frontage of the respective properties specially
benefitted by the project;



      (2)   The square footage of the respective properties
specially benefitted by the project;



      (3)   Equivalent measurement units appropriate to the type of
project being constructed, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, "equivalent residential units" or "equivalent residential
connections" with respect to water and/or sewer utility projects;



      (4)   Ad valorem values where the benefit is determined to be
related to the value of the benefitted properties; or



      (5)   Such other method as shall apportion the assessments
equitably among the specially benefitted property.



   (C)   Procedure for levy of assessments.



      (1)   Resolution declaring projects and assessments.  When
the City Council determines to construct any project and to defray the whole
or any part of the cost thereof by assessments, the Council shall adopt a
resolution stating (a) the nature of the proposed project, (b) the location
of the project, (c) the portion of the cost thereof to be paid by
assessments, (d) the manner in which the assessments shall be made, (e) when
the assessments are to be paid, and (f) what part, if any of the cost of the
improvements, shall be paid from the General Fund or other funds of the city.



         (a)   Such resolution shall also designate the lands
upon which the assessments shall be levied, and in describing the lands it
shall be sufficient to describe them as "all lots and lands adjoining and
contiguous or bounding and abutting upon such improvements, or specially
benefitted thereby, and further designated by the assessment plat described
below."



         (b)   The resolution shall also state the total
estimated cost of the project.  Such estimated cost may include the cost of
construction or reconstruction; the cost of all labor and materials; the cost
of all lands, property rights, easements and franchises acquired; financing
charges; interest prior to and during construction, and for one year after
completion of construction; discount on the sale of obligations (as defined
in § 56.21); the cost of plans and specifications, surveys, and estimates of
costs and of revenues; the cost of engineering and legal services; all other
expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or
practicability of such construction or reconstruction; administrative
expenses; and such other costs as may be necessary or incident to the
financing thereof, including reimbursement to the city of money advanced for
such costs.



         (c)   The resolution provided for in this subsection,
Paragraph (1) above, may be combined with and adopted at the same time as the
resolution referred to in this subsection, Paragraph (5) below.



      (2)   Description of improvements, with estimated cost of
proposed improvement, required before adoption of resolution.  At the time
of the adoption of the resolution specified in this subsection, Paragraph (1)
above, there shall be on file with the City Clerk, (a) an assessment plat
showing the area to be assessed, (b) a description of the project, which
description may include preliminary or final plans or drawings, and (c) an
estimate of cost of the proposed project, all of which shall be open to
inspection by the public.



      (3)   Publication of resolution. Upon the adoption of the
resolution specified in Paragraph (1) above, the City Clerk shall cause such
resolution to be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in
the city.



      (4)   Preliminary assessment roll.  At or prior to the time
of the adoption of the resolution described in Paragraph (1) above, the
Council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll. The
preliminary assessment roll shall (a) identify by parcel numbers or by other
method sufficient to provide notice to the owners thereof of the lots and
lands to be assessed and (b) the amount of the benefit to, and the assessment
against, each lot or parcel of land.



      (5)   Publication of preliminary assessment roll.



         (a)   Upon completion of the preliminary assessment
roll, the Council shall by resolution fix a time and place at which the
owners of the property to be assessed, or any other persons interested
therein, may appear and be heard as to (a) the propriety and advisability of
constructing the project, (b) the cost thereof, (c) the manner of payment
therefore, and (d) the amount thereof to be assessed against each parcel
benefitted thereby.



         (b)   Not less than 20 days prior written notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be sent to the owners of the parcels to
be benefitted by the project. The notice shall include (a) the parcel
identification number of the property to be assessed, (b) the unit basis upon
which the assessment is being levied, (c) the number of units allocated to
the particular parcel, (d) the total assessment against the parcel, (e) the
estimated annual payment amount if the assessment is paid in installments,
and (f) the total of payments that are estimated to be made if the assessment
is paid in installments. The notice shall be sent via U.S. Postal Service,
first-class mail, postage prepaid, or by such other method as shall be
determined by the City Clerk to each of such property owners at his last
known address. Proof of such sending shall be made by affidavit of the City
Clerk or Deputy City Clerk, by the City Engineer, or by such agent of the
city as shall be designated by the City Clerk, such proof to be filed with
the City Clerk; provided, that failure to send such notice or notices shall
not invalidate any of the proceedings hereunder. The names and addresses of
the owners of the benefitted properties shall be obtained from the records of
the Property Appraiser or from such other sources as the City Clerk or City
Engineer deems reliable. The notice required by this Paragraph (5) may be
combined with the notice of intent provided for in § 56.01, provided that
any such combined notice shall provide for a public hearing to be (a) no
earlier than the date for declaration of the results of the election as
provided in § 56.06, and (b) that the public hearing for a particular
project will be canceled if the project is not approved as provided in §
56.06(B).



         (c)   Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall
comply with the provisions of F.S. § 197.3632.



      (6)   Council to hear complaints and adjust assessments;
confirmation of roll; rebate of difference in cost and assessment.  At the
time and place named in the notice specified in Paragraph (5) above, the
Council shall meet to hear and consider any and all complaints as to the
assessments and shall adjust and equalize the assessments on a basis of
justice and right. When so equalized and approved by resolution of the
Council, a final assessment roll shall be filed with the City Clerk, and such
assessments shall stand confirmed and constitute, until paid, valid and
binding liens upon the property against which such assessments are made,
coequal with other governmental liens for unpaid taxes, as more particularly
provided in Subsection (D) below.



         (a)   Promptly after such confirmation, the assessment
roll shall be recorded by the City Clerk in the official records of the city,
and such record of the liens shall constitute prima facie evidence of their
validity.



         (b)   Upon completion of the project, the City shall
credit to each of the parcels assessed the difference in the amount of the
assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed and the proportionate
part of the actual cost to be paid by assessments as finally determined upon
the completion of the project, but in no event shall the final assessments
exceed the lesser of (a) the amount of benefits determined to accrue to the
property or (b) one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount originally
assessed.



      (7)   Use of uniform method; combined notices and hearings. 
In the event that the Council may determine to consider use of the uniform
method for collection of assessments, as set forth in F.S. Ch. 197, notice of
intent to use the uniform method may be combined with the publication of the
resolution provided for in Paragraph (1) above or with the publication of
notice of the hearing on the preliminary assessment roll provided for in
Paragraph (5) above; in such event, the publication shall comply with the
provisions of F.S. § 197.3632(3)(a), regarding content and publication
requirements, and the mailed notice shall comply with the requirements of
F.S. § 197.3632(4)(b), regarding content and mailing requirements.



         (a)    At the hearing on use of the uniform  method, 
if the Council shall determine to use  the uniform method, it shall 
adopt  a resolution satisfying the  requirements  of F.S. §
197.3632(3)(a), which  may  be combined with  the  resolution required 
by  Paragraph (1) above  into  one resolution.  At  the hearing 
approving the preliminary assessment  roll, the  Council  shall adopt 
a  resolution satisfying the requirements  of  F.S. § 197.3632(4)(c),
which  may be combined with the resolution required by Paragraph (5) above
into one resolution.



         (b)   In the event that the Council shall determine to
use the uniform method in connection with the collection of the assessments:
(a) there shall be added to the amount of the annual installment due with
respect to each parcel an amount necessary to compensate the County Property
Appraiser and County Tax Collector for such fees and charges as they may
impose in connection with the collection of such assessments; (b) the amount
of each annual installment of the assessment due with respect to each parcel
shall be adjusted as deemed necessary by the Council to take into account
discounts allowed for early payment of annual installments of assessments and
taxes as provided for in Fla. Stat. Ch. 197; and (c) the annual rate of
interest used to calculate the amount of each annual installment of special
assessments may be assumed to be one percent per annum greater than the net
interest cost (as hereinafter defined) on the obligations issued to finance
the project with respect to which the assessments are levied.



         (c)   The city may enter into interlocal agreements with
the County Property Appraiser and the County Tax Collector regarding (a) any
services to be provided by them in connection with the preparation of the
assessment roll, (b) the collection of the assessments, (c) prepayment of
assessments, and (d) sales of tax certificates and tax deeds with respect to
any assessed parcels.



   (D)   Payment of assessments; prepayment; method and terrn of
installment payment; extent and priority of lien; interest.  Assessments
shall be payable at the time and in the manner stipulated in the notice
mailed pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (5) above, unless provided
otherwise by resolution of the Council.



      (1)   Assessments may be paid in full within such period of
not less than thirty (30) days following the adoption of the resolution
referred to in Subsection (C), Paragraph (6) above, at such place or places
as shall be specified by the Council in such resolution, and, if so paid, may
be allowed a discount in such amount as shall be determined by the Council to
be allocable to the cost of financing the portion of the project to be
financed with assessments paid in installments, including, but not limited
to, costs of issuance of obligations, capitalized interest and debt service
reserves for obligations, legal and financing fees and expenses, the cost of
municipal bond insurance premiums, discount on the sale of obligations, and
such other expenses as are necessary or desirable in connection with the
issuance of the obligations.



      (2)   Assessments which are not paid in full as provided above
may, in the discretion of the Council, be made payable as nearly as
practicable (a) in equal principal installments to which shall be added
interest on the unpaid principal balance or (b) in equal annual installments
of principal and interest, with interest computed on the unpaid principal
balance.



      (3)   In the discretion of the Council, assessments for
projects payable in installments may be made over a period not to exceed the
lesser of (a) the estimated useful life of the project or (b) thirty (30)
years from the date of approval of the final assessment roll pursuant to
Subsection (C), Paragraph (6) above.



      (4)   Unpaid assessments shall constitute a lien against the
benefitted properly in an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the
assessment together with (a) interest and penalties thereon to the date of
payment, (b) interest on the obligations issued to finance such assessments
to the first date on which such obligations can be redeemed without penalty,
and (c) any fees and expenses related to the collection of such assessments.



      (5)   Failure to pay assessments being collected using the
uniform method pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (7) above, shall not
give rise to duplicate liens against the assessed parcels based on the sale
of tax certificates or the issuance of tax deeds against the affected parcel;
the amount of the assessment lien hereunder against a parcel shall be for the
unpaid amount of the assessment and the interest and fees associated
therewith as provided above.



      (6)   The lien against properties for unpaid assessments and
interest and expenses associated therewith as provided above shall be a lien
coequal with the lien of all state, county, and municipal taxes, and shall be
superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims. Satisfaction of
assessment liens shall be evidenced by certificate of the City Clerk or the
County Tax Collector, recorded in the Official Records of the city and/or the
county relating to the property assessed. For the purposes of determining the
amount of a recorded special assessment lien in disbursing the proceeds from
tax sale deeds, the lien of record against any property shall be deemed to be
the amount due but not yet paid increased by the amount of any interest and
cost of collection if delinquent. No proceeds from tax sale deeds shall be
used to pay any assessment unless sufficient proceeds are available to pay in
full the assessment.



      (7)   Unpaid assessments shall bear interest at a rate of
eight percent (8%) per annum or, if obligations have been issued secured by
the payment of such assessments, then the unpaid assessments shall bear
interest at a rate equal to the greater of (a) eight percent (8%) per annum
or, (b) the net interest cost rate on such obligations plus one percent (1%)
per annum, such interest to accrue from the date of issuance of the
obligations. For purposes of this paragraph, "net interest cost rate" shall
mean the "Net Interest Cost" as shown on Line 20, Column (g), Form 8038-G,
Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, or a rate calculated in
a comparable manner.



   (E)   Legal proceedings instituted upon failure of property owner to
pay special assessment or interest when due; foreclosure; service of
process.  If the Council has not elected to use the uniform method with
respect to any assessments, the following provisions shall apply to such
assessments. Each annual assessment installment shall be paid upon the dates
specified in the notice mailed pursuant to Subsection (C), Paragraph (5)
above, unless provided otherwise by resolution of the Council, with interest
upon all deferred payments, until the entire amount of the assessment has
been paid. Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any annual
installment due, or any part thereof, or any annual interest upon deferred
payments, the Council may cause to be brought the necessary legal proceedings
to enforce payment thereof with all accrued interest and penalties, together
with all legal costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be
assessed as part of the costs. In the event of default in the payment of any
installment of an assessment, or any accrued interest on such assessment, the
whole assessment, with the interest and penalties thereon, shall immediately
become due and payable and subject to foreclosure. In the foreclosure of any
special assessment, service of process against unknown or nonresident
defendants may be had by publication, as provided by law. The foreclosure
proceedings shall be prosecuted to a sale and conveyance of the property
involved in such proceedings as now provided by law in suits to foreclose
mortgages, or, in the alternative, such proceeding may be instituted and
prosecuted under Fla. Stat. Ch. 173, or as otherwise provided by law.



   (F)   Council required to make new assessments until valid
assessment is made if special assessment is omitted or held invalid.  If any
assessment made under the provisions of this section shall be either in whole
or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if
the Council shall be satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or
defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the Council
shall have omitted to make such assessment when it might have done so, the
Council shall take all necessary steps to cause a new assessment to be made
for the whole or any part of any project or against any property benefitted
by any project, following as nearly as may be the provisions of this section,
and in case such second assessment shall be annulled, the Council shall
obtain and make other assessments until a valid assessment shall be made.



   (G)   Assessment roll sufficient evidence of assessment and other
proceedings of this subchapter; variance not material unless party objecting
materially injured thereby.  Any informality or irregularity in the
proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the
provisions of this subchapter shall not affect the validity of the assessment
where the assessment roll has been confirmed by the Council. The assessment
roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient
evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly
made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of
the assessment roll were duly had, taken and performed as required by this
subchapter, and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held
material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially
prejudiced thereby. However, nothing in this section shall relieve the
Council or the City Clerk from the obligation to notify the affected property
owners of the assessments as required by this subchapter.



   (H)   Other expenditures for projects.  The city may pay out of its
general fund or out of any special fund that may be provided for that
purpose, such portion of the cost of any project as it may deem proper.



   (I)   Plats, plans and specifications.  All assessment plats, plans
and specifications, cost estimates and records of the names and addresses of
the owners of property to be assessed shall be kept and maintained by the
engineering, public works, or other similar department of the city, or such
other office or officer of the city as may be specified by the Council from
time to time.



   (J)   Amendment.  Before or after the issuance of Obligations as
described in this subchapter, the project or projects for which such
obligations are authorized may be amended or substituted by the amendment of
the resolution authorizing the obligations.  If such amendment shall involve
a change in the location or nature of any project, or a change in the
benefitted property or in the amount of such benefit, the Council shall,
before or after the amendment to the resolution, proceed to amend the
assessment roll and record the appropriate notations in the official records
of the city. The procedures set forth in Subsection (C), Paragraph (5) above,
shall be followed in making such amendment to the assessment roll and the
official records of the city. The assessments levied as a result of such
amendment or substitution of projects, together with the assessments
previously levied and not amended or substituted, shall be not less than the
amount necessary to provide for payment of the principal, interest and
applicable redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium with respect to the
obligations.

§ 56.21  OBLIGATIONS.



   (A)   In general.  To pay the cost of the projects and other costs
necessary or incidental thereto, including but not limited to the costs of
issuance of such obligations, the city is authorized to issue, or cause to be
issued on behalf of the city, as the case may be, bonds, notes, certificates,
and other forms of indebtedness (collectively, the "obligations") from time
to time. Such obligations may be issued in bearer form or fully registered
form; may be delivered by means of physical certificates or a book-entry
system, or any combination thereof; may be in such denomination or
denominations; may bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding the
maximum rate allowed by law, payable on a current basis or at maturity; and
may mature at such time or times (not exceeding two (2) years after the last
special assessment installment payment date for obligations secured solely by
special assessments); all as shall be determined by the Council at or prior
to the time of sale of the obligations. The obligations may be made
redeemable or subject to mandatory tender for purchase before maturity, at
the option of the city or the holders thereof, at such price or prices and
under such terms and conditions as shall be fixed by the Council prior to
their issuance. The Council shall determine the place or places of payment of
the principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the obligations,
which may be at the office of the City Clerk, or any bank or trust company
within or without the State of Florida. The obligations shall be signed by
the manual or facsimile signature of the Mayor, and attested by the manual or
facsimile signature of the City Clerk, and may further be authenticated on
behalf of the city by the City Clerk or a bank or trust company which may be
acting as registrar of the obligations, whichever is applicable; provided,
that such obligations shall bear at least one signature which is manually
executed thereon; and shall have the seal of the city affixed, imprinted,
reproduced or lithographed thereon; all as shall be prescribed in the
resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of the obligations. The
obligations may be delivered to any contractor for payment of his work in
constructing projects, or may be sold at public or private sale at such price
or prices as the Council shall determine.



   (B) Special assessment bonds.



      (1)   Project Sinking Fund.  Before or after the adoption of
the resolutions described in Subsection (C), Paragraphs (5) and (6) above,
the city may authorize the issuance of obligations in an aggregate principal
amount not in excess of the aggregate amount of the assessments to be levied
against the property specially benefitted by the projects. A special fund,
known as "Special Assessment Bonds, Series , Sinking Fund," shall be used for
the payment of the principal, redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium
and interest on such obligations. All the proceeds collected by the city with
respect to the assessment liens for the project shall be deposited and held
in such Fund. Any surplus remaining after payment of all such obligations may
be used (a) to reimburse the city for any moneys expended or advanced to pay
the cost of the project for which the assessments were levied or to make
payments of debt service on the obligations, (b) to rebate to the owners of
properties assessed a pro rata portion of the amounts originally assessed,
(c) to pay the cost of other improvements benefitting the properties
assessed, (d) to pay for other capital improvements in the city, or (e) for
other lawful municipal purposes.



      (2)   Financing of multiple projects.  The city is hereby
authorized to finance multiple projects with a single issuance of
obligations, and to issue obligations prior to the equalization, approval and
confirmation of the assessment roll for a project. The city shall not be
required to let contracts for any projects before adoption of any resolution
authorizing the issuance of obligations. It shall not be necessary for
specially benefitted property to connect to any utility projects before
assessments may be collected therefore, as long as connections are or will,
within a reasonable time after completion of the project, be available from
the city. The City Clerk shall not be required to certify in regard to any
obligations that the amount of assessment liens levied as security for any
obligations are equal to the amount of the obligations.



(Ord. 2002-68, passed 11-7-02)



§ 56.22  REFUNDING OBLIGATIONS.



   The city may issue obligations to refund any obligations issued under
the authority of this subchapter, and provide for the rights of the owners
thereof. Such refunding obligations may be issued in an amount sufficient (a)
to pay any expenses of the issuance and sale of such refunding obligations
and (b) together with the income from the investment of a portion of the
proceeds of sale of such refunding obligations, to pay (a) the principal of
the outstanding obligations, (b) the interest due and payable on the
outstanding obligations, and (c) the redemption and/or mandatory purchase
premium, if applicable, on the outstanding obligations.

Constitution, section 166.021, Florida Statutes, and the City of Palm Bay
Charter, the City has all powers of local self-government to perform
municipal functions and to render municipal services except as otherwise
provided by law and such power may be exercised by the enactment of City
ordinances.



      (2)   In 2016, the City's electors voted to amend section 6.02
of the City Charter to allow for the imposition of Assessments to fund a wide
range of projects without prior referendum approval.



      (3)   The Assessments to be imposed pursuant to this
subchapter shall constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and
intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.



      (4)   The Assessments to be imposed pursuant to this
subchapter are imposed by the Council, not Brevard County, the Property
Appraiser, or Tax Collector. The duties of the Property Appraiser and Tax
Collector under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act are ministerial.



      (5)   The purpose of this subchapter is to: (1) provide
procedures and standards for the imposition of Assessments within the City by
resolution under the general home rule powers of a City to impose special
assessments, and (2) authorize a procedure for the funding of public
services, facilities, programs, or Local Improvements providing special
benefit to subsequently identified property within the City.



(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)



§ 56.41  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Creation of assessment areas.



      (1)   The Council is hereby authorized to create Assessment
Areas in accordance with the procedures set forth herein to include property
located within the City that is specially benefitted by the services,
facilities, programs, or Local Improvements proposed for funding from the
proceeds of Assessments to be imposed therein. 



      (2)   Either the Initial Assessment Resolution proposing each
Assessment Area or the Final Assessment Resolution creating each Assessment
Area shall include brief descriptions of the proposed services, facilities,
programs, or Local Improvements, a description of the property to be included
within the Assessment Area, and specific legislative findings that recognize
the special benefit to be provided by each proposed service, facility,
program, or Local Improvements to property within the Assessment Area.



      (3)   At its option, the Council may establish a process
pursuant to which the owners of property may petition for creation of an
Assessment Area to fund services, facilities, programs, or Local
Improvements.  Notwithstanding any petition process established pursuant to
this section, the Council shall retain the authority to create Assessment
Areas without a landowner petition.



   (B)   Revisions to assessments.  If any Assessment made under the
provisions of this subchapter is either in whole or in part annulled,
vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction,
or if the Council is satisfied that any such Assessment is so irregular or
defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the Council
has omitted to include any property on the Assessment Roll which property
should have been so included, the Council may take all necessary steps to
impose a new Assessment against any property benefited by the Service Costs,
Capital Costs or Project Costs, following as nearly as may be practicable,
the provisions of this subchapter, and in case such second Assessment is
annulled, vacated, or set aside, the Council may obtain and impose other
Assessments until a valid Assessment is imposed.



   (C)   Procedural irregularities.  Any informality or irregularity
in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any Assessment under the
provisions of this subchapter shall not affect the validity of the same after
the approval thereof, and any Assessment, as finally approved, shall be
competent and sufficient evidence that such Assessment was duly levied, that
the Assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings
adequate to such Assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required
by this subchapter; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be
held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was
materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Subsection, any party objecting to an Assessment imposed pursuant to this
subchapter must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction
within the time periods prescribed herein.



   (D)   Correction of errors and omissions.



      (1)   No act of error or omission on the part of the Property
Appraiser, Tax Collector, City Manager, City Council, their deputies,
employees, or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation
for payment of an Assessment imposed by the Council under the provision of
this subchapter.



      (2)   When it shall appear that any Assessment should have
been imposed under this subchapter against a lot or parcel of property
specially benefited by the provision of a service, facility, program, or
Local Improvement, but such property was omitted from the Assessment Roll,
the Council may, upon provision of appropriate notice as set forth in this
section, impose the applicable Assessment for the Fiscal Year in which such
error is discovered. Such total Assessment shall become delinquent if not
fully paid upon the expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of
said resolution. The Assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against
such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county,
district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank
and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to
or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in §
56.45 hereof.



      (3)   The City Manager shall have the authority at any time,
upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from
the Owner of any Assessed Property, to correct any error in applying the
Assessment apportionment method to any particular property not otherwise
requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act. Any such correction that reduces an Assessment shall be
considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the
Assessment imposed under the provisions of this subchapter.  Any such
correction which increases an Assessment or imposes an Assessment on omitted
property shall first require notice to the affected owner in the manner
described in §§ 56.42(E) and 56.43(E) hereof, as applicable, providing the
date, time and place that the Council will consider confirming the correction
and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard.  All requests from
affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections
shall be referred to, and processed by, the City Manager and not the Property
Appraiser or Tax Collector.



      (4)   After the Assessment Roll has been delivered to the Tax
Collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any
changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance
with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the
Tax Roll upon timely written request and direction of the City Manager.



   (E)   Lien of assessments.



      (1)   Upon the adoption of the Assessment Roll, all
Assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and
dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and
special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be
superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims,
until paid.



      (2)   The lien for an Assessment shall be deemed perfected
upon adoption by the Council of the Final Assessment Resolution or the Annual
Rate Resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for an Assessment
collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the
property as provided by law.  The lien for an Assessment collected under the
alternative method of collection provided in § 56.44(B) shall be deemed
perfected upon adoption by the Council of the Final Assessment Resolution or
the Annual Rate Resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the
property on such date of adoption.



   (F)   Authorization for exemptions and hardship assistance.



      (1)   The Council, in its sole discretion, shall determine
whether to provide exemptions from payment of an Assessment for Government
Property or other property whose use is wholly or partially exempt from ad
valorem taxation under Florida law.



      (2)   The Council, in its sole discretion, shall determine
whether to provide a program of hardship assistance, either through monetary
contributions or extended payment terms, to City residents who are living
below or close to the poverty level and are at risk of losing title to their
homes as a result of the imposition of an Assessment.



      (3)   The Council shall designate the funds available to
provide any exemptions or hardship assistance.  The provision of an
exemption or hardship assistance in any one year shall in no way establish a
right or entitlement to such exemption or assistance in any subsequent year
and the provision of funds in any year may be limited to the extent funds are
available and appropriated by the Council. Any funds designated for
exemptions or hardship assistance shall be paid by the City from funds other
than those generated by the Assessment.



      (4)   Any shortfall in the expected Assessment proceeds due to
any hardship assistance or exemption from payment of the Assessments required
by law or authorized by the Council shall be supplemented by any legally
available funds, or combination of such funds, and shall not be paid for by
proceeds or funds derived from the Assessments.  In the event a court of
competent jurisdiction determines any exemption or reduction by the Council
is improper or otherwise adversely affects the validity of the Assessment
imposed for any Fiscal Year, the sole and exclusive remedy shall be the
imposition of an Assessment upon each affected Tax Parcel in the amount of
the Assessment that would have been otherwise imposed save for such reduction
or exemption afforded to such Tax Parcel by the Council.



(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)

   (A)   General authority.



      (1)   The Council is hereby authorized to impose an annual
Service Assessment to fund all or any portion of the Service Cost on
benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit
accruing to such property from the City's provision of the subsequently
identified service, facility, or program.



      (2)   The amount of the Service Assessment that is imposed
each Fiscal Year against each parcel of Assessed Property shall be determined
pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of
property designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the
Service Cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special
benefit provided by the service, facility, or program funded with assessment
proceeds.



      (3)   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed
to require the imposition of Assessments against Government Property.



      (4)   All Service Assessments shall be imposed in conformity
with the procedures set forth in this § 56.42.



   (B)   Initial assessment resolution. The first step for the initial

within any proposed Assessment Area; (B) containing a brief and general
description of the services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (C)
determining the Service Cost to be assessed; (D) describing the method of

conforming to the description contained on the Tax Roll.



         (b)   The name of the Owner of the Assessed Property.



         (c)   The number of Assessment Units attributable to
each parcel.



         (d)   The estimated maximum annual assessment for each
Assessment Unit.



         (e)   The amount of the Service Assessment to be imposed
against each Assessed Property.



      (2)   Copies of the Initial Assessment Resolution and the
preliminary Assessment Roll shall be available in the office of the City
Manager and open to public inspection.  The foregoing shall not be construed
to require that the Assessment Roll be in printed form if the amount of the
Service Assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a
computer terminal available to the public.



   (D)   Notice by publication. Upon completion of the initial
Assessment Roll and each year thereafter, the City Manager shall publish

shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act.



   (E)   Notice by mail.



      (1)   For the initial Fiscal Year in which a Service

validity of the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for
payment of a Service Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this
subchapter.



      (4)   Notice by mail for Fiscal Years after the initial Fiscal
Year shall be controlled by § 56.42(H)(6) hereof.



   (F)   Final assessment resolution.



      (1)   The last step for the imposition of a Service Assessment
for the initial Fiscal Year shall be the Council's adoption of a Final
Assessment Resolution.



      (2)   At the time named in the notices required by § 56.42(D)
and (E) or to such time as an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the
Council, the Council shall receive any written objections of interested
persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the Council, adopt the
Final Assessment Resolution which shall (A) create any Assessment Area; (B)
confirm, modify, or repeal the Initial Assessment Resolution with such
amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the Council; (C)
establish the Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the Council and set the
rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; (D) approve the
initial Assessment Roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and
(E) determine the method of collection.



      (3)   All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from
the service, facility, or program to be provided or constructed and the
Service Assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned among the
properties that receive the special benefit.



      (4)   All objections to the Final Assessment Resolution shall
be made in writing, and filed with the City Manager at or before the time or
adjourned time of such hearing.



      (5)   The Final Assessment Resolution shall constitute the
Annual Rate Resolution for the initial Fiscal Year in which Assessments are
imposed or reimposed hereunder.



   (G)   Effect of final assessment resolution.  The Service
Assessments for the initial Fiscal Year shall be established upon adoption of
the Final Assessment Resolution. The adoption of the Final Assessment
Resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented
(including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment,
the Maximum Assessment Rate, the initial rate of assessment, the initial
Assessment Roll, and the levy and lien of the Service Assessments), unless
proper steps are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure
relief within 20 days from the date of Council action on the Final Assessment
Resolution. The initial Assessment Roll, as approved by the Final Assessment
Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector, or the Property
Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method is
used to collect the Service Assessments, such other official as the Council
by resolution shall designate.



   (H)   Subsequent year adoption procedures.



      (1)   Annually, during the budget adoption process, the
Council shall determine whether to reimpose a Service Assessment for each
Fiscal Year following the initial Fiscal Year.  If the Council elects to
reimpose a Service Assessment, the procedures in this § 56.42(H) shall be
followed.



      (2)   The first step for the reimposition of an annual Service
Assessment after the initial Fiscal Year shall be the adoption of a
Preliminary Rate Resolution by the Council (1) containing a brief and general
description of the services, facilities, or programs to be provided; (2)
determining the Service Cost to be assessed for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (3)
establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (4)
establishing or increasing a Maximum Assessment Rate, if desired by the
Council; (5) authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to
receive and consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of
the Annual Rate Resolution for the upcoming Fiscal Year; and (6) directing
the City Manager to (a) update the Assessment Roll, (b) provide notice by
publication and first class mail to affected Owners in the event
circumstances described in subsection (H)(6) so require, and (c) directing
and authorizing any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper,
necessary or convenient by the City.



      (3)   The second step for the reimposition of an annual
Service Assessment after the initial Fiscal Year shall be the adoption of an
Annual Rate Resolution by the Council.  At the public hearing established in
the Preliminary Rate Resolution or to which an adjournment or continuance may
be taken by the Council, the Council shall receive any oral or written
objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting
of the Council, adopt the Annual Rate Resolution, which shall (1) establish
the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming Fiscal Year and (2)
approve the Assessment Roll for the upcoming Fiscal Year with such
adjustments as the Council deems just and right. The Assessment Roll shall be
prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the
Initial Assessment Resolution, or any subsequent Preliminary Rate Resolution,
together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the
Final Assessment Resolution or any subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.



      (4)   Nothing herein shall preclude the Council from providing
annual notification to all Owners of Assessed Property in the manner provided
in § 56.42(D) and (E) or any other method as provided by law.



      (5)   The Council may establish or increase a Maximum
Assessment Rate in an Initial Assessment Resolution or Preliminary Rate
Resolution and confirm such Maximum Assessment Rate in the Final Assessment
Resolution or Annual Rate Resolution in the event notice of such Maximum Rate
Assessment has been included in the notices required by § 56.42(D) and (E).



      (6)   In the event (1) the proposed Assessment for any Fiscal
Year exceeds the rates of assessment adopted by the Council, including a
Maximum Assessment Rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously
provided to the Owners of Assessed Property, (2) the purpose for which the
Assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the Assessment is
substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to
the Owners of Assessed Property, (3) Assessed Property is reclassified or the
method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased
Assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the Owners
of Assessed Property, or (4) an Assessment Roll contains Assessed Property
that was not included on the Assessment Roll approved for the prior Fiscal
Year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the
Owners of such Assessed Property as provided by law. Such notice shall
substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in § 56.42(D)
and (E) and inform the Owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of
the Annual Rate Resolution. The failure of the Owner to receive such notice
due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the
Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a
Service Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this subchapter.



      (7)   As to any Assessed Property not included on an
Assessment Roll approved by the adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution
or a prior year's Annual Rate Resolution, the adoption of the succeeding
Annual Rate Resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues
presented as to such Assessed Property (including, but not limited to, the
determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the Assessed
Property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment,
the establishment or increase of a Maximum Assessment Rate, the Assessment
Roll, and the levy and lien of the Assessments), unless proper steps are
initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20
days from the date of the Council action on the Annual Rate Resolution.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the
finality of any Assessment not challenged within the required 20-day period
for those Assessments previously imposed against Assessed Property by the
inclusion of the Assessed Property on an Assessment Roll approved in the
Final Assessment Resolution or any subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.



      (8)   The Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Rate
Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector as required by the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in
§ 56.44(B) is used to collect the Assessments, such other official as the
Council by resolution shall designate. If the Assessment against any property
shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment shall be
made on the Assessment Roll.



   (I)   Interim service assessments.



      (1)   An interim Service Assessment may be imposed against all
property, for which a Certificate of Occupancy is issued, after adoption of
the Annual Rate Resolution. The amount of the interim Service Assessment
shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one twelfth of the
annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the Annual Rate
Resolution for the Fiscal Year for which the interim Service Assessment is
being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar
month remaining in the Fiscal Year. In addition to the monthly rate, the
interim Service Assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent
Fiscal Year Service Assessment.



      (2)   No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until full
payment of the interim Service Assessment is received by the City. Issuance
of the Certificate of Occupancy without the payment in full of the interim
Service Assessment shall not relieve the Owner of such property of the
obligation of full payment. Any interim Service Assessment not collected
prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy may be collected
pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in § 56.44(A)
of this subchapter or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim
Service Assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the
Certificate of Occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such
property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with
the liens of all state, City, district or municipal taxes and special
assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens,
encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property
involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the Certificate
of Occupancy.

      (1)   The Council is hereby authorized to impose Capital
Assessments against property located within an Assessment Area to fund all or
any portion of the Capital Cost or Project Cost, if obligations are issued,
of Local Improvements based on the special benefit accruing to such property
from the City's provision of the subsequently identified Local Improvement.



      (2)   The amount of the Capital Assessment shall be computed
in a manner that fairly and reasonably apportions the Capital Cost or Project
Cost, if obligations are issued, among the parcels of property within the
Assessment Area based upon objectively determinable Assessment Units and
reasonably related to the special benefit provided by the Local Improvement.



      (3)   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed
to require the imposition of Capital Assessments against Government Property.



      (4)   All Capital Assessments shall be imposed in conformity
with the procedures set forth in this § 56.43.



   (B)   Initial assessment resolution. The first step for the initial
imposition of a Capital Assessment shall be the Council's adoption of an
Initial Assessment Resolution (A) describing the property to be located
within the proposed Assessment Area; (B) containing a brief and general
description of the Local Improvements to be provided; (C) determining the
Capital Cost or Project Cost to be assessed for Local Improvements; (D)

   (C)   Capital assessment roll.



      (1)   The City Manager shall prepare, or direct the
preparation of, the initial Assessment Roll for Capital Assessments, which

      (2)   Copies of the Initial Assessment Resolution and the
preliminary Assessment Roll shall be available in the office of the City
Manager and open to public inspection.  The foregoing shall not be construed
to require that the Assessment Roll be in printed form if the amount of the
Capital Assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a
computer terminal available to the public.



   (D)   Notice by publication. Upon completion of the initial
Assessment Roll and each year thereafter, the City Manager shall publish
notice of a public hearing to adopt the Final Assessment Resolution and
approve the aforementioned initial Assessment Roll. The published notice
shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act.



   (E)   Notice by mail.



      (1)   For the initial Fiscal Year in which a Capital
Assessment is imposed by the Council against Assessed Property pursuant to
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and in addition to the published notice
required by § 56.43(D), the City Manager shall provide notice of the
proposed Capital Assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel
of property subject to a Capital Assessment.



      (2)   The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set
forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.



      (3)   Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to
the possession of the United States Postal Service.  Failure of the Owner to
receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the
validity of the Assessment Roll nor release or discharge any obligation for
payment of a Capital Assessment imposed by the Council pursuant to this
subchapter.



      (4)   Notice by mail for Fiscal Years after the initial Fiscal
Year shall be controlled by § 56.43(H)(2) hereof.



   (F)   Final assessment resolution.



      (1)   The last step for the imposition of a Capital Assessment
for the initial Fiscal Year shall be the Council's adoption of a Final
Assessment Resolution.



      (2)   At the time named in the notices required by § 56.43(D)
and (E) or to such time as an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the
Council, the Council shall receive any written objections of interested
persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the Council, adopt the
Final Assessment Resolution which shall (A) create any Assessment Area; (B)
confirm, modify, or repeal the Initial Assessment Resolution with such
amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the Council; (C)
establish the maximum amount of the Capital Assessment for each Assessment
Unit and levy the rate of assessment for the upcoming Fiscal Year; (D)
approve the initial Assessment Roll, with such amendments as it deems just
and right; and (E) determine the method of collection.



      (3)   All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from
the Local Improvement to be provided or constructed and the Capital
Assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties
that receive the special benefit.



      (4)   All objections to the Final Assessment Resolution shall
be made in writing, and filed with the City Manager at or before the time or
adjourned time of such hearing.



      (5)   The Final Assessment Resolution shall constitute the
Annual Rate Resolution for the initial Fiscal Year in which Assessments are
imposed or reimposed hereunder.



   (G)   Effect of final assessment resolution.  The Capital
Assessments for the initial Fiscal Year shall be established upon adoption of
the Final Assessment Resolution. The adoption of the Final Assessment
Resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented
(including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment,
the initial rate of assessment, the initial Assessment Roll, and the levy and
lien of the Capital Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a
court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date
of Council action on the Final Assessment Resolution. The initial Assessment
Roll, as approved by the Final Assessment Resolution, shall be delivered to
the Tax Collector, or the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax
Collector, or if an alternative method is used to collect the Capital
Assessments, such other official as the Council by resolution shall designate.



   (H)   Subsequent year adoption procedures.



      (1)   Annually, during the budget adoption process, the
Council shall adopt an Annual Rate Resolution for each Fiscal Year in which
Capital Assessments will be imposed to fund the Capital Cost or Project Cost
of a Local Improvement.  The Annual Rate Resolution shall (1) establish the
rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming Fiscal Year and (2) approve
the Assessment Roll for the upcoming Fiscal Year with such adjustments as the
Council deems just and right. The Assessment Roll shall be prepared in
accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the Initial
Assessment Resolution, as confirmed or amended by the Final Assessment
Resolution.  Failure to adopt an Annual Assessment Resolution during the
budget adoption process for a Fiscal Year may be cured at any time.



      (2)   In the event (1) the proposed Capital Assessment for any
Fiscal Year exceeds the Maximum Assessment Rate included in notice previously
provided to the Owners of Assessed Property, (2) the purpose for which the
Capital Assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented
by notice previously provided to the Owners of Assessed Property, (3)
Assessed Property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised
or altered resulting in an increased Capital Assessment from that represented
by notice previously provided to the owners of Assessed Property, or (4) an
Assessment Roll contains Assessed Property that was not included on the
Assessment Roll approved for the prior Fiscal Year, notice shall be provided
by publication and first class mail to the Owner of such Assessed Property as
provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice
requirements set forth in § 56.43(D) and (E) and inform the Owners of the
date, time and place for the adoption of the Annual Rate Resolution. The
failure of an Owner to receive such supplemental notice due to mistake or
inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the Assessment Roll nor
release or discharge any obligation for payment of a Capital Assessment
imposed by the Council pursuant to this subchapter.



      (3)   As to any Assessed Property not included on an
Assessment Roll approved by the adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution
or a prior year's Annual Rate Resolution, the adoption of the succeeding
Annual Rate Resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues
presented as to such Assessed Property (including, but not limited to, the
determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the Assessed
Property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment,
the establishment or increase of a Maximum Assessment Rate, the Assessment
Roll, and the levy and lien of the Assessments), unless proper steps are
initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20
days from the date of the Council action on the Annual Rate Resolution.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the
finality of any Assessment not challenged within the required 20-day period
for those Assessments previously imposed against Assessed Property by the
inclusion of the Assessed Property on an Assessment Roll approved in the
Final Assessment Resolution or any subsequent Annual Rate Resolution.



      (4)   The Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Rate
Resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector as required by the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or the Property Appraiser if so directed
by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method described in § 56.44(B) is
used to collect the Capital Assessments, such other official as the Council
by resolution shall designate. If the Capital Assessment against any property
shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the Council, an adjustment shall be
made on the Assessment Roll.



(Ord. 2017-35, passed 5-4-17)



§ 56.44  COLLECTION AND USE OF ASSESSMENTS.



   (A)   Method of collection.



      (1)   Unless otherwise directed by the Council, the
Assessments shall be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection
Act, and the City shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act. The Resolution of Intent required by the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act may be adopted either prior to or following the
Initial Assessment Resolution; provided however, that the Resolution of
Intent must be adopted prior to January 1 (or March 1 with consent of the
Property Appraiser and Tax Collector) of the year in which the Assessments
are first collected on the ad valorem tax bill.  Any hearing or notice
required by this subchapter may be combined with any other hearing or notice
required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.



      (2)   The amount of an Assessment to be collected using the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted
property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency,
delinquency fees and recording costs for prior years' assessment for a
comparable service, facility, program, or Local Improvement provided, (1) the
collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not
employ the use of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is
provided to the Owner, and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the prior
year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such Assessment upon
certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the Tax Collector by the City.



   (B)   Alternative method of collection.  In lieu of using the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the City may elect to collect the
assessment by any other method which is authorized by law or provided as
follows:



      (1)   The City shall provide Assessment bills by first class
mail to the Owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government
property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (a) a
brief explanation of the Assessment, (b) a description of the Assessment
Units used to determine the amount of the Assessment, (c) the number of
Assessment Units attributable to the parcel, (d) the total amount of the
parcel's Assessment for the appropriate period, (e) the location at which
payment will be accepted, (f) the date on which the Assessment is due, and
(g) a statement that the Assessment constitutes a lien against Assessed
Property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county,
district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments.



      (2)   A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition
of the Assessments shall be recorded in the official records of City of Palm
Bay, Florida. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual
liens or releases be filed in the official records.



      (3)   The City shall have the right to collect all delinquent
Assessments in the manner provided by law.  An assessment shall become
delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the due date. The
City or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in
payment of an Assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such Assessment
was due.  Such notice shall state in effect that the City or its agent will
initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property
subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by
law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by
law.



      (4)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable
attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as
described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered
therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the City may be
the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The
City may join in one foreclosure action the collection of Assessments against
any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All
delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for
an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City
and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such
delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result
of such delinquent Assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for
draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or
in addition to, the costs of the action.



      (5)   In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent Assessment and
the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant
to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (a) notice
is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this article, and
(b) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent
Assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the
Assessment Roll to the Tax Collector.



   (C)   Government property. In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act to collect Assessments from Government Property, the City may
elect to use any other method authorized by law or provided by this
Subsection as follows:



      (1)   The City shall provide Assessment bills by first class
mail to the Owner of each affected parcel of Government Property. The bill or
accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of
the Assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to
determine the amount of the Assessment, (3) the number of units contained
within the parcel, (4) the total amount of the parcel's Assessment for the
appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, and
(6) the date on which the Assessment is due.



      (2)   Assessments imposed against Government Property shall be
due on the same date as all other Assessments and, if applicable, shall be
subject to the same discounts for early payment.



      (3)   An Assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid
within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The City shall notify
the Owner of any Government Property that is delinquent in payment of its
Assessment within 60 days from the date such Assessment was due. Such notice
shall state that the City will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate
judicial action to compel payment.



      (4)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable
attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other
action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree
rendered therein. All delinquent owners of Government Property against which
a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an
apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City,
including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent
Assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result of such
delinquent Assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in
addition to, the costs of the action.



      (5)   As an alternative to the foregoing, an Assessment
imposed against Government Property may be collected on the bill for any
utility service provided to such Government Property. The Council may
contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the City.

§ 56.45  ISSUANCE OF OBLIGATIONS.



   (A)   General authority.



      (1)   Upon adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution
imposing Capital Assessments to fund a Local Improvement or at any time

provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time in series, for the
issuance of Obligations to fund the Project Cost thereof.



      (2)   If issued, the principal of and interest on each series
of Obligations shall be payable from Pledged Revenue.  At the option of the
Council, the City may agree, by resolution, to budget and appropriate funds
to make up any deficiency in the reserve account established for the
Obligations or in the payment of the Obligations, from other non-ad valorem
revenue sources.  The Council may also provide, by resolution, for a pledge
of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue sources for the
benefit of the holders of the Obligations.  Any such resolution shall
determine the nature and extent of any pledge of or lien upon proceeds of
such non-ad valorem revenue sources.



   (B)   Terms of the obligations.  If issued, the Obligations shall
be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such
times as may be determined by resolution of the Council, and may be made
redeemable before maturity, at the option of the City, at such price or
prices and under such terms and conditions, all as may be fixed by the
Council.  Said Obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their
issuance.  The Council shall determine by resolution the form of the
Obligations, the manner of executing such Obligations, and shall fix the
denominations of such Obligations, the place or places of payment of the
principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or
outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the
Obligations as it deems appropriate.  The Obligations may be sold at public
or private sale for such price or prices as the Council shall determine by
resolution.  The Obligations may be delivered to any contractor to pay for
construction of the Local Improvements or may be sold in such manner and for
such price as the Council may determine by resolution to be for the best
interests of the City.



   (C)   Variable rate obligations. At the option of the Council,
Obligations may bear interest at a variable rate.



   (D)   Temporary obligations. Prior to the preparation of definitive
Obligations of any series, the Council may, under like restrictions, issue
interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary Obligations,
exchangeable for definitive Obligations when such Obligations have been
executed and are available for delivery.  The Council may also provide for
the replacement of any Obligations which shall become mutilated, destroyed or
lost.  Obligations may be issued without any other proceedings or the
happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings,
conditions or things which are specifically required by this subchapter.



   (E)   Anticipation notes.  In anticipation of the sale of
Obligations, the Council may, by resolution, issue notes and may renew the
same from time to time.  Such notes may be paid from the proceeds of the
Obligations, the proceeds of the Capital Assessments, the proceeds of the
notes and such other legally available money as the Council deems appropriate
by resolution.  Said notes shall mature within five years of their issuance
and shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding the maximum rate provided by
law. The Council may issue Obligations or renewal notes to repay the notes. 
The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the Obligations.



   (F)   Taxing power not pledged. Obligations issued under the
provisions of this subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute a general
obligation or pledge of the full faith and credit of the City within the
meaning of the Constitution of the State of Florida, but such Obligations
shall be payable only from Pledged Revenue in the manner provided herein and
by the resolution authorizing the Obligations.  The issuance of Obligations
under the provisions of this subchapter shall not directly or indirectly
obligate the City to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation
whatever therefor.  No holder of any such Obligations shall ever have the
right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing power on the part of
the City to pay any such Obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce
payment of such Obligations or the interest thereon against any property of
the City, nor shall such Obligations constitute a charge, lien or
encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the City, except the
Pledged Revenue.



   (G)   Trust funds.  The Pledged Revenue received pursuant to the
authority of this subchapter shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held
and applied solely as provided in this subchapter and in the resolution
authorizing issuance of the Obligations.  Such Pledged Revenue may be
invested by the City, or its designee, in the manner provided by the
resolution authorizing issuance of the Obligations.  The Pledged Revenue
upon receipt thereof by the City shall be subject to the lien and pledge of
the holders of any Obligations or any entity other than the City providing
credit enhancement on the Obligations.



   (H)   Remedies of holders.  Any holder of Obligations, except to
the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution
authorizing issuance of the Obligations, may, whether at law or in equity, by
suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all
rights under the laws of the State of Florida or granted hereunder or under
such resolution, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties
required by this part, or by such resolution, to be performed by the City.



   (I)   Refunding obligations. The City may, by resolution of the
Council, issue Obligations to refund any Obligations issued pursuant to this
subchapter, or any other obligations of the City theretofore issued to
finance the Project Cost of a Local Improvement and provide for the rights of
the holders hereof.  Such refunding Obligations may be issued in an amount
sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of, redemption
premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Obligations to be
refunded.  If the issuance of such refunding Obligations results in an
annual Assessment that exceeds the estimated maximum annual Capital
Assessments set forth in the notice provided pursuant to § 56.43(E) hereof,
the Council shall provide notice to the affected property owners and conduct
a public hearing in the manner required by § 56.43 of this subchapter.

to impose assessments pursuant hereto shall be applicable throughout the City.



   (B)   Alternative method.



      (1)   This subchapter shall be deemed to provide an additional
and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and
shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other
laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing
or which may hereafter come into existence. This subchapter, being necessary
for the welfare of the inhabitants of the City, shall be liberally construed
to effect the purposes hereof.



      (2)   Nothing herein shall preclude the Council from directing
and authorizing, by resolution, the combination with each other of (1) any
supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary, or convenient by
the City, (2) any notice required by this subchapter, or (3) any notice
required by law, including the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.

affected person qualifies as an aggrieved or affected person and indicate

(Ord. 2015-22, passed 5-7-15)



§ 59.04  QUASI-JUDICIAL MATTERS.



   (A)   A quasi-judicial matter is a proceeding in which a
quasi-judicial board gives notice and an opportunity to be heard to aggrieved
or adversely affected persons, investigate facts, ascertain the existence of
facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence, draw conclusions from the facts, and
apply the law to the facts. Quasi-judicial matters include, but may not
necessarily be limited to, the following:



      (1)   Site specific rezoning of land which rezoning will have
an impact on a limited number of persons or property owners where the
decision is contingent on fact(s) arrived at from distinct alternatives
presented at a hearing and where the decision can be functionally viewed as
policy application rather than policy setting;



      (2)   Applications for conditional uses or amendments thereto;



      (3)   Hearings on Code Enforcement violations by the Code
Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate for Code Enforcement;



      (4)   Applications for preliminary and final plats;



      (5)   Variances from the application of the Land Development
Code;



      (6)   Appeals from an administrative determination of the
Director of Growth Management or any city official interpreting the
provisions of the Land Development Code; and



      (7)   Hearings on applications for disability or service
retirements before the Board of Trustees of the Palm Bay Police Officers and
Firefighters Pension Fund.



   (B)   For all quasi-judicial matters which require more than one (1)
reading, the first reading shall constitute the quasi-judicial proceeding. 
Once a decision is rendered to grant or grant with conditions the relief
sought by the applicant, then the second reading shall be procedural in
nature with the Quasi-Judicial Body ratifying and affirming its prior
decision.  If new evidence is introduced which, if brought to the attention
of the Quasi-Judicial Body at the first reading, would have had a material
impact on its decision, the Quasi-Judicial Body may re-open the
quasi-judicial hearing.  If the Quasi-Judicial Body re-opens the
quasi-judicial hearing, it shall be scheduled for a date and time certain and
provide notice to all parties.



(Ord. 2015-22, passed 5-7-15)



§ 59.05  PROCEDURES FOR QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.



   (A)   The following is a guideline for conducting quasi-judicial
hearings:



      (1)   All testimony shall be under a sworn oath to tell the
truth. The oath shall be contained on a speaker's card.  All persons wishing
to speak on a quasi-judicial item shall submit a speaker's card containing
said oath to the clerk on duty.



      (2)   The Presider shall call the cases on the agenda but
shall not be bound by the order in which the cases appear on the agenda.



      (3)   The Presider will introduce the case and, if
appropriate, defer to the City Manager (or designee) or City Attorney (or
board counsel) for either an explanation of the matter or the reading of the
ordinance or resolution caption.



      (4)   The Presider shall have the option of determining the
order to expedite the proceedings.  However, all parties shall be provided
the opportunity to present their case. In the event the quasi-judicial matter
constitutes a public hearing, the general order of the presentation of
evidence shall be as follows:



         (a)   The applicant, having the burden of persuasion and
the burden of proof, shall proceed to present its case first;



         (b)   City staff shall then present the opinion of the
City or any other relevant information necessary for the quasi-judicial
body's consideration.



         (c)   Any aggrieved or adversely affected person who has
complied with the notice requirement set forth in § 59.03 shall be heard;



         (d)   Any other person who has taken an oath upon
statement of his/her name and address for the record shall be heard;



         (e)   Closing argument shall then be given by the
applicant.



      (5)   Any natural person or party may represent
himself/herself or may be represented by an attorney.  The statements or
arguments of the attorney are not considered evidence.  The attorney need
not be sworn.



         (a)   In the event any party (other than a corporation
or the City) chooses to be represented by a non-attorney, such party shall
file a written, notarized power of attorney with the clerk at least five (5)
calendar days prior to the hearing stating that the person appearing has the
full power and authority to act on behalf of the party in the matter.



         (b)   A corporation may appear through an officer of the
corporation provided the officer is listed as a current officer of an active
corporation with the Secretary of State and identifies himself/herself in
that corporate capacity.



      (6)   The parties may:



         (a)   Call and examine witnesses;



         (b)   Introduce exhibits;



         (c)   Cross-examine opposing witnesses;



         (d)   Impeach witnesses; and



         (e)   Rebut evidence.



      (7)   The quasi-judicial body shall have the authority to ask
questions of anyone present at the proceedings prior to closing the public
hearing and commencing deliberations.  If during the deliberations, a
question arises which the Quasi-Judicial Body desires to ask, it shall reopen
the public hearing, pose the question and allow both the applicant and the
City the opportunity to respond to the question posed prior to closing the
public hearing again and resuming deliberations.



      (8)   Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Florida
Evidence Code shall apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and
govern said proceedings at all times.



      (9)   All relevant evidence shall be admitted. The
quasi-judicial body may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious
evidence.



      (10)   Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of
either supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, provided it is not
offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but such hearsay evidence
shall not, in and of itself, be considered sufficient to support a finding or
decision unless the evidence would be admissible over objections in any civil
litigation proceeding in a state or federal court in Florida.



      (11)   If, after notice of hearing, a party does not appear,
the hearing may be conducted, and an order entered, in the absence of the
party.



      (12)   The quasi-judicial body shall have the authority to
issue any and all orders to afford the proper relief, and this authority
shall include the authority to grant continuances to a date-certain upon good
cause shown.



      (13)   At the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence
and the taking of testimony, the quasi-judicial body shall close the public
hearing and proceed to deliberate. The quasi-judicial body shall endeavor to
make a determination based upon the appropriate criteria.



      (14)   At the conclusion of the hearing, if and only if relief
is denied to the applicant, a subsequent written order shall be issued to the
applicant by the Quasi-Judicial Body's legal counsel setting forth the
reasons therefor. 



      (15)   The clerk shall retain all of the evidence and
documents submitted into evidence at the hearing. This shall include the
official file in the matter, as well as any document presented at the hearing
or demonstrative exhibit seen by the quasi-judicial body while making its
decision. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit any party from providing
a court reporter for the proceedings. Any party wishing to appeal the
decision of a quasi-judicial body shall have the responsibility to ensure
compliance with Fla. Stat. 286.0105.



(Ord. 2015-22, passed 5-7-15)



§ 59.06  EX PARTE COMMUNICATION.



   (A)   Ex parte communications, while not prohibited, are improper
and greatly discouraged.



   (B)   The following process is hereby established for ex parte
communications with any Local Public Official:



      (1)   Disclosure.



         (a)   The Local Public Official shall disclose the
occurrence of all ex parte communications involving said official that relate
to the quasi-judicial matter pending before the quasi-judicial body on which
the Local Public Official serves.



         (b)   The disclosure shall occur by no later than the
commencement of the final public hearing, or if no formal public hearing is
held, then at the commencement of any hearing at which the final decision
regarding the quasi-judicial matter is made. The Local Public Official shall
disclose the ex parte communication orally or in writing. Any such writing
disclosing the occurrence of the ex parte communication shall be placed in
the official file regarding the pending quasi-judicial matter which file
shall be maintained by the City and shall be made a part of the record.



         (c)   At the time of disclosure, the Local Public
Official shall identify the person, group, or entity with whom the ex parte
communication took place, the general substance of the ex parte
communication, and any matters discussed which are considered by said
official to be material to said member's decision in the pending
quasi-judicial matter.



         (d)   Pursuant to Fla. Stat. 286.0115, the foregoing
process established to disclose ex parte communications with Local Public
Officials hereby removes the presumption of prejudice from ex parte
communications.



   (C)   Commencement. For purposes of defining an ex parte
communication, a quasi-judicial matter shall be said to exist at the time an
application is filed with the City seeking relief that is quasi-judicial in
nature.



   (D)   Site visits. Site visits constitute ex parte information and
are greatly discouraged. Any Local Public Official who conducts a site visit
of any property related to a quasi-judicial matter pending before the
quasi-judicial body on which the official serves must adhere to the
disclosure requirements set forth in paragraph (B)(1) supra, date of the site
visit, and any information obtained by virtue of the site visit.



   (E)   Review of correspondence. Immediately upon review of any mail,
email, or other written correspondence constituting an ex parte 
communication related to a quasi-judicial matter pending before the
quasi-judicial body on which the Local Public Official serves, said document
shall be placed in the official file regarding the pending quasi-judicial
matter.



   (F)   City files. All documents reviewed by a Local Public Official
prior to the final hearing on a pending quasi-judicial matter shall be placed
in the official file regarding said matter. Said documents reviewed by the
Local Public Official prior to the final hearing on a pending quasi-judicial
matter and any disclosure memoranda shall be available for public inspection.
By no later than the commencement of the final public hearing, or if no
formal public hearing is held, then at the commencement of any hearing at
which the final decision regarding the quasi-judicial matter is made, the
clerk shall make said correspondence, mail, written communications, and any
disclosure memoranda placed in the official file a part of the record. All of
the foregoing documents shall be received by the quasi-judicial body as
evidence, with the exception of disclosure memoranda, subject to any
objections interposed by participants at the hearing.

The penalties provided in this section shall be the exclusive penalties

solicitation, the City learns that the certification was erroneous, and upon
investigation determines that the error was willful or intentional on the
part of the employer, the City may, on that basis, exercise any contractual
right to terminate the contract for convenience.

services, programs, opportunities, and initiatives that generate business
development and redevelopment and that foster conditions conducive to job
creation, business growth and expansion, and the creation of a vibrant
economy within a discrete geographic area of the City comprising the City of
Palm Bay Business Improvement District.  It is the intent of the City that
such business development and redevelopment be accomplished pursuant to a
Business Corridor Improvement Plan to be adopted and revised by the City.



   (B)   The creation of a dependent special district meeting the
requirements of Fla. Stat. Ch. 189 represents the best alternative for

property owners, representatives from the business community, and interested
citizens who possess unique knowledge and expertise as to the District and
the requirements for the development, expansion, and revitalization of the
area.  This entity will be responsible for preparing and implementing the

§ 93.24  ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES; NOTICE; HEARING.



   (A)   (1)   Any employee, officer, or resident of the city may
file, in accordance with this section, a complaint alleging the existence of
a public nuisance. Such complaint shall only be for those nuisances
enumerated above in § 93.23 and shall state facts that reasonably tend to
establish the existence of such public nuisance.



      (2)   All complaints shall be filed with the Nuisance
Abatement Coordinator. The Nuisance Abatement Coordinator shall review each
complaint filed to determine whether the facts presented establish the
requisite number of incidents or occurrences required under § 93.23 of this
Code. Where the complaint alleges the requisite number of incidents or
occurrences to establish a nuisance under this subchapter, the Nuisance
Abatement Coordinator shall forward the complaint, with any relevant incident
or arrest reports generated by the Police Department substantiating such
incidents or occurrences or evidencing new or additional incidents or
occurrences, to the City Attorney.



   (B)   (1)   The City Manager shall review all complaints received
from the Nuisance Abatement Coordinator for legal sufficiency. If the City
Manager deems the complaint sufficient under the code to support a probable
finding of the existence of a public nuisance, the Nuisance Abatement
Coordinator shall prepare a courtesy notice of violation to be served, in
accordance with this section, upon the owner of the property in question. The
courtesy notice of violation shall provide the name of the owner of the
premises, the address of the premises where the nuisance has occurred, a
brief statement describing the incidents or occurrences which support the
finding of a public nuisance upon the premises, and recommendations of
remedial action to be taken to abate the public nuisance upon the property.
The owner of the premises shall have ten (10) days from the date of the
notice to contact the Nuisance Abatement Coordinator to indicate what action
will be taken to abate the nuisance upon the premises. Failure of the owner
to receive this notice of violation shall not invalidate any further
proceedings hereunder.



      (2)   If a recurring public nuisance or emergency situation
exists, the Nuisance Abatement Coordinator shall not be required to provide a
courtesy notice of violation, but instead the City Manager may prepare and
serve a statement of violation and notice of hearing as provided below.



   (C)   Should the owner or operator fail to contact the Nuisance
Abatement Coordinator, fail to commit to a course of action designed to abate
the nuisance upon the property, or should there be any further incidents or
occurrences which constitute a nuisance upon the property, a hearing date
shall be scheduled before the Board. Such hearing shall be held no sooner
than ten (10) days after the notice of hearing is sent to the owner of the
place or premises at the owner's last known address. The Nuisance Abatement
Coordinator shall then prepare and serve upon the owner or operator, in
accordance with this subchapter, a statement of violation/notice of hearing
providing the following information:



      (1)   A statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing;



      (2)   A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction
under which the hearing is to be held;



      (3)   A reference to the particular sections of the statutes
and ordinances involved; and



      (4)   A copy of the statement of violation, including all
documentation in support thereof.



   (D)   All notices under this subchapter shall be hand-delivered by
the City Police Department where practical or where not practical or
impossible by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner
of record at the address as it appears in the public records of the County
Property Appraiser's Office. If the notice is returned for any reason, then
service shall be effected by mailing the notice through regular delivery to
the address of the premises and by posting the notice in accordance with Fla.
Stat. Ch. 162. Proof of service shall be by written declaration indicating
the date, time, and manner in which service was made.



   (E)   The City Manager may negotiate stipulated settlement
agreements with a property owner to facilitate the abatement of a public
nuisance. All stipulated agreements shall be reviewed and approved by the
Nuisance Abatement Coordinator and Board prior to being effective.



   (F)   (1)   At the hearing, the Nuisance Abatement Coordinator
shall present evidence before the Board on behalf of the city and has the
burden to prove the existence of a public nuisance by substantial and
competent evidence. The Board may consider any evidence, regarding the
activities alleged in the statement of violation and occurring about the
place or premises, and the owner(s) of the place or premises shall have the
opportunity to appear before the Board, in person and/or through legal
counsel, to present evidence in defense or in mitigation against the
complaint, conduct cross-examination, submit rebuttal evidence, and make
brief opening and/or closing statements. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly
repetitive evidence shall be excluded. All testimony shall be taken under
oath and shall be recorded. Any member of the Board, or Counsel to the Board,
may inquire of any witness testifying before the Board. The Board shall take
testimony of such witnesses as may be called by the respective sides. 
Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall
be observed and govern said proceedings. In addition, the Board may consider
testimony and evidence relating to the general reputation of the place or
premises; and



      (2)   The Board may proceed with a hearing in absentia on the
merits of an alleged public nuisance against any property owner who has been
properly noticed under this subchapter and has failed to appear. Any findings
or orders entered by the Board are valid and binding upon each respondent who
has been properly noticed.



      (3)   The Board in its discretion may continue a hearing to
receive additional evidence, testimony, or for any other reason the Board
deems appropriate.



   (G)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall issue
findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law, and
shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers
granted by Florida Statutes and by this section. The order shall be stated
orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed to the
alleged violator within ten (10) days after the hearing.



   (H)   (1)   If the Board declares a place or premises to be a
public nuisance, it may enter an order immediately prohibiting:



         (a)   The maintaining of the nuisance;



         (b)   The operating or maintaining of the place or
premises;



         (c)   The conduct, operation, or maintenance of any
business or activity on the premises which is conducive to such nuisance; or



         (d)   Any other measures or conditions the Board deems
appropriate to abate a public nuisance.



      (2)   Any other measures or conditions the Board deems
appropriate to abate a public nuisance.



   (I)   This subsection does not restrict the right of any person,
including the city, to proceed under Fla. Stat. § 60.05, against any public
nuisance.



   (J)   If the City proves the existence of a public nuisance or
recurring public nuisance before the Board, the City as the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
associated with the investigation, hearing and prosecution on the public
nuisance through all appellate proceedings, including the costs of recording
any order, notice or agreement.



   (K)   An order of the Board shall expire not more than one (1) year
or as otherwise designated in the order after entry of the order by the
Board. The order may include deadlines or other notice for requiring
compliance by a certain date and that a fine may be imposed in accordance
with this subchapter.



(Ord. 2016-37, passed 6-16-16)



§ 93.25  PENALTIES; FINES; LIENS; RECORDING.



   (A)   The City Manager shall, upon notification by the recording
secretary that an affidavit of noncompliance has been filed by the Nuisance
Abatement Coordinator reflecting that a previous order of the Board has not
been complied with, schedule a hearing before the Board. Upon evidence
establishing that a noncompliance exists, the Board shall enter an order
imposing conditions and any other measures to abate the public nuisance as
provided by this subchapter, including the imposition of a fine.



   (B)   A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first occurrence of a public
nuisance and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a
recurring public nuisance. However, total fines imposed in any action brought
pursuant to this subchapter shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000.00). ln determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Board shall
consider the following factors:



      (1)   The gravity of the public nuisance;



      (2)   Any actions taken by the owner to correct the public
nuisance; and



      (3)   Any previous nuisances maintained or permitted by the
owner.



   (C)   A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded
in the public records of the county, and thereafter shall constitute a lien
against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or
personal property owned by the owner. Upon petition to the circuit court,
such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the
sheriffs of this state, including levy against personal property, but such
order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement
purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this subchapter shall continue to accrue
until the owner comes into compliance or until the judgment is rendered in a
suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs
first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in
favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of a
lien in the same manner as provided under §§ 52.090 and 52.091 of this
Code, or may otherwise seek to foreclose on the lien. However, where the
nuisance abatement action is based on a stolen property nuisance, and is
brought against a property owner operating an establishment where multiple
tenants, on one (1) site, conduct their own retail businesses, the property
owner shall not be subject to a lien against the owner's property or the
prohibition of operation provision if the property owner elects to evict the
business declared to be a nuisance within ninety (90) days after notification
by registered mail to the property owner of a second stolen property
conviction of the tenant. Any lien recorded against real property may be
foreclosed by the city and the owner of such real property shall be liable
for all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, associated with the
recording of all orders and foreclosure.



   (D)   The Board may further bring a complaint under Fla. Stat. §
60.05, seeking a permanent injunction against any nuisance as described in
this subchapter. This section does not restrict the right of any person to
proceed under Fla. Stat. § 60.05, against any public nuisance.

apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   SANITARY NUISANCE.  The commission of any act by an individual,
individuals, organization, or corporation (or the keeping, maintaining,

§ 95.16  DUTY OF CITY TO INVESTIGATE, ABATE NUISANCES.



   Whenever it may seem necessary, the city shall investigate and examine
the condition of any land and/or structure within the city to determine if
any sanitary nuisance exists as herein defined; and after investigation and
examination of such land and/or structure the city determines that a sanitary
nuisance does exist, it shall serve written notice upon the proper party or
parties as defined below, to remove or abate the said nuisance.

   (A)   The city, upon determining the existence of a sanitary
nuisance, as herein defined, shall notify the owner or tenant of the land or
structure and, if known, the individual, organization or corporation
committing, creating, keeping, or maintaining the insanitary condition to

prosecuted to a sale and conveyance of the property involved in said
proceedings as provided by law in suits to foreclose mortgages; or, in the
alternative, the proceedings may be instituted and prosecuted under Fla.
Stat. Ch. 173.

of the State and Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to
persons.



   (B)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any
person discharging to the City of Palm Bay's MS4 in violation of this
subchapter may have their City of Palm Bay's MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City Manager, in
accordance with § 95.33, will notify a violator of the proposed termination
of its City of Palm Bay's MS4 access.



   A person commits an offense, if the person reinstates the City of Palm

      (1)   The City Manager, in accordance with § 95.33, shall be
permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
subchapter. If a person has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the Person shall
make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the City Manager.



      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the City Manager ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
photography, videotaping, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm
water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.



      (3)   The City Manager shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City
Manager to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water
discharge.

to a permitted facility is a violation of this subchapter. A person who is
the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water
associated with Industrial Activity commits an offense, if the person denies
the City Manager reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this subchapter.



      (7)   If the City Manager has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and there is probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the City Manager shall direct the City
Attorney to seek issuance of an administrative search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.

or contamination of storm water, the MS4, State Waters or Waters of the
United States. The person of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the City of Palm Bay's
MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural
BMPs.  Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is,
or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement,
at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. The approved
BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.



(Ord. 2008-37, passed 5-15-08)

suspected release of pollutants, materials or non-stormwater discharges from
that facility or operation that result or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into storm water, the City of Palm Bay's MS4, State
Waters or Waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release so as
to minimize the effects of the discharge. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via Palm Bay Fire Department. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City Manager
in person, by phone or by facsimile no later than the next business day of
the nature, quantity, and time of occurrence of the discharge. Notifications
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the City Manager within three (3) business days of the personal
notification or phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years. Said person shall also take
immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the discharge or spill.

   (A)   The City Council hereby finds and declares that in recent
years and at present an increased number of uninhabitable structures exist,
the maintenance of which is often neglected by the owners thereof. It is
furthermore found and declared by the City Council that said structures often
become open,unsecured, vandalized, or used for illicit purposes by
trespassers, resulting in conditions that are unhealthy, unsafe, unsightly,
and a blight upon the neighborhood and community at large, and that the
demolition of uninhabitable structures will improve the security and quality
of life in general of persons living nearby, will prevent blight and decay,
and will safeguard the public health, safety, morals and welfare. In
particular, and without prejudice to the above findings, it is found and
declared by the City Council that said structures are often used for the
distribution and consumption of narcotics and other controlled substances
thereby constituting a health and safety hazard to the public and community
at large.



   (B)   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to protect the
health, safety, morals, and welfare of all the people of the city by
establishing standards governing the demolition of certain structures;
authorizing and establishing procedures for the demolition of the same and
setting forth a procedure for the enforcement of this chapter by prohibiting
human habitation in and ordering the demolition of structures found
uninhabitable.  This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential
to the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be liberally
construed to effectuate the purposes as stated above.

engaged in, an emergency call for service and who is wearing bunker gear
shall not be required to display his or her security card or badge;



      (4)   Each Department Director may establish for his or her
respective department a policy identifying specific job assignments where the
wearing of a security card poses an unusual risk of harm.



         (a)   Prior to implementation, the individual Department
policy shall be reviewed and approved by the City's Risk Manager.



         (b)   The exceptions to the wearing of a security card
in the individual Department policy shall be narrowly tailored to avoid the
specific hazard and the security card shall be worn at all other times.



         (c)   The exception in the individual Department policy
shall only be allowed where the employee is wearing a uniform that clearly
and distinctly displays the City of Palm Bay logo or name and the employee's

§ 98.05  CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION.



   (A)   In accordance with the parameters set forth in subsection (E),
all contract-employees as defined in this Chapter shall be issued a security
card from the Human Resources Department. The security card shall, at a
minimum, depict on the front of the card the word "CONTRACTOR" in bold print,
provide an accurate picture of the contract-employee, state the
contract-employee's first name, state the name of the contract-employee's
employer and clearly provide an expiration date. The City may also issue
short-term, temporary, identification passes for temporary
contract-employees, as requested by the contractor.



   (B)   The back of every City issued security card, except temporary
passes, shall read: "UNAUTHORIZED POSSESSION OF THIS SECURITY CARD IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE PURSUANT TO ORD. CHAPTER 98." The back of every City issued
security card shall also read: "IF FOUND, DROP IN THE NEAREST MAIL BOX.
POSTMASTER, POSTAGE GUARANTEED. PLEASE DELIVER TO: CITY HALL, 120 MALABAR
ROAD SE, PALM BAY, FL 32907."



   (C)   Prior to being issued a City security card, the contractor
shall complete an application which acknowledges, under penalty of perjury,
that the contract-employee works or provides service for the contractor,
whether for compensation or not, and authorizes the issuance of a City
security card to the contract-employee, which provides limited information
identifying the contract-employee (including, but not limited to, name, date
of birth, address, and either a driver's license number or the number of a
state-issued identification card), and which provides an expiration date
(which shall not be later than the term of the contract).



      (1)   The application shall also attest that the employer has
conducted a background check of the contract-employee and disclose whether,
to the best of employer's knowledge, the contract-employee is currently under
investigation for any criminal act, is engaging in any violation of state or
federal law, and/or is a registered sex offender or predator. The application
shall also be signed by the contract-employee which attests whether he or she
is knowingly under investigation for any criminal act, is engaging in any
violation of state or federal law, and/or is a registered sex offender or
predator.



      (2)   The attestations contained in subsection (C)(1), above,
shall constitute a continuing obligation on the part of the employer and the
contract-employee and, should the contract-employee's status changes which
makes him or her enter one of the above categories, such information shall be
disclosed to the City's Human Resources Department in writing on the next
regular business day of the City.



      (3)   In the event a contract-employee is, or becomes, a
person under investigation for a criminal offense, a person in violation of a
criminal law, or a registered sex offender or predator, such fact shall not
automatically exclude such contract-employee from service in or to the City.
The information shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the
nature of the employment. The City reserves the right, in its sole and
exclusive discretion, to reject any contract-employee based upon any lawful
reason.



   (D)   The City shall retain the right to verify the information
contained on the application and shall require the contract-employee to
present his or her driver's license or state-issued identification card prior
to sitting for a photograph or being issued a City security card. The City
shall retain the right to request fingerprints of the contract-employee
and/or conduct a background investigation if it is deemed necessary, in the
sole discretion of the City.



   (E)   Except as provided for herein, this Chapter shall apply to all
those who are engaged in a business relationship with the City, regardless of
whether such business arrangement is pursuant to a written contract.



      (1)   SERVICE PROVIDER EXCEPTION. The provisions of this
Chapter do not apply to those who provide a service to the City, where the
City is the consumer of such service and the contractor is repairing,
maintaining or installing its equipment which has been leased or sold to the
City (i.e., a repairman coming into a City office to repair a copy machine,
Waste Management emptying dumpsters, etc.) and the contract-employee has no
significant contact with the public, regardless of the existence of a
contract or other business arrangement.



      (2)   DELIVERY PERSON EXCEPTION. The provisions of this
Chapter do not apply to those who provide a service to the City where the
City is a recipient of routine deliveries (i.e., the FedEx driver) regardless
of the existence of a contract or other business arrangement.



      (3)   LARGE EMPLOYER EXCEPTION. The provisions of this Chapter
do not apply to the employees of any contractor whose business has more than
five hundred (500) employees and which can document at least one other
governmental client which is a county, a county school board, a sheriff's
office, a municipality with a population of more than 70,000 persons, the
State of Florida or an agency thereof (i.e., Water Management District,
County Housing Authority, etc.) or the Federal Government or an agency
thereof.



         (a)   To qualify for this exemption, the contractor
shall issue its own identification cards to its employees, which complies
with the minimum requirements set forth in subsection (A), above (except for
the word "CONTRACTOR" and the expiration date). A determination as to whether
the company-issued identification card is sufficient shall be in the sole
discretion of the City.



         (b)   The purpose of this exemption is that any business
of this size, with other governmental contracts, is presumed by the City to
have screened its employees and verified that they are not a danger to the
citizens of the City, and the City is confident that the large employer's
identification card is sufficient to inform the public of the worker's
identity.



         (c)   In the event a business qualifying for the
exemption set forth herein is or becomes, in the sole discretion of the City
Council, suspected of not maintaining adequate employee screening to protect
the citizens of the City, the Council may, by motion and a majority vote,
revoke the "large employer exemption" for such contractor.



         (d)   In the event a "large employer exemption" is not
granted or is revoked for any particular contractor, that contractor shall
have no recourse against the City and must comply with the provisions of this
Chapter and obtain City issued security cards for each of its employees.



      (4)   CHARTER SCHOOL EXCEPTION.  The provisions of this
Chapter do not apply to the employees of Charter Schools USA which is the
long-term provider of education services to the Palm Bay Municipal Charter
School Authority, provided that such employees:



         (a)   Have completed the required background
investigation required by Fla. Stat. § 1012.465 (the Jessica Lunsford Act);
and



         (b)   Possess and display a photo identification card
issued by Charter Schools USA.



      (5)   The City's Risk Manager may authorize narrow exceptions
for a contractor which identifies specific job assignment where the wearing
of a security card poses an unusual risk of harm, provided all of the
following are met:



         (a)   The contract-employee must possess a City issued
security card on his or her person at all times and must display it at all
times that he or she is not actively engaged in the identified high-risk job
assignment;



         (b)   The contract-employee must be wearing a uniform or
a shirt that identifies the name of his or her employer; and



         (c)   The excepted high-risk job assignment must not
involve any significant public contact.



   (F)   Reference to a "City issued security card" within this Chapter
shall apply equally whether the contract-employee is issued a security card
from the City or an identification card from his or her company employer
pursuant to subsection (E)(3), above.



   (G)   The following are terms and conditions applicable to
contract-employees:



      (1)   A contract-employee shall have the City issued security
card attached to his or her person, located on the front-side of such
contract-employee at the beltline or above, with the front of the card
plainly visible. Such contract-employee shall not hide the card or otherwise
make it less than plainly visible at any time, especially when a citizen is
attempting to see the picture and information contained thereupon. The
contract-employee shall present the security card for inspection to any
individual identifying themselves as a City employee and displaying his or
her own City issued security card.



      (2)   A contract-employee shall surrender his or her City
issued security card upon resigning from his or her employment or otherwise
ceasing to regularly work in the City of Palm Bay. The contractor shall
remain responsible for ensuring that its employees surrender such City issued
security card upon separation from service and will deliver such card to the
Human Resources Department.



      (3)   In the event a contract-employee loses his or her City
issued security card, it shall be reported immediately to the Human Resources
Department. The contract-employee will cooperate in documenting the lost card
including, but not limited to, the filing of a police report. A replacement
City issued security card will be provided at no cost to the contractor or
the contract-employee for the first replacement card within a two-year
period. Subsequent replacement cards within that time period for the same
contract-employee may involve a fee to be established by the City.



      (4)   In the event a contract-employee is at his or her
worksite without a City issued security card, the contract-employee may be
directed by any law enforcement officer to immediately leave the worksite.
Failure of the contract-employee to leave the worksite upon direction of a
law enforcement officer shall constitute a criminal offense punishable as set
forth in § 10.99.



      (5)   It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that the
contracted work gets completed as required by the contract. The
contract-employee shall not return to the worksite without a City issued
security card.



   (H)   A contractor shall be fully and completely responsible to
ensure that any subcontractor engaged to fulfill the terms of the contract
fully complies with the provisions of this Chapter.



   (I)   Any contractor (including any subcontractor) who knowingly
violates the provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty of a criminal offense
punishable as set forth in § 10.99.



   (J)   The provisions of this Chapter shall not be enforced upon a
declaration pursuant to Chapter 53, and shall automatically be suspended
during the aftermath of the emergency until the next regularly scheduled City
Council meeting where business is transacted. This Chapter shall remain
suspended subsequent to that Council meeting if the suspension is approved by
a motion and an affirmative vote of a majority of the Council members present.



   (K)   It is the intention of the City Council that this Chapter
apply equally to current contractors as well as future contractors. This
Chapter shall be incorporated by reference in all future contracts approved
by the City.

CHAPTER 100: FERTILIZER USE ON URBAN LANDSCAPE



Section

   100.02   Definitions



   100.03   Applicability

§ 100.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   This ordinance regulates and promotes the proper use of
fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and
institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing
requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies
allowable fertilizer application rates and methods; fertilizer-free zones; 
low maintenance  zones;  and exemptions.



   (B)   This ordinance requires the use of Best Management Practices
which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary
and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of
fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and
on Palm Bay's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, ponds, canals,
creeks, estuaries and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies
are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and
economic well-being of Palm Bay residents and the health of the public.
Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood
attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater and drainage
conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen
contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat
quality.

Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance."



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.02  FINDINGS, INTENT AND SCOPE.



   (A)   The city hereby makes and declares the following findings and
declares its legislative intent as follows:



      (1)   The public rights-of-way within the City of Palm Bay are
a unique and physically limited resource and important amenity that are
critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the city.



      (2)   The demand for telecommunications services has grown
exponentially in recent years, requiring the continual upgrading of
telecommunications equipment and services to satisfy such demand.



      (3)   The placement of telecommunications equipment and
facilities in the public rights-of-way to satisfy the demand for
telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the
city's responsibility to manage its public rights-of-way.



      (4)   The public rights-of-way must be managed and controlled
in a manner that enhances the health, safety and general welfare of the city
and its citizens.



      (5)   The use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way by
providers of communications services must be subject to regulation which can
ensure minimal inconvenience to the public, coordinate users, maximize
available space, reduce maintenance and costs to the public, and facilitate
entry of an optimal number of providers of cable, telecommunications, and
other services in the public interest.



      (6)   Fla. Stat. § 166.041 provides for procedures for
adoption of an ordinance which is a regulation of general and permanent
nature and enforceable as local law.



      (7)   Fla. Stat. § 337.401 provides that because federal and
state law require the nondiscriminatory treatment of providers of
telecommunications services and because of the desire to promote competition
among providers of communications services, it is the intent of the Florida
Legislature that municipalities and counties treat providers of
communications services in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral
manner when imposing rules or regulations governing the placement or
maintenance of communications facilities in the public roads or rights-of-way.



      (8)   The city finds that, to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, it is necessary to (i) provide for the placement
or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way
within the city limits, (ii) adopt and administer reasonable rules,
regulations and general conditions not inconsistent with applicable state and
federal law, (iii) manage the placement and maintenance of communications
facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services
providers, (iv) minimize disruption to the public rights-of-way, and (v)
require the restoration of the public rights-of-way to original condition.



      (9)   The city's intent is that these rules and regulations
must be generally applicable to all providers of communications services and,
notwithstanding any other law, may not require a provider of communications
services to apply for or enter into an individual license, franchise, or
other agreement with the city as a condition of placing or maintaining
communications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way.



      (10)   It is also the city's intent to exercise the city's
retained authority to regulate and manage the city's roads and rights-of-way
in exercising its police power over communications services providers'
placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way in a non
discriminatory and competitively neutral manner.



   (B)   This chapter shall apply to any public or private entity who
seeks to construct, place, install, maintain or operate a communications
system or facilities, as such terms are defined herein, in the public
rights-of-way, unless otherwise exempt by operation of applicable state or
federal law. This chapter shall equally apply to a city owned or controlled
communications system except to the extent such facilities are utilized on an
internal, non- commercial basis by the city or any of its agencies,
departments or bureaus.

register with the city in accordance with this § 101.04. Subject to the
provisions prescribed in this chapter, a communications services provider
that has properly registered may apply for development permits to place or
maintain a communications system or facilities in the public rights-of-way.



   (A)   Every communications services provider that desires to place
or maintain communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, including
any pass-through facilities, shall register with the public works director or
his designee's office and shall submit the following information and
documentation:



      (1)    the name of the applicant under which it will transact
business in the city and, if different, in the State of Florida; and



      (2)   the address and telephone number of the applicant's
principal place of business in the State of Florida and any branch office
located in the city or, if none, the name, address and telephone number of
the applicant's national headquarters and its registered agent in Florida; and



      (3)   the name, address and telephone number of the
applicant's primary contact person and the person to contact in case of an
emergency; and



      (4)   the type of communications services that the applicant
intends to provide within the corporate limits of the city (if more than one,
state all that apply), or, if none, state that the applicant is a
pass-through provider or is intending only to place and maintain pass through
facilities, as the case may be; and



      (5)   for registrations submitted on or after October 1, 2017,
a copy of both the applicant's resale certificate and certificate of
registration issued by the Florida Department of Revenue to engage in the
business of providing communications services in the State of Florida; and



      (6)   a copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization,
public convenience and necessity or other similar certification issued by the
Florida Public Service Council; and



      (7)   the number of the applicant's certificate of
authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the
Florida Public Service Council, the Department, the FCC, or other Federal
authority, if any; and

lieu of paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) above, the applicant shall provide a
certified copy of the certificate or license issued by the Florida Department
of State, or other appropriate state agency or department, authorizing the
company to do business in the State of Florida; and



      (9)   evidence of the applicant's insurance coverage as
required under this chapter.



   (B)   The city shall review the information submitted by the
applicant. Such review shall be by the public works director or his or her
designee. If it is found that the applicant complied with the requirements in
§ 101.04(A) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall
notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the
city determines that the applicant is not in compliance, the city shall
notify the applicant in writing of the non-effectiveness and denial of
registration and the reasons therefor. The city shall so reply to an
applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of the registration and
required information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness and denial of
registration shall not preclude an applicant from reapplying or filing
subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section.



   (C)   An effective registration does not, and shall not be construed
to, convey equitable or legal title in the public rights-of-way to any
communications services provider. Registration under this ordinance governs
only the placement or maintenance of a communications system or
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. Other ordinances,
codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public
rights-of-way of facilities that are not part of a communications system.
Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating
its facilities on those facilities or property belonging to the city or
another person. Registration does not excuse a communications services
provider from complying with all other applicable city ordinances, codes or
regulations, including the rules, regulations and general conditions set
forth in this chapter.



   (D)   A communications services provider may cancel a registration
upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or
maintain a communications system or any communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way and will no longer have a need to apply for development
permits to perform construction or other work in the public rights-of-way. A
communications services provider cannot cancel a registration if it intends
to continue placing or maintaining a communications system or any
communications facilities in the public rights- of-way.



   (E)   Registration, in and of itself, does not establish a right to
place or maintain or a priority for the placement or maintenance of a
communications system or any facility in the public rights-of-way, but shall
establish for the communications services provider a right to apply for a
development permit from the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any
future amendment to or replacement of this chapter and further subject to any
additional city ordinances, as well as any State or Federal laws that may be
enacted. Registration does not excuse or exempt a communications services
provider from having to obtain on occupational license from the city in
accordance with the City Code.



   (F)   A communications services provider shall renew its
registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance
with the registration requirements in this chapter, except that any
communications services provider that initially registers during the even
numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately
preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew its
registration until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of
any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection
(1), a communications services provider shall provide updated information to
the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed,
the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a
registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional
development permits until the communications services provider has complied
with the registration requirements of this chapter.



   (G)   In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or
regulations, a development permit is required for a communications services
provider to place or maintain a communications facility in the public
rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining
such a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, all permitting
requirements shall apply, including the requirement to pay for any such
permits unless otherwise provided by resolution or ordinance of the city. A
permit may be obtained by or on behalf of the communications services
provider having an effective registration if all permitting requirements of
the city and other provisions of this chapter are met.



   (H)   A reseller, which by definition does not place or maintain
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, is not required to
register with the city.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.05  NOTICE OF TRANSFER, SALE OR ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS.



   If a communications services provider transfers, sells or assigns its
system or any facilities located in the public rights-of-way incident to a
transfer, sale or assignment of the communications services provider's
assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with
the provisions set forth in this chapter. Written notice of any such
transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by the communications services
provider to the city within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such
transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not
currently registered with the city, then the transferee, buyer or assignee
must register as provided in § 101.04 within sixty (60) days of the
effective date of such transfer, sale or assignment. If any applications for
development permits are pending under the communications services provider's

assignment, then the city shall consider the transferee, buyer or assignee as
the new applicant unless otherwise notified by the communications services
provider.

communications system or any communications facility in the public
rights-of-way, and under additional authority granted pursuant to Fla. Stat.
Ch. 337, the city hereby imposes the following rules, regulations and general
conditions. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter 101, these rules,
regulations and general conditions shall apply to all communications services
providers, including those that are pass-through providers irrespective of
whether they place and maintain only conduit, dark fiber or pass-through
facilities.



   (A)   Rules on utilization of the public rights-of-way.



      (1)   Compliance with laws. A communications services provider
shall at all times be in full compliance with and abide by all applicable
Federal, State and local laws, codes and regulations in placing or
maintaining a communications system and facilities in the public
rights-of-way.



      (2)   Due care. A communications services provider shall use
and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public
rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site
areas.



      (3)   Permits. A communications services provider shall not
commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public
rights-of-way until all applicable permits have been issued by the city and
other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term
"emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety
or general welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a
pre-existing service. The communications services provider shall provide
prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications
facility in the public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall,
after-the-fact, be required to submit plans and record drawings and as-built
surveys, if required by the public works director or his designee, showing
the placement or relocation of a communications facility undertaken in
connection with the emergency.



      (4)   Application for development permit. Prior to the

communications system or facility in the public rights-of-way, the city has
the right to first review and consider and the communications services
provider shall provide all of the following:



         (a)   The expected dates and times when the facility
will be installed and the estimated time needed for construction and
placement of the proposed facility;



         (b)   The location of the proposed facility, the public
rights-of-way affected and a description of the facility, including the type
of facility (e.g. conduit, fiber, twisted pair, etc.), the number of fibers
or other cable being installed, and the approximate size of the facility
(e.g. length, height, width and diameter); and



         (c)   Plans, drawings, photographs, and schematics
(including cross section layout) prepared by a qualified engineer or
technician showing where the facility is proposed to be located in the public
rights-of-way and showing any known communications facilities or utility
facilities in such public rights-of-way.



      (5)   Revised plans. If the plans or drawings submitted
showing the proposed location for installation of the facility in the public
rights-of-way require revision for any reason prior to commencing
construction, the communications services provider shall promptly submit
revised plans and drawings to the public works director or his designee.



      (6)   Power to restrict area. To the extent not otherwise
prohibited by State or Federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit
or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within
a particular area of the public rights-of way and deny the issuance of a
development permit.



      (7)   Limited purpose of development permit. A development
permit issued by the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain
activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this chapter, and does
not create any property right or other vested interest, or grant authority to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public
rights-of-way. Development permits shall be granted only for specific routes
or locations in the public rights-of-way and for such term as described in
the permit. The city's issuance of a development permit shall not be
construed as a warranty that the placement of any communications facility is
in compliance with applicable codes, regulations or laws.



      (8)   Responsibility for contractors. Every communications
services provider that is registered with the city shall be liable for the
actions of contractor(s) hired by them to perform the placement or
maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way and shall be
responsible for making sure that such contractor meets and complies fully
with the rules, regulations and general conditions set forth in this chapter.



   (B)   Regulations on the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities.



      (1)   Provision and form of record drawings and as-built
surveys. Within forty-five (45) days after completion of any placement or
maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way, the
communications services provider shall provide the city with record drawings
showing the final location of such facility in the public rights-of-way. Upon
request by the public works director or his designee, the communications
services provider shall also provide the city with as-built surveys within
forty-five (45) days after completion of any placement or maintenance of a
communications facility in the public rights-of-way. The record drawings and
as-built surveys shall be provided to the city at no cost.



      (2)   Production and filing of as-builts. Every communications
services provider that is registered with the city shall produce and keep on
file at its principal place of business an accurate and complete set of
as-builts of all facilities placed and maintained in the public
rights-of-way. The location and identification of facilities and the
production of as-builts shall be at the sole expense of the communications
services provider. Within thirty (30) days of any written request by the
public works director or his designee, the communications services provider
must provide to the city, at no cost, copies of complete sets of as-builts
for the indicated public rights-of-way. The failure of the communications
services provider to produce, keep on file, or provide to the city as-builts
as required under this chapter is sufficient grounds for the city to deny the
issuance of development permits in the future.



      (3)   Removal of facilities placed without permit. Any
communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way by the
communications services provider without first having obtained the required
development permits shall be removed within thirty (30) days of written
notice by the city to remove the same and in default of compliance with such
notice, such facilities may be removed by order of the public works director
or his designee and the cost of removal shall be borne and paid by the
communications services provider upon demand.



      (4)   Underground. The placement or maintenance of all
communications facilities shall be underground unless otherwise approved in
writing by the public works director or his designee. Communications
facilities shall be placed between the property line and the curb line of all
streets and avenues and shall not be within the roadway or the roadway
recovery area unless specifically approved in writing by the public works
director or his designee. All communications facilities shall have consistent
alignment parallel with the edge of pavement, a thirty-six inch (36") depth
of cover for and shall have two feet (2') of horizontal clearance from other
underground utilities and their appurtenances. Where approved by the public
works director or his designee, facilities to be placed in the street shall
be laid according to the permanent grade of the street and at a depth below
the surface of the permanent grade as each is determined by the public works
director or his designee.



      (5)   Above-ground approval. The placement or maintenance of
facilities above-ground, including new poles and aerial wires, is subject to
written approval by the public works director or his designee. Attachment to
any pole or other above-ground structure must be pursuant to a valid and
effective pole attachment agreement or similar instrument. Location on any
pole or other above-ground structure shall not be considered a vested
interest of the communications services provider and such poles or
structures, if owned by the communications services provider, shall be
removed or modified by the communications services provider at its own
expense whenever the city or other governmental authority determines that the
public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The lowest placement of any
communications facility on any pole or other above-ground structure in the
public rights-of-way shall not be less than eighteen (18) feet from the
ground. The communications services provider shall, at such time as the
electric utility facilities or other communica tions facilities are placed
underground or are required by the city to be placed underground,
concurrently place its communications facilities underground without cost to
the city.



      (6)    New poles or above-ground structures. The placing of
any new pole or other above-ground structure to support communications
facilities is subject to the approval of the public works director or his
designee and shall be done under the supervision of the public works director
or his designee. No such pole or other above-ground structure shall be placed
in any gutter or drainage area and must be behind the curb to avoid damage to
any sidewalk. In areas of the city where either electric utility wires or
other communications facilities are above ground and such facilities are
moved, either voluntarily or at the direction of the city, to a new pole or
other above-ground structure, the communications services provider shall
likewise move all its above-ground facilities on such poles or structures to
such new pole or structure within thirty (30) days after receipt of written
notice from either the city or the owner of the new pole or structure,
without cost to the city.



      (7)   Placement and maintenance standards. The placement or
maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be
performed in accordance with standards and requirements of the following, as
is applicable and as each is in force at the time of the respective placement
or maintenance of a communications system or facility:



         (a)   the Florida Department of Transportation Utilities
Accommodation Guide;



         (b)   the State of Florida Manual of Uniform Minimum
Standards for Design Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways;



         (c)   the Trench Safety Act (Fla. Stat. Ch. 553);



         (d)   the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and
Safety Act (Fla. Stat. Ch. 556);



         (e)   the National Electrical Code or the ANSI National
Electrical Safety Code; and



         (f)   the "Safety Rules for the Installation and
Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication Lines" established by the
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Standards of the United States.



      (8)   Sunshine State One-Call. Every communications services
provider shall utilize, and if permissible, maintain membership in the
utility notification one call system administered by Sunshine State One-Call
of Florida, Inc.



      (9)   Safety and minimal interference. All placement and
maintenance of communication facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be
subject to the City Code and other regulations of the city pertaining
thereto, and shall be performed with the least possible interference with the
use and appearance of the public rights-of-way and the rights and reasonable
convenience of the property owners who abut or adjoin the public
rights-of-way and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Florida
Department of Transportation. The communications services provider shall at
all times employ reasonable care and use commonly accepted methods and
devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage or injury or be a nuisance to the public. Suitable barricades, flags,
lights, flares, or other devices shall be used at such times and places as
are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. All
placement and maintenance shall be done in such a manner as to minimize to
the greatest extent any interference with the usual travel on such public
rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., microtunneling and
horizontal directional drilling techniques) for the installation of
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint
trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly
encouraged, and should be employed wherever and whenever feasible.



      (10)   Correction of harmful conditions. If, at any time, the
city or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that
any communications facility is, or has caused a condition that is, harmful to
the health, safety or general welfare of any person, then the communications
services provider shall, at its own expense, promptly correct or eliminate
all such facilities and conditions. In an emergency, as determined by the
public works director or his designee, when the communications services
provider is not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary
immediate repairs to any communications facility that is damaged or
malfunctioning, or has caused a sunken area or other condition and, in the
public works director or his designee's sole discretion, is deemed a threat
to public safety, then the city, when apprised of such an emergency, shall
have the right to remove, make repairs to or eliminate same with the total
cost being charged to and paid for by the communications services provider
upon demand.



      (11)   Remedy of hazardous conditions. If, at any time, a
condition exists that the city or other authority of competent jurisdiction
reasonably determines is an emergency that is potentially hazardous or life
threatening to any person or is a threat to the health or safety of the
general public, and to remedy such condition the city or other authority of
competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that a communications services
provider must temporarily relocate or temporarily shut off service or
transmissions through a specific facility, then the city, as an appropriate
exercise of its police powers, may order the communications services provider
to immediately perform such temporary relocation or shut off until the
condition has been remedied, and to do so at its own expense and without
liability to or recourse against the city. In such an emergency, when the
communications services provider is not immediately available or is unable to
provide the necessary immediate relocation or shut off of the specific
communications facility, then the city shall have the right to perform, or
cause to be performed, such temporary relocation or shut off until the
condition has been remedied with the total cost being charged to and paid for
by the communications services provider upon demand.



      (12)   Interference with other facilities. A communications
services provider shall not, in violation of any applicable laws or
regulatory standards, design, place or maintain its communications facilities
in a manner that will interfere with the signals or facilities of any
municipal or county police, fire or rescue department, the facilities of any
public utility, or the communications facilities of another communications
service provider, including any cable service provider.



      (13)   Relocation or removal of facilities. Except in cases of
emergency, a communications services provider, at its own expense, shall:



         (a)   Upon thirty (30) days written notice, relocate or
remove, as specified in said notice, its communications facility in the event
the city finds that the particular facility is unreasonably interfering in
some way with the convenient, safe or continuous use, or the maintenance,
improvement, extension or expansion of any public rights-of-way. The city
shall provide the communications services provider with a notice and order as
provided for in Fla. Stat. § 337.404, or any subsequently enacted law of the
State of Florida, in the event it charges the communications services
provider for the cost and expense of relocating or removing such facility
pursuant to this paragraph.



         (b)   Within a reasonable period of time from the date
of written notice from the city, but not more than one hundred twenty (120)
days thereafter, relocate or remove, as specified in said notice, its
communications facility in the event the public works director or his
designee determines it necessary for the construction, completion, repair,
relocation or maintenance of a city project, because the particular
communications facility is interfering with or adversely affecting the proper
operation of street light poles, traffic signals, or any communications
system belonging to the city or an agency thereof or because the particular
communications facility is interfering with the signals or facilities of the
Palm Bay Police Department, Palm Bay Fire Department, or the City of Palm Bay
Utilities Department.  In the event the city issues any such written notice
to the communications services provider pursuant to this paragraph, and the
communications services provider fails to cause the aforementioned relocation
or removal as required herein, the city shall be entitled to relocate or
remove such facilities without further notice to the communications services
provider and the total cost and expense shall be charged to the
communications services provider.



      (14)   Temporary raising or lowering of facilities. A
communications services provider, upon request of any person holding a
validly issued building or moving permit from the city to temporarily
encroach on or perform moving operations in or across the public
rights-of-way, shall temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities
to accommodate such temporary encroachment or move. The expense of such
temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person
requesting the same, and the communications services provider shall have the
authority to require such payment in advance. The communications services
provider shall be given not less than twenty (20) days advance written notice
from such person to arrange for the temporary relocation, which notice must
detail the time and location of the permitted activity, and not less than
twenty-four (24) hours advance notice from the permit holder advising of the
actual operation. The city is not subject to, nor shall it be liable for, any
such expense or notice requirement for the moving of houses or structures
performed by the city or its contractors.



      (15)   Coordination. In an effort to minimize the adverse
impact on the public rights-of- way and other municipal improvements, a
communications services provider may be required by the public works director
or his designee to coordinate the placement or maintenance of its facilities
with any work, construction, installation in or repairs of the subject public
rights-of-way or other facilities therein that is occurring or is scheduled
to occur within a reasonable time from application for a development permit
as determined by the public works director or his designee. Every
communications services provider shall make space in its trench and/or
conduit within the public rights-of-way available to other providers
consistent with the federal requirements of 47 U.S.C. 224. Every
communications services provider shall utilize existing conduits, pathways
and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not place or maintain any
new, different, or additional poles, conduits, pathways or other facilities,
whether in the public rights-of-way or on privately-owned property, until
written approval is obtained from the city or other appropriate governmental
authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner.



      (16)   Co-location and joint use. A communications services
provider, in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the useful life of
the public rights-of-way, shall, whenever possible, enter into joint use
agreements with the city and other parties who have registered with, or who
are expressly authorized by, the city to use its public rights-of-way;
provided that the terms of such agreements are satisfactory to the
communications services provider. Nothing herein contained shall mandate that
the communications services provider enter into joint use agreements with
parties other than the city or an agency of the city. However, prior to
placement of any new or additional underground conduit in the public
rights-of-way, a communications services provider is required to certify in
writing to the public works director or his designee that it has made
appropriate inquiry to all existing utilities and other entities possessing a
right to occupy the public rights-of-way as to the availability of existing
or planned conduit that the particular communications services provider could
reasonably utilize to meet its needs, and that no such conduit is available
or planned at a reasonable cost by any other entity on the time schedule
reasonably needed. The communications services provider shall not be
permitted to perform any placement or maintenance of facilities in those
segments of the public rights-of-way where there exists vacant or available
conduit, dark fiber or surplus fiber owned by the city, an agency of the city
or another governmental body which is or, through a reasonable amount of
effort and expense, can be made compatible with the communications services
provider's system or network. Under such circumstances the communications
services provider shall have the opportunity to enter into a use agreement or
lease arrangement with the city or an agency of the city at or below
reasonable and prevailing market rates for such conduit or fiber or, where
owned by another governmental body, shall, in good faith, first exhaust all
means of obtaining use of such conduit or fiber before applying for a
development permit from the city.



      (17)   Maintenance-of-Traffic. In the event that placement or
maintenance of communications facilities conducted by the communications
services provider requires streets or traffic lanes to be closed or
obstructed, the communications services provider must, pursuant to the
requirements of existing or subsequently enacted city ordinances, obtain all
necessary permits from city, and shall obtain approval of its
maintenance-of-traffic plan from the public works director or his designee.



      (18)   Restoration of the public rights-of-way. After
completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in
the public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, the Communications services
provider shall, at its own expense and in a manner reasonably acceptable to
the city, restore without delay the public rights-of-way so disturbed to its
original condition immediately prior to the placement or maintenance work. If
the communications services provider fails to make such restoration within
thirty (30) days following the completion of such placement or maintenance,
the city may perform such restoration and charge the costs of the restoration
to the communications services provider in accordance with Fla. Stat. §
337.402, as it may be amended. The communications services provider shall, to
the satisfaction of the public works director or his designee, maintain and
correct any restorations made pursuant hereto for a period of twelve (12)
months following the date of its completion. Failure to comply with this
subsection shall be deemed sufficient grounds for denial of any future
development permits for the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities.



   (C)   General conditions on the utilization of the public
rights-of-way and the placement or maintenance of communications facilities.



      (1)   City not liable. Except for acts of willful misconduct
or gross negligence and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither
the city nor its officials, boards, Councils, consultants, agents, employees
or independent contractors shall have any liability to the communications
services provider for any claims for any damages, costs, expenses or losses
resulting from the city's breakage, removal, alteration or relocation of any
facilities of any communications services provider which arose out of or in
connection with any emergency or disaster situation or was, in the sole
discretion of the public works director or his designee, deemed necessary to
facilitate any public works project, public improvement, alteration of a city
structure, change in the grade or line of any public rights-of-way, or the
elimination, abandonment or closure of any public rights-of-way or was found
by City Council to be in the best interest of the health, safety or general
welfare of the public; nor shall any charge be made by the communications
services provider against the city for any damages, costs, expenses or losses
related thereto.



      (2)   No exemption from permits. Nothing in this chapter shall
exempt any communications services provider from obtaining development
permits for work done within the public rights-of-way.



      (3)   Subject to police powers. The rights of the
communications services provider shall be subject to all lawful exercise of
police power by the city, and to such other reasonable regulation of the
public rights-of-way as the city shall hereafter by resolution or ordinance
provide in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the
public. Any inconsistency or ambiguity between the provisions of this Chapter
101 and any lawful exercise of the city's police power shall be resolved in
favor of the latter.



      (4)   City inspection. The city shall have the right to make
such inspections of a communications system or facilities placed or
maintained in the public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure
compliance with this chapter. This chapter shall not be construed to create
or hold the city responsible or liable for any damage to persons or property
by reason of any inspection by the city of the placement or maintenance of a
communications system or facility as authorized herein or failure by the city
to so inspect.



      (5)   Access to manholes. The city, in the proper exercise of
its municipal powers and duties with respect to the public rights-of-way,
shall have access at any time to all hand holes and manholes in the city
belonging to a communications services provider. Before accessing any
manhole, the city will make a reasonable good faith effort to provide the
communications services provider prior notice to afford an opportunity to
have trained personnel present, unless determined by the city to be an
emergency situation.



      (6)   Compatibility, capacity and interference issues. To
properly manage and control the use of the public rights-of-way, and to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, the city, in
its legislative and regulatory role, shall be the final authority on
permitting a communications system or facility to be placed in the public
rights-of-way and shall exercise such authority in a non-discriminatory
manner. It shall be in the sole discretion of the City Attorney whether an
easement is compatible with or allows for its use by a communications system
or facility. It shall be in the sole discretion of the public works director
or his designee, based on the nature, design, size, configuration or proposed
location of any communications system or facility, whether there is
sufficient capacity in a particular section of the public rights-of-way or
whether such system or facility will interfere with the facilities or
equipment of any municipality, county, public utility, cable operator, or
other communications service provider.



      (7)   No warranty of fitness or suitability. The city makes no
express or implied warranties or representations regarding the fitness,
suitability, or availability of the public rights-of-way for any
communications system or facility or its right to authorize the placement or
maintenance of any communications system or facility in the public
rights-of-way. Any performance of work, costs incurred or services rendered
by a communications services provider shall be at such provider's sole risk.
Nothing in this chapter shall affect the city's authority to acquire or add
public rights-of-way, or to vacate or abandon public rights-of-way as
provided for in the City Code or applicable law. The city makes no express or
implied warranties or representations regarding the availability of any
acquired, added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for a
communications system or facility.



      (8)   Annexations. Upon the annexation of any territory to the
City of Palm Bay, the provisions of this chapter and the rules, regulations
and general conditions contained herein shall extend to the territories so
annexed; and all facilities placed, maintained, owned or operated by any
communications services provider extending into or already located in the
public rights-of-way of the territory so annexed, shall thereafter be subject
to all terms hereof, as the same may be amended from time to time.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.07  DUTY TO NOTIFY CITY OF RESELLERS; CONDITIONAL USE OF PUBLIC
RIGHTS-OF-WAY.



   Within thirty (30) days of any registered communications services
provider using its facilities to carry the communication services of any
reseller, such communications services provider shall notify the city of the
name and address of such reseller. A reseller's lease, interconnection or
other use of facilities belonging to a communications services provider duly
registered in accordance with § 101.04 and properly permitted to place or
maintain its facilities in the public rights-of-way, does not, and shall not,
afford such reseller any right, claim or cause of action to impede the lawful
exercise of the city's rights or police powers, including, but not limited
to, requiring the registered communications services provider to remove such
facilities from the public rights-of-way.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.08  WIRELESS FACILITIES.



   (A)   Generally.  The placement of telecommunication towers and
antennae anywhere in the corporate limits of the city shall in all cases be
subject to the city's zoning and land use regulations, including those set
forth in §§ 35.110 through 35.114, Palm Bay Code. Where placement of a
wireless antenna in the public rights-of-way has been approved by the city
and to the extent not inconsistent with any city zoning and land use
regulations, a wireless antenna attached to a permitted and legally
maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way, such as a light
pole or utility pole, shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the city in
writing:



      (1)   not extend more than ten feet (10') above the highest
point of the vertical structure;



      (2)   not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or
illuminations unless required by an applicable federal, state, or local rule,
regulation or law;



      (3)   comply with any applicable Federal Communications
Council Emissions Standards;



      (4)   comply with any applicable local building codes in terms
of design, construction and installation; and



      (5)   not contain any commercial advertising thereon.



   (B)   Small wireless facilities in public rights-of way.  The city
hereby adopts the following rules that will apply to the collocation of small
wireless facilities in public rights-of-way for all applications filed on or
after July 1, 2017:



      (1)   General conditions. Applicants seeking permission to
collocate or install small wireless facilities within public rights-of-way
shall comply with the registration, insurance coverage, indemnification,
performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, city
liability, and city warranties provisions contained in this Chapter 101;
provided, however, that the review timeframes and denial criteria of this §
101.08(B) shall control.



      (2)   Filing, review, and processing of applications. The city
shall accept applications for permits and shall process and issue permits for
the collocation of small wireless facilities in public rights-of-way subject
to the following requirements:



         (a)   The applicant shall as a part of its application
provide information necessary to demonstrate the applicant's compliance with
the applicable provisions of Chapter 101 for the placement of small wireless
facilities in the locations identified in the application, and shall bear the
burden of demonstrating compliance therewith.



         (b)   Within fourteen (14) days after the date of filing
the application, the city may request that the proposed location of a small
wireless facility be moved to another location in the right-of-way and placed
on an alternative city utility pole or support structure or may place a new
utility pole. The city and the applicant may negotiate the alternative
location, including any objective design standards and reasonable spacing
requirements for ground-based equipment, for thirty (30) days after the date
of the request. At the conclusion of the negotiation period, if the
alternative location is accepted by the applicant, the applicant must notify
the city of such acceptance and the application shall be deemed granted for
any new location for which there is agreement and all other locations in the
application. If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the
city of such nonagreement and the city must grant or deny the original
application within ninety (90) days after the date the application was filed.
A request for an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative
location, or a rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and
provided by electronic mail.



         (c)   The city hereby limits the height of a small
wireless facility to 10 feet above the utility pole or structure upon which
the small wireless facility is to be collocated. Unless waived by the city,
the height for a new utility pole is limited to the tallest existing utility
pole as of July 1, 2017, located in the same public right-of-way, other than
a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from
grade in place within five hundred feet (500') of the proposed location of
the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred
feet (500'), the city shall limit the height of the utility pole to fifty
feet (50').



         (d)   Within fourteen (14) days after receiving an
application, the city must determine and notify the applicant by electronic
mail as to whether the application is complete. If an application is deemed
incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An
application is deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to
the applicant within fourteen (14) days.



         (e)   The city shall process all applications on a
nondiscriminatory basis. If the city fails to approve or deny a complete
application within 60 days after receipt of the application, the application
is deemed approved. If the city does not use the 30-day negotiation period
provided herein, the parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day
application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at
the end of the extended period.



         (f)   A permit issued pursuant to an approved
application shall remain effective for 1 year unless extended by the city.



         (g)   The city shall notify the applicant of approval or
denial by electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application
unless it does not meet the applicable provisions of this chapter.



         (h)   If the application is denied, the city shall
specify in writing the basis for denial, including the specific code
provisions on which the denial is based, and shall send the documentation to
the applicant by electronic mail on the day the city denies the application.



         (i)   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified
by the city and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days after notice
of the denial is sent to the applicant.  Failure by the applicant to timely
resubmit the application shall result in a final denial of the application.
The city shall approve or deny a timely filed revised application within
thirty (30) days after receipt or the application is deemed approved. Any
subsequent review shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial.



         (j)   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless
facilities within the city's boundaries may, at the applicant's discretion,
file a consolidated application with the city and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 30 small wireless facilities. If the application
includes multiple small wireless facilities, the city may separately address
small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has
been received or which are denied.



         (k)   The city may deny a proposed collocation of a
small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed
collocation:



            1.    Materially interferes with the safe
operation of traffic control equipment.



            2.    Materially interferes with sight lines or
clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes.



            3.    Materially interferes with compliance with
the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards
regarding pedestrian access or movement.



            4.    Materially fails to comply with the 2010
edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation
Manual.



            5.   Fails to comply with applicable codes and the
applicable provisions of this chapter.



         (l)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the city may reserve space on city utility poles for future
public safety uses. If replacement of a city utility pole is necessary to
accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future
public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to the make-ready
provisions of this ordinance and the replaced pole shall accommodate the
future public safety use.



         (m)   A structure granted a permit and installed
pursuant to this § 101.08(B) shall comply with Fla. Stat. Ch. 333 and
federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections.



         (n)   The city does not require approval or fees for (i)
routine maintenance, (ii) replacement of existing wireless facilities with
substantially similar wireless facilities, or (iii) installation, placement,
maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended
on cables strung between existing utility poles in compliances with
applicable codes by or for a communications services provider authorized to
occupy the public rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under Fla. Stat.
Ch. 202.



      (3)   Collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility
poles.  Collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles is
subject to the following requirements:



         (a)   The city shall not enter into an exclusive
arrangement with any person for the right to attach equipment to city utility
poles.



         (b)   The rates and fees for collocations on city
utility poles must be nondiscriminatory, regardless of the services provided
by the collocating person.



         (c)   The city hereby levies, establishes, and sets an
annual rate that shall be paid by all those applicants who file an
application to collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles in
the amount of $150 per pole per year.  The initial payment shall be made as
a condition of the granting of the permit, with remaining annual payments to
be made in all subsequent years on the same date.



         (d)   Agreements between the city and wireless providers
that are in effect on July 1, 2017, and that relate to the collocation of
small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of
small wireless facilities on city utility poles, remain in effect, subject to
applicable termination provisions. The wireless provider may accept the
rates, fees, and terms established under this subsection for small wireless
facilities and utility poles that are the subject of an application submitted
after the rates, fees, and terms become effective.



         (e)   For a city utility pole that supports an aerial
facility used to provide communications services or electric service by
another, the parties shall comply with the process for make-ready work under
47 U.S.C. s. 224 and implementing regulations.  The good faith estimate of
the person owning or controlling the pole for any make-ready work necessary
to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole
replacement if necessary.



         (f)   For a city utility pole that does not support an
aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service
by another, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready
work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation,
including necessary pole replacement, within sixty (60) days after receipt of
a complete application. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must
be completed within sixty (60) days after written acceptance of the good
faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the city may require the
applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a
make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to
support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform
the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the
make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation
of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The
city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains,
develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to
usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The
replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city.



         (g)   The city may not require more make-ready work than
is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for
make-ready work may not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior
noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may
not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications services
providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and may not
include any consultant fee or expense.



      (4)   Placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way
in support of collocation of small wireless facilities.  A wireless
infrastructure provider may apply to the city to place utility poles in the
public rights-of-way to support the collocation of small wireless facilities.
The application must include an attestation that small wireless facilities
will be collocated on the utility pole or structure and will be used by a
wireless services provider to provide service within nine (9) months after
the date the application is approved by the city. The city shall accept and
process the application in accordance with § 101.08(B) and any applicable
codes and other local codes governing the placement of utility poles in the
public rights-of-way.



      (5)   Application and enforcement of historic preservation
zoning regulations.  Consistent with preservation of local zoning authority
under 47 U.S.C. s. 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications
under 47 U.S.C. s. 1455(a), and the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, this § 101.08(B) is subject to the provisions of Chapter
38, City Code, Historic Preservation.



      (6)   Prohibited collocations, attachments, installations, and
services not authorized by § 101.08(B). This § 101.08(B) does not
authorize, and the city hereby prohibits, the following:



         (a)   This § 101.08(B) does not authorize a person to
collocate or attach wireless facilities, including any antenna, micro
wireless facility, or small wireless facility, on a privately-owned utility
pole, a utility pole owned by an electric cooperative or a municipal electric
utility, a privately owned wireless support structure, or other private
property without the consent of the property owner.



         (b)   The approval of the installation, placement,
maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility pursuant to this §
101.08(B) does not authorize the provision of any voice, data, or video
services or the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any
communications facilities other than small wireless facilities in the public
right-of-way. 



         (c)   This § 101.08(B) does not affect provisions
relating to pass-through providers contained in this ordinance and contained
in Fla. Stat. § 337.401(6).



         (d)   This § 101.08(B) does not apply to the
installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless
facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications
facilities, provided that once aerial facilities are converted to underground
facilities, any such collocation or construction shall be only as provided by
the city's underground utilities ordinance. 



         (e)   This § 101.08(B) does not authorize a person to
collocate small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a city
utility pole or erect a wireless support structure in a location subject to
covenants, conditions, restrictions, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of
a homeowners' association. This paragraph does not apply to the installation,
placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any
existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities.

§ 101.09  REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF DEVELOPMENT  PERMITS.



   Subject to § 101.11, the city may revoke any development permit
currently issued to a communications services provider for work in the public
rights-of-way or suspend the issuance of development permits in the future to
a communications services provider for, in addition to any other
circumstances provided for in this chapter, one or more of the following
reasons:



   (A)   a violation of permit conditions, including conditions set
forth in the permit, this Chapter 101, and other applicable codes or
regulations governing the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities in the public rights-of-way;



   (B)   a misrepresentation or fraud made or committed on the part of
the communications services provider in the registration process or in the
application for a development permit;



   (C)   the failure to properly renew the registration or the
ineffectiveness of registration; or



   (D)   the failure to relocate or remove communications facilities as
may be required by the city pursuant to this Chapter 101.



   The public works director or his designee shall provide notice and an
opportunity to cure any violation of (A) through (D) above, each of which
shall be reasonable under the circumstances.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.10  INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION.



   (A)   The city may terminate a registration if:



      (1)   a Federal or State authority suspends, denies, or
revokes a communications services provider's certification or license to
provide communications services;



      (2)   the communications services provider's placement or
maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents
an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public
rights-of-way and the communications services provider fails to remedy the
danger promptly after receipt of written notice;



      (3)   the communications services provider ceases to use all
of its communications facilities in the public rights-of-way and has not
complied with § 101.21 herein; or



      (4)   the communications services provider fails to comply
with any of the rules, regulations or general conditions set forth in §
101.06 herein.



   (B)   Prior to termination of a registration, the communications
services provider shall be notified by the public works director or his
designee with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the
proposed termination, including which of (1) through (4) above is applicable
as the reason therefor. The communications services provider shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice within which to eliminate the
reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the public works
director or his designee, to accomplish the same. If not eliminated or if the
plan presented is rejected, the public works director or his designee shall
provide written notice of such rejection to the communications services
provider and a final determination to terminate registration. A final
determination to terminate registration may be appealed in accordance with
the procedures set forth in § 101.11.



   (C)   In the event of termination, following any appeal period, the
communications services provider formerly registered shall: (1) notify the
city of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of
ownership of the communications services provider's facilities in public
rights-of-way or (2) provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition
of its communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. If a
communications services provider fails to comply with this subsection (C),
which determination of non-compliance is subject to appeal as provided in §
101.11, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities
where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the
facilities or requiring the communications services provider within 90 days
of the termination, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed to
between the city and the communications services provider, to remove some or
all of the communications facilities from the public rights-of-way and
restore the public rights-of-way to their original condition prior to such
removal.



   (D)   In any event, a communications services provider whose
registration has been terminated shall take such steps as are necessary to
render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the
public rights-of-way.



   (E)   In the event of termination of a registration, this section
does not authorize the city to cause the removal of communications facilities
used to provide another service for which the communications services
provider or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the
communications facilities holds a valid certification or license with the
governing Federal or State agency, if required for provision of such service,
and who is registered with the city, if required.



   (F)   The city's right to terminate a registration shall be in
addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this chapter,
or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of the
right to terminate registration will affect or preclude any other right the
city may have.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.11  APPEALS.



   Final determinations by appropriate city staff denying an initial
registration; denying an application for renewal of a registration;
terminating a registration; or denying, revoking or suspending any
development permit are subject to appeal. A notice of appeal of such decision
may be filed with the city's Manager within thirty (30) days of the date of
the final, written decision to be appealed. The City Manager shall have
thirty (30) days from the date the appeal is filed to review the matter and
render a written decision to uphold or reverse the final decision made by
staff. If the City Manager upholds the final decision of staff, the appellant
may file a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of
the date of the written decision of the Chief Administrative Officer. The
City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the City Council at any
regular meeting of City Council scheduled within forty-five (45) days of the
date that the notice of appeal is filed with the City Clerk, unless waived by
the communications services provider. A ruling may be made at the hearing or
at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting and the communications
services provider shall be notified of the decision in writing within thirty
(30) days thereof. Where a notice of appeal to the City Manager or the City
Clerk is not timely filed as provided herein, such right to appeal shall be
waived. Upon correction by the communications services provider of the
circumstances that gave rise to a suspension or denial of a development
permit, the suspension or denial shall be lifted (the same does not apply to
the revocation of a development permit).



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.12  FEES APPLICABLE TO THOSE NOT SUBJECT TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
TAX.



   While the Florida Legislature has prohibited municipalities from
requiring providers of communications services who have registered with the
Florida Department of Revenue from having to enter into franchise agreements
or license arrangements as a condition to placing or maintaining
communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, the city expressly
reserves the right to require the payment of consideration or regulatory fees
by persons using or occupying the public rights-of-way in other capacities.
The city reserves the right to require such payments based on the type of
user and to the extent as follows:



   (A)   Dealer. Except as provided in paragraph (16) of § 101.06(B),
a communications services provider who meets the definition of dealer as set
forth in this Chapter 101 and who has registered in accordance with § 101.04
is not required to enter into a franchise agreement or license arrangement
with the city as a condition to placing or maintaining communications
facilities in the public rights-of-way, nor is a dealer required to make
payment of any franchise fees, license fees or other user fees to the city as
consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the
provision of communication services.



   (B)   Pass-through provider and pass through facilities. A
communications services provider who meets the definition of pass-through
provider as set forth in this Chapter 101 and who is not subject to the City
of Palm Bay's Local Communications Services Tax imposed pursuant to Fla.
Stat. §§ 202.19 and 202.20 shall pay the city the maximum annual amount
allowed under Fla. Stat. § 337.401, as amended. For purposes of calculating
payments hereunder, each separate pole or tower installed or maintained by a
pass-through provider for purposes of supporting antennas for other
over-the-air radio transmission or reception equipment in the public
rights-of-way shall comprise a separate communications facility subject to
assessment of a separate permit fee in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) per linear mile, or portion thereof, up to the maximum amount
allowed under Fla. Stat. § 337.401, whichever is higher. The annual amount
referred to above shall be due and payable on October 1 of every year
beginning on October 1, 2017. Fees not paid within ten (10) days after the
due date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the
date due until paid. The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the
city shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the
correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a
release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and
payable or authorization to install any facilities in the public
rights-of-way.



   (C)   Other persons. All other persons, except government, are
required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the
public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities, an amount based on and in accordance with the fee provision in §
101.12(B), Palm Bay Code.



   (D)   Government. A government is not required to pay the city
consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the
placement or maintenance of communications facilities, unless such facilities
are being used by such government or a communications services provider,
including resellers, to offer or provide communication services other than
for such government's internal non-commercial use, in which event the
government, where not subject to the City of Palm Bay's Local Communications
Services Tax imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, is
required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the
public rights-of-way by or through its facilities placed therein after
October 1, 2017, an amount based on and in accordance with the fee provision
in § 101.12(B), Palm Bay Code, or such other amount or rate of compensation
as mutually agreed to in writing by the government and the city.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.13  EXISTING COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.



   A communications services provider with a facility in the public
rights-of-way as of the effective date of this Chapter 101 has until October
1, 2017 to comply with the provisions of this chapter, including, but not
limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.14  INSURANCE.



   (A)   At all times during the use or occupancy of the public
rights-of-way, including any time during placement or maintenance of
communications facilities, the communications services provider shall obtain,
pay all premiums for, and maintain satisfactory to the city the types of
insurance policies and coverage limits described in this § 101.14. Nothing
contained in this chapter shall limit a communications services provider's
liability to the city to the limits of insurance certified or carried.



      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance valid in the
State of Florida, including contractual liability and products completed
operations liability coverage on an occurrence basis, which policy limit
shall be in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per
occurrence, combined single limit, for bodily injury, personal injury or
death, or property damage and in an amount not less than two million dollars
($2,000,000) policy aggregate for each personal injury liability, broad form
property damage (without XCU exclusions), contractual liability and
products-completed operations liability.



      (2)   Business automobile liability insurance valid in the
State of Florida which policy limit shall be in an amount not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit, including bodily injury
and property damage covering owned, leased, hired and non-owner vehicles.



      (3)   Workers' Compensation valid in the State of Florida
which policy limit shall be in an amount not less than the statutory limit
for Workers' Compensation.



      (4)   Employer's liability insurance valid in the State of
Florida which policy limit shall be in an amount not less than one million
dollars ($1,000,000) each accident for employer's liability.



   (B)   All insurance providers used shall be admitted and duly
authorized to do business in the State of Florida and shall have assigned by
A. M. Best Company a minimum Financial Strength Rating of "A" and a minimum
Financial Size Category of "IX" (i.e., a size of $250,000,000 to $500,000,000
based on capital, surplus, and conditional reserve funds). Insurance policies
and certificates issued by non-admitted insurance companies are not
acceptable. All liability policies shall name the city, its council members,
officers, and employees as additional insureds with respect to any covered
liability arising out of the placement or maintenance of communications
facilities in the public rights-of-way or other activities under this
chapter. Each communications services provider shall furnish annually to the
city certificates showing proof of all required insurance coverage. All
liability coverage must be in occurrence form and in accordance with the
limits specified. Claims made policies are not acceptable. No insurance
policy shall be canceled, nor shall the occurrence or aggregate limits set
forth herein be reduced, until the city has received at least thirty (30)
days' advance written notice by registered, certified or regular mail or
facsimile of any cancellation, intent not to renew or reduction in policy
coverage. Each communications services provider shall be responsible for
notifying the city of such cancellation, intent not to renew or reduction in
coverage. All Certificate(s) of Insurance, including all endorsements and
riders, evidencing insurance coverage shall be submitted to the city within
thirty (30) days after the date of registration with the city in order for a
communications services provider to obtain development permits required for
construction in the public rights-of-way. Each communications services
provider shall, in the event of any such notice described above, obtain, pay
all premiums for, and file with the city, written evidence of the issuance of
replacement policies within thirty (30) days following receipt by the city or
the communications services provider of such notice.



   (C)   The Certificate(s) of Insurance forms must be properly
executed by the authorized representative of the insurance provider and must
include all endorsements, riders and notices. Each communications services
provider shall file and maintain with the city on an annual basis the
required Certificate(s) of Insurance. The Certificate(s) of Insurance must
indicate the following:



      (1)   the policy number; name of insurance company; name and
address of the agent or authorized representative; name and address of
insured; that the policy coverage "pertains the requirements of § 101.14 of
the Palm Bay Communications Right-of- Way Utilization Ordinance;" policy
expiration date; and specific coverage amounts; and



      (2)   any applicable deductibles or self-insured retentions;
and



      (3)   that the city, its council members, officers and
employees are additional insureds; and



      (4)   that the city shall receive thirty (30) days' advance
written notice of cancellation, intent not to renew or reduction in coverage;
and



      (5)   that the commercial general liability insurance policy
is primary as respects any other valid or collectible insurance that the city
may possess, including any self-insured retentions the city may have; and any
other insurance the city does possess shall be considered excess insurance
only and shall not be required to contribute with this insurance.



   (D)   Under extraordinary circumstances a communications services
provider may satisfy the insurance requirements of this chapter by providing
documentation of self-insurance that, in the sole discretion of the Director
of Human Resources and Risk Management, demonstrates incontrovertibly the
adequacy to defend and cover claims of any nature that might arise from the
placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way. The
communications services provider must be authorized as a self-insurer by the
Department of Insurance under the laws of the State of Florida.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.15  INDEMNIFICATION.



   (A)   Except with respect to the willful misconduct, negligence or
gross negligence of the city, a communications services provider, by act of
registering with the city as such, shall be obligated, at its sole cost and
expense, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officials,
Council members, agents and employees from and against any and all claims,
suits, causes of action, proceedings, liabilities and judgments for damages
or equitable relief, and costs and expenses arising out of or in connection
with the placement or maintenance of its communications facilities in the
public rights-of-way by the communications services provider or its agent or
hired contractor. This indemnification provision shall include, but not be
limited to, such damages and penalties arising out of claims (1) by any
person whatsoever on account of (i) bodily injury to a person or persons,
(ii) death of a person or persons or (iii) property damage, where any of the
foregoing is occasioned by the operations of the communications services
provider, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred or (2) involving the
communications services provider's violation of any easement or private
property rights.



   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from
participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel if in the
city's reasonable belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential
conflict or appearance of a conflict.



   (C)   Indemnified costs and expenses shall include, but not be
limited to, all out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees in
defending against any such claim, suit or proceeding, and shall also include
the reasonable value of any services rendered by the City Attorney or his
assistants or any consultants, agents and employees of the city. The city
will attempt to notify the communications services provider, in writing,
within a reasonable time of the city's receiving notice of any issue it
determines may require indemnification.



   (D)   Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed or
interpreted: (1) as denying the city, the communications services provider or
any person any remedy or defense available to them under the laws of the
State of Florida; or (2) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver
provided in Fla. Stat. § 768.28, as it may be amended.



   (E)   The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in
effect after the termination or cancellation of a registration.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.16  CONSTRUCTION BOND.



   (A)   Prior to issuance of any development permit where the type of
work allowed under the permit will require restoration of the public
rights-of-way, the communications services provider or the contractor
performing such work on its behalf shall obtain, pay for and file with the
city a construction bond. The construction bond shall serve to guarantee the
timeliness and quality of the construction and restoration work and to
secure, and enable the city to recover, all costs related to the restoration
of the public rights-of-way in the event the communications services provider
or its contractor fails to make such restoration to the city's satisfaction
or causes damage to the public rights-of-way during construction. The
construction bond must name the city as obligee and be in the face amount of
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) conditioned upon the full and faithful
completion of construction and restoration of the public rights-of-way to its
original condition. Six (6) months following completion and inspection of the
restoration of the public rights-of-way satisfactory to the public works
director or his designee, the communications services provider or its
contractor, as the case may be, may reduce the face amount of the
construction bond to five thousand dollars ($5,000) and, thereafter, may
allow the bond to lapse in accordance with its terms. However, for any
subsequent work in the public rights-of-way, the communications services
provider or its contractor will be required to replenish any existing
construction bond or provide a new construction bond in the face amount of
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The construction bond shall be in a form
acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a surety having a
rating reasonably acceptable to the public works director or his designee and
authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue surety bonds in
this State.



   (B)   The construction bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be
for a term of not less than twelve (12) months. In the event the term of any
construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the
completion of construction, restoration and city inspection, the
communications services provider, or the contractor acting on its behalf,
shall immediately obtain, pay for, and file with the city a replacement bond.



   (C)   The city's requirement of a construction bond is not in lieu
of any additional bonds that may be required under this chapter or through
the permitting process. The city's right to recover under the construction
bond shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved
in this chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect or
preclude any other right the city may have.



(Ord. 2017-66, passed 10-3-17)



§ 101.17  PERFORMANCE BOND.



   (A)   Before any communications services provider is permitted to
begin the placement or maintenance of an initial build, any substantial
rebuild, upgrade or extension of its communications system, or when
construction plans show that there would be at least one thousand (1,000)
feet of open trenching in the public rights-of-way at any given time, the
communications services provider is required to obtain, pay for, and file
with the city a performance bond. The performance bond must name the city as
obligee and be in the face amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars
($250,000) conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance by the
communications services provider with all requirements, duties and
obligations imposed by the provisions of the Palm Bay Communications
Right-of-Way Utilization Ordinance during, and through completion of, the
placement or maintenance project. The performance bond shall be in a form
acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a surety having a
rating reasonably acceptable to the public works director or his designee and
authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue performance bonds
in this state.



   (B)   The performance bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be
for a term consistent with the reasonably expected duration of the particular
placement or maintenance project (including restoration and city inspection),
but in no event less than eighteen (18) months. In the event the term of any
performance bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the
completion of such placement or maintenance project, including restoration
and city inspection, the communications services provider shall immediately
obtain, pay for, and file with the city a replacement bond.



   (C)   The city's requirement of a performance bond is not in lieu of
any additional bonds that may be required under this chapter or through the
permitting process. The city's right to recover under the performance bond
shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in
this chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of a right with respect to the performance bond will affect or
preclude any other right the city may have. Any proceeds recovered under the
performance bond may be used to reimburse the city for such additional

   Every communications services provider shall make a twenty-five
thousand dollar ($25,000) cash deposit, or shall file with the city an
irrevocable letter of credit or acceptable equivalent in the same amount,
which shall serve, and be referred to, as the "Security Fund." The Security
Fund shall be conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance with and
performance by the communications services provider of all requirements,
duties and obligations imposed by the provisions of the Palm Bay
Communications Right-of-Way Utilization Ordinance at all times. The letter of
credit shall be in a form and issued by an institution acceptable to the
city's Chief Financial Officer. Should the city draw upon the Security Fund,
it shall promptly notify the communications services provider, and the
communications services provider shall promptly restore the cash deposit or
letter of credit to the full amount. The Security Fund shall be maintained
until the later of (a) the effective date of transfer, sale or assignment by
the communications services provider of all its facilities in the public
rights-of-way, (b) twelve (12) months after the removal or abandonment by the
communications services provider of all of its facilities in the public
rights-of-way or (c) six (6) months after the termination of registration,
including any appeals undertaken pursuant to § 101.11 herein. Upon the later
of these events the cash deposit will be returned without interest or the
letter of credit may be cancelled. In the event a communications services
provider fails to perform any requirement, duty or obligation imposed upon it
by the provisions of this chapter, there shall be recoverable, jointly and
severally from the Security Fund, any damages or loss suffered by the city as
a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or
cost of removal, relocation or abandonment of any facilities in public
rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the
full amount of the Security Fund.

§ 101.19  ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.



   (A)   No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar the right
of the city to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any
provisions of this chapter, the registration provisions, or any rule,
regulation or general condition provided for hereunder, whether
administratively, judicially or both. Neither the existence of other remedies
identified in this chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or
otherwise limit the right of the city to recover fines, penalties or monetary
damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such
violation by the communications services provider. The remedies available to
the city shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided
by law or equity. The laws of the State of Florida shall govern with respect
to any proceeding in law or equity pertaining to the enforcement of this
chapter or any cause of action arising out of or in connection herewith.



   (B)   A communications services provider's failure to comply with
provisions of this chapter shall constitute a City Code violation and shall
subject the communications service provider to the code enforcement
provisions and procedures as provided in Chapter 52, §§ 52.080-52.092, Palm
Bay Code, and may be punishable as provided in Fla. Stat. § 162.22, as it
may be amended.



   (C)   In any proceeding before the City Council where there exists
an issue with respect to a communications services provider's performance of
its obligations pursuant to this chapter, the communications services
provider shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may
have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this
ordinance. The city may find a communications services provider that does not
demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter in
default and apply any appropriate remedy or remedies as authorized by this
ordinance. In determining which remedy is appropriate, the City Council shall
take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person bearing the
impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to
prevent further violations, and such other matters as the City Council
determines are appropriate to the public interest.



   (D)   The public works director or his designee shall be responsible
for administration and enforcement of this chapter, and is authorized to give
any notice required herein or by law.



   (E)   Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this
chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that
violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate
enforcement remedies.

services provider in the public rights-of-way, the communications services
provider shall notify the city within sixty (60) days.



   (B)   The city may direct the communications services provider, by
written notice, to remove all or any portion of such abandoned communications
facility at the communications services provider's sole expense if the city
determines that the abandoned communications facility's presence interferes
with the public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not
be limited to, a determination that such communications facility: (1)
compromises safety at any time for any public rights-of-way user; (2)
compromises the safety of other persons performing placement or maintenance
of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way; (3) prevents
another person from locating other facilities in the area of the public
rights-of-way where the abandoned communications facility is located when
other alternative locations are not reasonably available; or (4) creates a
maintenance condition that is disruptive to the use of the public
rights-of-way. In the event of (2), the city may require the third person to
coordinate with the communications services provider that owns the existing
communications facility for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by
the communications services provider.



   (C)   If the communications services provider fails to remove all or
any portion of an abandoned communications facility as directed by the city
within the time period specified in the written notice, which time period
must be reasonable under the circumstances, the city may perform such removal
and charge the cost of the removal against the communications services
provider.



   (D)   In the event that the city does not direct the removal of the
abandoned communications facility, the communications services provider, by
its notice of abandonment to the city, shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of such abandoned facility by the
city or other person, provided that the cost of the alteration or removal is
not borne by the communications services provider.

exercise of its municipal authority.

such additional reasonable regulations as City Council finds necessary in the

   (D)   To exercise the power of eminent domain, consistent with
applicable federal and state law, to acquire property that may include that
property owned or leased by a communications services provider.



   (E)   As and when deemed necessary by City Council to be in the
interest of the city or its residents, to abandon portions of the public
rights-of-way within the proper exercise of its municipal authority and
without notice to or the consent of any communications services provider. The
city shall not be responsible for any costs, damages, loss or other expense
to the communications services provider as a result of the city's abandonment
of any public rights- of-way.



   (F)   To place and maintain, and franchise or permit to be placed or
maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and
other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be
done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be
deemed necessary or proper by the city in the public rights-of-way occupied
by any communications services provider.



   (G)   Without limitation, the right to alter, change, or cause to be
changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of any public
rights-of-way within the city limits and within said limits as the same may
from time to time be altered.



   (H)   To require a reseller to register in accordance with § 101.04
to the extent such reseller wants the right to place or maintain facilities
in the public rights-of-way. Any person using or leasing facilities owned by
a registered communications services provider is not, therefore, entitled to
any rights to place or maintain communications facilities in the public
rights-of-way, unless such person themselves registers with the city.

accepted accounting practices. In addition, consecutively numbered duplicate
receipts must be prepared for each sale, with the patron receiving one
receipt and the permittee keeping the duplicate receipt. Receipts may be
produced either by cash registers that automatically record duplicate
receipts or by some other method approved in advance by the city. All money
received from sales shall be deposited, within 24 hours of receipt from
patrons, in a separate bank account, used only by the charity for bingo
funds. No credit or extended payment terms shall be extended to any patron at
any time. All authorized expenditures and bingo prizes shall be paid by
pre-printed, consecutively numbered checks written on the charity's bingo
bank account. All checks written on the account must show the legal name of
the payee and the payee's social security number or federal tax I.D. number.
For each session, a written record  must  be  kept  setting  forth  the
name of the charity, the date, starting and ending times, the number of
patrons present, the total amount of money received, the prizes awarded, the
check numbers of the checks used to pay the bingo prizes, and the names of
the designated members of the charity conducting the game.



   (B)   In addition, a continuous VHS recording (with both audio and
video being recorded) of each session shall be made starting five minutes
before the beginning of the session and ending no earlier than five minutes
after the end of the session. At the beginning of the VHS tape, a placard
must be displayed before the video camera showing the date and time, and an
audio statement must be recorded stating the date, name of the charity, the
name of the designated members conducting the session, and the number of
patrons present. The remainder of the VHS video portion of the tape shall
show the numbers being drawn during the session. The audio portion of the VHS
recording shall record the voices of the designated members conducting the

session, a designated member of the charity must make an audio statement once
again setting forth the date, name of the charity, names of the designated
members who conducted the session, the number of patrons present, plus the
number and amount of prizes awarded, and the numbers of the checks used to

portion of the VHS recording their names and a statement that the information
stated regarding their session is accurate. In addition, those two designated
members must sign-off before close of the session as to the accuracy of the
receipts, expenditures and all other bookkeeping records relating to that
session. Sign-off forms shall be as prescribed by the city.



   (C)   All bookkeeping records, including, but not limited to, all
the written records, sign-off forms, bank statements, cancelled checks, check
books, duplicate receipts, deposit tickets and receipts, and all leases and
agreements shall be maintained on the premises of the bingo hall for a period
of no less than three years. All VHS tapes of the sessions must be labeled
with the date of the session, the beginning and ending  times  of  the 
taping,  and  the  name  of  the charity conducting the  bingo, and 
they  must  be maintained on the premises of the bingo hall for a period of
no less than one year after the session recorded on the VHS tape. All
bookkeeping records and VHS tapes of sessions shall be available for
inspection and copying by the city and by state and county law enforcement
personnel at all times that the bingo hall is open for business.



   (D)   Charities permitted to conduct bingo in a bingo hall which
have gross bingo receipts of more than $52,000 annually, or gross bingo
receipts of more than $1,000 in any one week, may spend a maximum of 25% of
the gross receipts, less prizes which are attributable to sessions, for
payment of authorized expenses. In no event shall the charity expend bingo
proceeds for any purpose other than prizes attributable to such sessions and
authorized expenses as defined herein. All other bingo proceeds must be
utilized for charitable purposes by the charity. Charities permitted to
conduct bingo in a bingo hall with annual gross receipts of $52,000 or less
per year and which do not have gross receipts of over $1,000 in any one week,
may deduct the actual cost of authorized expenses and the amount of prizes
attributable to sessions, with the remainder of the bingo proceeds being
utilized for charitable purposes by the charity.



(Ord. 96-09, passed 2-15-96)



§ 110.59  FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS; BOOKKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   For-profit bingo organizations must keep complete financial
records in accordance with generally-accepted accounting practices. Funds of
for-profit bingo organizations must be kept in a separate and distinct bank
account with the words “For-Profit Bingo Account - Palm Bay” in its name.
No interested party in for-profit bingo organizations, or any spouse, parent,
relative to the third degree, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, father-in-law,
mother-in-law, sibling or child of an interested party in for-profit bingo
organizations may be a designated member of any charity conducting bingo in a
bingo hall. All money received from any source by for-profit bingo
organizations must be deposited into the bank account within 24 hours of
receipt. All authorized  expenditures  made  by for-profit bingo
organizations shall be paid by pre-printed, consecutively numbered checks
written on the bank account of the for-profit bingo organization. All checks
written on the account must show the legal name of the payee and the payee's
social security or federal tax I.D. number. All bookkeeping records,
including, but not limited to, bank statements, cancelled checks, check
books, deposit tickets and receipts, and all leases and agreements shall be
maintained by the for-profit bingo organizations on the premises of the bingo
hall for a period of no less than three years.



   (B)   Because it is the intent of the state law regulating bingo
that all profits from bingo operations are to go to charity, for-profit bingo
organizations must not charge for the rental or sale of property or equipment
or supplies any more than is ordinary and customary in the county area for
the sale or rental of property, equipment or supplies under similar
circumstances. Rental terms for equipment must be compared to long-term
rentals rather than short-term or transitory rentals, and because rental of
property and equipment is utilized by more than one charity in the bingo
hall, the cost for rental of property and equipment must be equitably divided
among the various charities operating within such bingo hall.



   (C)   All bookkeeping records of for-profit bingo organizations
shall be available for inspection, auditing and copying by the city and by
state and county law enforcement personnel at all times that the bingo hall
is open for business upon verbal request, or at any other time mutually
agreed upon. In the event an audit by a Florida Certified Public Accountant
(CPA), designated by the city, reveals charges to the charities in excess of
those which are ordinary and customary in the county area, as determined by
such CPA, the for-profit bingo organization shall equitably refund the
difference to the charities operating in the bingo hall. In the event a
for-profit bingo organization wishes to appeal the determination of the CPA,
it may file a notice of appeal with the City Clerk along with a certified
audit by a CPA upon which the for-profit bingo organization is basing its
appeal. A hearing before the City Council shall be held within 30 days of
receipt by the City Clerk of the notice of appeal and the certified audit.
The city shall hire a third CPA to review the audits previously performed and
any other records deemed appropriate by such CPA, and the city shall base the
results of the appeal on all the reports of the CPA presented to the city. If
a not-profit bingo operation wishes to appeal any determination made by the
City Council under this section, it may appeal such determination to the
court of appropriate jurisdiction in the county.

§ 110.68  APPEAL FROM ACTION OF CITY.



   (A)   If the city determines that it may not issue a permit to the
applicant under the provisions of this chapter, without specific
authorization from the City Council or under the provisions of § 110.61
relating to incomplete applications or applications not accompanied by the
required fee, the city shall notify the applicant by hand delivery or by
certified mail of the city's intention to deny the permit within 15 days
after making such determination. Such notice shall include a copy of this
subchapter and the reason(s) for the denial of the permit. The applicant
shall have the right to appeal the city's determination to deny the permit to
the City Council by filing with the City Clerk a notice of appeal within ten
days of receipt by applicant of notice of intent to deny. If an applicant
appeals a determination by the city to deny a permit based upon failure to
submit a properly completed application or for failure to submit the required
fee, the City Council, within 15 days of such appeal, shall hold a hearing to
determine whether such application is sufficiently complete to comply with
the requirements of § 110.61 and/or the required fee was submitted with such
application. If the City Council determines that such application is
sufficiently complete to comply with the requirements of § 110.61, and the
required fee was submitted therewith, City Council shall direct the city to
process such application. If the City Council determines that the application
is not sufficiently complete to comply with the requirements of § 110.61, or
that the required fee was not submitted therewith, the City Council shall
direct the city to issue a notice of final denial of the application for
permit. Provided however, if the City Council finds that the defects in the
application or the failure to pay the required fee were the result of
excusable neglect or inadvertence on the part of the applicant, the City
Council may grant the applicant a specific time period, not to exceed 20
days, within which to submit a properly completed application and/or submit
the required fee.



   (B)   If an applicant appeals a determination by the city to deny a
permit or renewal of a permit based upon any grounds other than an incomplete
application or failure to submit the required fee, the City Council, within
15 days of such appeal, shall hold a hearing to determine whether issuance or
renewal of the permit would be detrimental to the public health, safety or
welfare. In determining whether issuance or renewal of the permit would be
detrimental to public health, safety or welfare, the City Council shall
consider whether the factor(s) which caused the city to not issue a permit

§ 119.10  STANDARDS OF PERMIT ISSUANCE.



   (A)   The standards or criteria used by the City Manager during the
permit review process vary depending on the type of event. Under no
circumstances will the City Manager use the content or message of the event
when deciding whether to grant or deny a permit for a special event on
city-owned property, a special event on non-city owned property, parade,
block party, or demonstration. The City Manager shall treat all applicants
uniformly in a just, fair, and nondiscriminatory manner, bearing in mind that
the time, place, duration, and manner of the proposed uses shall be
subordinate to the public health, safety, and welfare. The criteria provided
below for each type of event shall be used by the City Manager in determining
whether the proposed activity is best suited for the time, place, and manner.



      (1)   Special events on city-owned property.



For special events on city-owned property, the City Manager will take the
following into consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:



         (a)   The demands that the event will place on city
services and the expenses associated with traffic, parking, and clean up.



         (b)   The availability of city facilities at the time of
the proposed event.



         (c)   The existence or interference with another event
with an already existing valid permit.



         (d)   The compatibility with the surrounding area.



      (2)   Parades.  For parades, the City Manager will take the
following into consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:



         (a)   Whether the parade will substantially interrupt
the safe and orderly movement of other traffic near its route.



         (b)   Whether the parade will place such a burden on the
Police, Fire, and Public Works Departments that they would be unable to
provide normal services for the remainder of the city.



         (c)   Whether the parade route will prevent the Police
and Fire Departments from providing emergency services to surrounding
properties.



         (d)   Whether the collection of parade participants,
animals, and vehicles in the assembly and disbanding areas will interfere
with the Police and Fire Departments from providing emergency services to the
surrounding properties.



         (e)   Whether the event will conflict with a previously
scheduled event that is scheduled to either occur at the same time and place;
or occur at the same time and at a location that will be interfered with if a
second permit is issued.



      (3)   Block parties.  For block parties, the City Manager
will take the following into consideration when determining whether to issue
a permit:



         (a)   The event is closed to the public.



         (b)   No commercial activity of any kind is to be
conducted on the public street, sidewalk, or other right-of-way while the

         (f)   The street is not an arterial road, or a collector
road as defined by Fla. Stat. § 334.03.



      (4)   Demonstrations. To preserve the citizens' right to First
Amendment expression, this section sets forth rules governing the permitting
of demonstrations. The permit requirements for a demonstration are designed
to protect the health, safety, and welfare of those participating in
demonstrations or affected by demonstrations while ensuring the prevention of
any censure of messages. For demonstrations, the City Manager will take the
following into consideration when determining whether to issue a permit:



         (a)   The location of the demonstration.



         (b)   Whether the grouping of people at the chosen
location will prevent the ingress and egress to property.



         (c)   Whether the demonstrators will be able to follow
all other applicable laws at the chosen location.



         (d)   Whether grouping of people at the chosen location
will prevent the Police and Fire Departments from responding to emergency
situations in the surrounding area.

events on non-city-owned property, the City Manager will take the following

the ability of the city to accommodate or respond to the event with necessary
resources.



         (b)   The impact of the special event on the traffic,
security, health and safety of the public and the plans of the applicant to
address such impacts that include but are not limited to planned access,
parking area, restroom and/or portable toilets and adequate crowd control.



         (c)   The existence or interference with another event
with an already existing valid permit.

      (6)   If the use or the event would conflict with previously
planned programs organized and conducted by the city or non-governmental
agencies previously scheduled for the same time and place.



      (7)   The applicant does not comply with all applicable city
ordinances, traffic rules, park rules and regulations, state health laws,
fire codes and liquor licensing regulations.



      (8)   The use or event proposed by the applicant would present
an unreasonable danger to health or safety of the public or applicant.



      (9)   If the applicant cannot comply with applicable local,
state and federal license requirements for all or part of the planned event.



      (10)   If the use or event is prohibited by law.

exceeded, by what duration, and at what locations. Such permit authorization
may be modified or revoked if in the discretion of the City Manager the
authorization excessively negatively impacts the surrounding neighborhood.

forbidden.



   (B)   Any person who shall violate the provisions of this section,
upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by the same penalty as is provided
therefor by the laws of the state, but in no case shall such penalty exceed
the penalty prescribed in § 10.99 of this code of ordinances.

Statutory reference:



   Authority for any person charged with the violation of an ordinance,
which is also a violation of state law,  to cause the transfer of the case

not to exceed maximum municipal penalty, was a valid ordinance and not
repealed by the section prohibiting adoption of penalty clause by reference.

it unlawful to commit within the city any act recognized by state law as a
misdemeanor included misdemeanor laws of the state subsequently adopted.

records required by this section to be retained must be stored at a location

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS



§ 150.50  GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS REGARDING RESIDENTIAL SOLID WASTE
SERVICES.



   (A)   Signed Application Required. Solid waste services may be
furnished only after a signed application or agreement and payment of the
applicable deposits are accepted by the city. The conditions of such
application or agreement are binding upon the customer as well as upon the
city. A copy of the application or agreement for solid waste service accepted
by the city will be furnished to the applicant on request. The applicant
shall furnish the correct name and street address or lot and block number at
which solid waste services are to be rendered.  Applications or agreements
and the applicable deposits shall not be required for customers of the
city’s exclusive franchise collector of solid waste as of September 30,
2010, provided that said customer is not more than ninety (90) days
delinquent in payment for those solid waste services.



   (B)   Withholding Service. The city may withhold or discontinue
solid waste services rendered under application made by any member or agent
of a household, organization, or business unless all prior indebtedness to
the city of that member or agent for solid waste service has been settled in
full in accordance with city policy. Service may also be discontinued for any
violation made by the customer of any rule or regulation set forth in this
chapter.



   (C)   Continuity of Service. The city will at all times use
reasonable diligence to provide continuous solid waste services and, having
used reasonable diligence, shall not be liable to the customer for failure or
interruption of continuous solid waste services. The city shall not be liable
for any act or omission caused directly or indirectly by strikes, labor
trouble, accidents, litigation, breakdowns, shutdowns for emergency repairs
or adjustments, acts of sabotage, enemies of the United States, wars, United
States, State, municipal or other governmental interferences, acts of God or
other causes beyond its control.



   (D)   Protection of City’s Property. The customer shall exercise
reasonable diligence to protect the city’s property on the customer’s
premises and shall knowingly permit no one, but the city’s agent or persons
authorized by law, to have access to the city’s refuse containers. In the
event of any loss or damage to property of the city caused by or arising out
of carelessness, neglect, or misuse by the customer, the cost of making good
such loss or repairing such damage shall be paid by the customer.



   (E)   Access To Premises. The duly authorized agents of the city
shall have access at all reasonable hours to the premises of the customer for
the purpose of collecting or servicing the city’s refuse containers, or
removing the city’s refuse containers under or termination of the city’s
agreement with the customer and under such performance shall not be liable
for trespass.



   (F)   Billing Periods. Bills for solid waste services will be
rendered monthly, or as otherwise stated, in the rate schedule and shall
become due when rendered and be considered as received by the customer when
mailed or provided to the solid waste service address or some other place
mutually agreed upon. Non-receipt of bills by the customer shall not release
or diminish the obligation of the customer with respect to payment thereof.



   (G)   Delinquent Bills. Bills are due when rendered and become
delinquent if not paid within fifteen (15) days after the bill has been
mailed or provided to the customer for payment. Solid waste services may not
be discontinued until ten (10) working days after a written notice of the
delinquency in payment has been mailed or presented to the customer. Solid
waste services shall be restored only after the city has received payment for
all past-due bills and charges from the customer. There shall be no liability
of any kind against the city for the discontinuance of solid waste services
to a customer for that customer’s failure to pay the bills on time. Partial
payment of a bill of the solid waste services rendered will not be accepted
by the city, except by the city’s agreement thereof.



   (H)   Payment of Solid Waste Service Bills Concurrently. When solid
waste services are provided by the city, payment of any solid waste service
bill rendered by the city to a customer shall not be accepted by the city
without the simultaneous or concurrent payment of any other water, wastewater
or stormwater bill rendered by the city. The city may discontinue solid waste
service to the customer’s premises for non-payment of any other water,
wastewater or stormwater bill or if payment is not made concurrently. The
city shall not reestablish solid waste service until such time as all solid
waste, water, wastewater or stormwater service bills and all charges are paid.



   (I)   Tax Clause. Any tax which may be levied upon the city shall
not be incorporated into the rate for solid waste service but shall be shown
as a separate item on the city’s bills to its customers receiving such
service.



   (J)   Change of Occupancy. When a change of occupancy takes place on
any premises supplied by the city with solid waste service, written notice
thereof shall be given at the office of the city not less than three (3) days
prior to the date of change by the outgoing customer. The outgoing customer
shall be held responsible for all solid waste services rendered on such
premises until such written notice is so received by the city and the city
has had reasonable time to discontinue the solid waste services. However, if
such written notice has been received, the application of such a succeeding
occupant for solid waste services will automatically terminate the prior
account. The customer’s deposit may be transferred from one service
location to another, if both locations are supplied solid waste services by
the city. The customer’s deposit may be transferred from one name to
another as long as the customer makes a written request.



   (K)   Adjustment of Bills. When a customer has been overcharged or
undercharged as a result of incorrect application or the rate schedule or
other similar reasons, the amount may be credited or billed to the customer
in accordance with the policies of the city.



   (L)   Suspension of Service.  A customer who will be away from the
serviced property for more than two months may request a suspension of
service and billing.  This request shall be made in writing and shall be
made in advance of the time period for which the suspension is being
requested.  A reactivation fee shall be set at the prevailing rate
established pursuant to resolution.



   (M)   Joint Billing. The monthly charges to any premises for solid
waste services shall be billed monthly on a single bill or statement where
the city has deemed this arrangement as beneficial to the customers.



   (N)   Provisions of Chapter Cumulative. The provisions of this
chapter shall be supplemental to all ordinances of the city, and the
provisions of this chapter shall be cumulative to all other remedies provided
by law or ordinance for the collection of unpaid solid waste bills.



(Ord. 2010-20, passed 7-15-10; Am. Ord. 2014-38, passed 8-21-14)



§ 150.51  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.



   (A)   Establishment of Credit. Before rendering solid waste
services, the city shall require an applicant for service to satisfactorily
establish credit, but such establishment of credit shall not relieve the
customer from complying with the city’s rules for prompt payment. Credit
will be deemed so established if:



      (1)   The applicant for service furnishes a satisfactory
guarantor to secure payment of bills for service requested.



      (2)   The applicant pays a cash deposit.



      (3)   The applicant for service furnishes an irrevocable
letter of credit from a bank or a surety bond.



   Any such deposit received by the city shall be held in a non-interest
bearing account. Deposits shall not be refunded until any and all outstanding
charges for solid waste services against the account for which it is
deposited have been paid in full. The deposits required under this section
shall be applied against the final bill prepared for termination of the
account. If the deposit exceeds the final bill, and no other outstanding fees
or charges exist, then the balance of the deposit shall be refunded. If a
customer has a record of timely payment over a continuous thirty-six (36)
month period, then the city shall return that deposit.



   (B)   Amount of Deposit. The amount of initial deposit for each
customer shall be set at the prevailing rate established pursuant to
resolution.



   (C)   Deposit Waiver. As established in the Utility Deposit Policy,
the applicant may apply for a credit screening to determine if a deposit is
required or if the amount of the deposit can be reduced or waived.  Actual
cost of a credit check fee when provided by a third-party will be imposed
upon the applicant.



      Third-Party Credit Check Fee: $5.00



   (D)   Additional Deposit. The city may require a new deposit, where
previously waived or returned, or an additional deposit in order to secure
payment of current bills provided. The city shall provide the customer with
reasonable written notice of not less than thirty (30) days where such
request or notice is separate and apart from any bill for service. The total
amount of the required solid waste deposit shall not exceed an amount equal
to two times the monthly charge for solid waste service.



(Ord. 2010-20, passed 7-15-10; Am. Ord. 2014-27, passed 7-17-14)



§ 150.52  DISCONTINUING AND REESTABLISHING SERVICE.



   (A)   There shall be a charge for discontinuing and reestablishing
from the name of one person to the name of another, which shall be paid
before the service is reestablished; provided, however, that there shall be
no service charge when the original service is established.



      (1)   Reestablishing Service. The charge for reestablishment
of service subsequent to a customer requested discontinuance, shall be set at
the prevailing rate established by resolution for reestablishment of service
that occur both during normal working hours and after normal working hours.



      (2)   Reestablishment as a Result of Nonpayment. When service
is discontinued because of nonpayment of amounts due, the reestablishment fee
shall be based on the actual costs incurred by the city, but shall not be
less than the prevailing rates set for reestablishment performed during
normal working hours and after normal working hours.



(Ord. 2010-20, passed 7-15-10)



§ 150.53  RATES.



   Rates for solid waste collection service are set at the prevailing rate
as established pursuant to resolution.



(Ord. 2010-20, passed 7-15-10)



§ 150.98  LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION AND INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions
shall be considered as a minimum requirement, liberally construed in favor of
the city, and deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted
under state law. This chapter is cumulative and supplemental to existing city
laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.



(Ord. 2010-20, passed 7-15-10)



§ 150.99  PENALTY.



   Any person, firm, corporation, business, agent, or other entity
violating any provision of this chapter, upon conviction thereof, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S.
§§ 775.082 or 775.083.  This provisions shall not apply to delinquent
bills.

opportunity to understand and try to mitigate any real or perceived impacts
their application may have on the community.

interested citizens, city staff, appointed and elected officials throughout
the applicant review process.



      (4)   The citizen participation plan is not intended to
produce complete consensus on all



applicants, but to encourage applicants to be good neighbors and to allow for
informed decision-making.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   Every application for development that requires a
preliminary subdivision approval, preliminary planned unit development, or a
conditional use shall include a citizen participation plan that must be
implemented prior to the first public hearing or notice of public review and
comment period on an administrative application.

§ 169.006  ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.



   (A)   Administrative review.  To hear and decide appeals where it
is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Growth Management Director in the enforcement of
the city's land development regulations.



   (B)   Hearings; appeals; notice.  Appeals to City Council may be
taken by any person aggrieved by any decision of the Growth Management
Director in the interpretation of any portion of these regulations. Such
appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time not to exceed sixty (60) days,
by filing with the city a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.
The Growth Management Director shall forthwith transmit to the City Clerk all
papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
The City Council shall hear  the appeal at a regularly scheduled or special
City Council meeting within thirty (30) days and give public notice thereof

(Ord. 2007-93, passed 10-18-07)



§ 169.009  VARIANCES.



   (A)   The City Council shall hear petitions for variances from the
terms of the Land Development Code delineated in §§ 170.114, 170.142, and
Chapters 178 and 185, or pursuant to §§ 174.023, 175.03(H), and 180.17, as
will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, the enforcement of the provisions of the city’s land
development regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.



   (B)   Upon receipt from the Planning and Zoning Board of a
recommendation concerning disposition of a requested variance, the City
Council shall hold a public hearing and may grant, deny or grant with
conditions any variance request upon finding that the request meets the
following criteria:



      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same land use
category, zoning district or situation.



      (2)   The special conditions and circumstances identified in
paragraph (1) above are not the result of actions of the applicant.



      (3)   Literal interpretation and enforcement of the
development code regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly
enjoyed by other properties in the same land use category, zoning district or
situation under the terms of the development code, and would work unnecessary
and undue hardship on the applicant.



      (4)   The variance, if granted, is the minimum variance
necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or
structure.



      (5)   Granting of the variance request will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the development code to
other lands, buildings or structures in the same land use category, zoning
district or situation.



      (6)   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general intent and purpose of this code, and will not be injurious to the
surrounding properties or detrimental to the public welfare.



      (7)   The variance represents a reasonable disposition of a
claim brought under the Bert J. Harris Private Property Rights Protection
Act, chapter 95-181, Laws of Florida, that a development order of the city
has unreasonably burdened the applicant’s property, based upon the
recommendations of the special master appointed in accordance with the act,
or the order of a court as described in the act.



   The above criteria shall be used to determine the justification for
granting of relief from requirements of the development code. All variance
requests shall demonstrate the application of each criterion to the specific
case.



   (C)   Financial disadvantages or inconvenience to the applicant
shall not of themselves constitute conclusive evidence of unnecessary and
undue hardship and be grounds to justify granting of a variance. 



   (D)   Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, variances may be
granted under the authority of the Americans with Disabilities Act as
reasonable accommodations based on the disabilities of any applicant or a
member of the applicant’s household. For purposes herein, “reasonable
accommodation” and “disabilities” shall have the meanings provided
under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 



   (E)   Conditions of approval.



      (1)   Conditions and safeguards.  In granting any variance,
appropriate conditions and safeguards may be prescribed to ensure compliance
with the requirements of the Land Development Code and the code in general.
Such conditions may include time limits for the initiation of the variance,
specific minimum or maximum limits to regular code requirements, or any other
conditions reasonably related to the requirements and criteria of this
chapter.



      (2)   Transfer of Variances.  Variances run with the property
and the use of a variance may be transferred to another party for use on the
same property. 



   (F)   Violation of variance terms or conditions.  It is a violation
of this code for any person to violate or to refuse to comply with any term
or condition of a variance. Violations may be enforced or prosecuted as
provided for in the Palm Bay Code of Ordinances.



   (G)   Approval may be given for variances to any principal,
accessory, or other structure up to twelve (12) inches administratively. Such
applications will be made by the property owner to the Chief Building
Official for review and approval. All variances approved by the Chief
Building Official shall be counter-signed by the Director of Growth
Management or designee. Approval of administrative variances shall be
submitted to the City Clerk for recording in the official records of Brevard
County at the sole expense of the property owner.

('74 Code, § 8-219)  (Ord. 89-03, passed 3-3-89)



§ 171.05  FEE TO BE IMPOSED ON IMPACT GENERATING LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.



   (A)   Fee obligation at commencement of land development activity;
fee determined and paid at issuance of building permit.



      (1)   After the effective date of this subchapter, any person
who shall commence any impact- generating land development activity as herein
defined shall be obligated to pay an impact fee upon the commencement of such
land development activity. The fee shall be determined and paid to the city
at the time of issuance of a building permit for the development. If the
building permit is for less than the entire development, the fee shall be
computed separately for the amount of development covered by the permit. If
the fee is exacted for impact generating land development activity that
increases impact because of a change or increase in use, the fee shall be
determined by computing the difference in the fee schedule between the new
land development activity and the existing land development activity.



      (2)   Any developer who prior to the effective date of this
subchapter agreed as a condition of development approval to pay impact fees,
shall be responsible for the payment of the fees under the terms of such
agreement and the payment of such fees by the developer will be offset
against any impact fees otherwise due at later stages of the land development
activity for which the fee was paid. Any portion of impact fees agreed to be
paid pursuant to a prior agreement that is greater than the fee established
in this subchapter shall be refunded.



      (3)   Any land or facilities agreed to be dedicated to the
city as a condition of development approval shall be dedicated by either
easement or deed, at the discretion of the City Manager, no later than the
time of building permit issuance.



   (B)   Fee agreement providing for payment of fee. At any time prior
to issuance of a building permit, the owner of property may enter into a fee
agreement with the city providing for a credit or payment of the fee pursuant
to the terms of this subchapter.



   (C)   Establishment of fee schedule.



      (1)   (a)   Any person who shall initiate any new
impact-generating land development activity, except those preparing an
individual assessment of fiscal impact or those receiving an interpretation
of the impact of their proposed land development activity shall pay an
impact. Impact fees shall be established by the City Council by resolution.



         (b)   The fees identified in the resolution shall be
adjusted annually by the change reflected in the Implicit Price Deflator for
State and Local Government Consumption Expenditures and Investment as
prepared by the United States Department of Commerce from the previous
year.  The adjustment shall take effect October 1 each year.



         (c)   If a building permit is requested for mixed uses,
then the fee shall be determined according to the impact fee schedule within
the resolution by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the
schedule.



      (2)   Biannually, and at the same time the City Council
reviews the budget and capital improvement element of the Palm Bay
Comprehensive Plan, the City Manager shall recommend to the City Council
whether any changes should be made to the impact fee schedule to reflect
changes in the factors that affect the fee schedule. The purpose of this
review is to analyze the effects of inflation on the actual costs of
facilities and to insure that the fee charged new impact generating land
development activity will not exceed its pro rata share for the reasonably
anticipated expansion costs of facilities necessitated by its presence.



      (3)   The fees identified in the impact fee schedule within
the resolution shall be adjusted annually by the amount of change reflected
in the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index from the
previous year. The adjustment shall take effect October 1 each year.

§ 171.06  INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF FISCAL IMPACT.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   The impact fee shall be computed by the use of an
individual assessment of fiscal impact if:



         (a)   The type of land development being commenced is
not one of those types listed on the fee schedule in § 171.05(C); or



         (b)   The feepayer chooses to have the amount of the fee
determined by the use of an individual assessment of fiscal impact; or



         (c)   The city staff's analysis of the proposed land
development activity concludes that the nature, timing or location of the
proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts costing
substantially more to remediate than the amount of the fee that would be
generated by the use of the fee schedule.



      (2)   The developer shall be responsible for preparation of
the individual assessment of fiscal impact if the developer chooses to
conduct the analysis. The City Manager shall be responsible for preparation
of the individual assessment of fiscal impact if the type of land development
being proposed is interpreted not to be one of those types listed in the fee
schedule or analysis of the proposed land development activity concludes that
the nature, timing or location of the proposed development make it likely to
generate impacts costing substantially more than the amount of the fee
generated by the use of the fee schedule. The person who prepares the
individual assessment of fiscal impact shall be a qualified professional in
the preparation of impact analysis, and shall be approved by the City Manager
on the basis of professional training and experience. If the City Manager is
responsible for preparation of the assessment, the City Manager may request
the developer to prepare the individual assessment of fiscal impact, and
credit the cost for such preparation against the impact fee.



   (B)   The park component.  The individual assessment of fiscal
impact for the park component shall determine if the proposed land
development activity is designed or located so that the occupants of the
development will use capital park facilities less than that projected in the
park component.



   (C)   The police component.  The individual assessment of fiscal
impact for the police component shall determine if the proposed land
development activity is designed or located so that the development will not
demand the use of capital police facilities from that projected in the police
component.



   (D)   The fire component.  The individual assessment of fiscal
impact for the fire component shall determine if the proposed land
development activity is designed or located so that the development will not
demand the use of capital fire facilities other than that projected in the
fire component.



   (E)   Procedure for review of application for assessment of fiscal
impact.



      (1)   An individual assessment of fiscal impact shall be
undertaken through the submission of an application of assessment of fiscal
impact for the facility component for which an assessment is requested. A
developer may submit such an application at his discretion. The city shall
submit such an application for any proposed land development activity
interpreted as not one of those types listed on the fee schedule, and for any
proposed land development activity for which it concludes the nature, timing,
or location of the proposed development make it likely to generate impacts
costing substantially more to remediate than the amount of the fee that would
be generated by the use of the fee schedule.



      (2)   Within twenty (20) days of receipt of an application of
assessment of fiscal impact, the City Manager shall determine if the
application is complete.  If the City Manager determines that the
application is not complete, a written statement specifying the deficiencies
shall be mailed to the person submitting the application. The application
shall be deemed complete if no deficiencies are specified.  The City Manager
shall take no further action on the application until it is deemed complete.



      (3)   When the City Manager determines the application is
complete, a written decision shall be rendered in thirty (30) days on whether
the fee should be modified, and if so, what the amount should he.



      (4)   If on the basis of generally recognized principles of
impact analysis it is determined the data, information and assumptions used
by the applicant to calculate the assessment of fiscal impact for either the
park, police or fire component satisfies the requirements of this section,
the fee determined in the assessment of fiscal impact shall be deemed the fee
due and owing for the proposed land development activity. The adjustment
shall be set forth in a fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to
§ 171.05(B).



   (F)   Appeal of decision on application of assessment of fiscal
impact.  Any person may appeal the City Manager's decision on the
applicant's application for assessment of fiscal impact, or on an application
for assessment of fiscal impact initiated by the city staff on any proposed
land development activity, by filing a petition with the City Council. In
reviewing the City Manager's decision, the City Council shall make written
findings of fact and conclusions of law and use the standards established in
divisions (B) through (D) above, whichever is applicable.



('74 Code, § 8-221)  (Ord. 89-03, passed 3-3-89)



§ 171.07  CREDITS.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   Any person who shall initiate any impact-generating land
development activity may apply for a credit against any fee for capital park,
police or fire facility impacts proposed to be paid pursuant to the
provisions of this subchapter for any contribution, payment, construction, or
dedication of land accepted and received by the city for capital park, police
or fire facilities, as defined in § 171.03, including any contribution,
payment, construction or dedication made pursuant to a development order
issued by the city pursuant to its local development regulations, Fla. Stat.
§ 380.06, or any additional development requirement imposed by the Florida
Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission on a development of regional impact.



      (2)   Credit for contributions, payments, construction or
dedications of an impact fee component shall not be transferable to another
component. Credit shall be transferable within the same component and within

issued, along with interest of six percent (6%) a year. Provided, however,
that the City Council may by resolution extend for up to three (3) years the
date at which fees must be refunded. Such an extension shall be made upon a
finding that within such three (3) year period, specific capital improvements
are planned and evidenced by the adoption and incorporation into the city's
comprehensive plan, that these capital improvements shall be constructed
within the next three (3) years, that these improvements are reasonably
attributable to the feepayer's land development activity, and that the fees
whose time of refund is extended shall be spent for these capital
improvements. Fees shall be deemed to be spent on the basis of the first fee
collected shall be the first fee spent.



         (b)   The refund of fees shall be undertaken through the
following process:



            1.   A refund application shall be submitted
within one (1) year following the end of the sixth year from the date on

specifying the deficiencies shall be mailed to the person submitting the
application. Unless the deficiencies are corrected, the City Manager shall
take no further action on the refund application.



      (3)   When the City Manager determines the refund application
is complete, the refund shall be approved within thirty (30) days if it is
determined the feepayer or any successor in interest has paid a fee that the
city has not spent within the period of time permitted under this section.
The refund shall include the fee paid plus interest of six percent (6%) a
year.



      (4)   Any feepayer, or any successor in interest, may appeal
the decision of a refund application by filing a petition with the City

TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IMPACT FEE



§ 171.25  SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “City
of Palm Bay Fair Share Transportation Facilities Impact Fee Ordinance.”



   (B)   The City Council has the authority to adopt this subchapter
pursuant to Fla. Const.  Art VIII, Fla. Stat. Ch. 166 and Fla. Stat. §§
163.3201, 163.3202, and 380.06(16).



   (C)   This subchapter shall apply to all lands within the municipal
boundaries of the city.

§ 171.26  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   Planning for the necessary capacity expansion of the city's
major transportation system to ensure the safety and efficiency of the city's
roads and to provide for the health, safety, welfare, and economic well being
of the citizens of the city is the mandated responsibility of the city
pursuant to Fla. Stat. §§ 163.3161 et seq., the Florida Local Government
Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, and Fla. Stat.
§§ 166.011 et seq., the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act.



   (B)   This subchapter is intended to implement and be consistent
with the city comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to Fla. Stat. §§ 163.3161
et seq., the Florida Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land
Development Regulation Act.



   (C)   This objective is accomplished by requiring all new land
development activity generating traffic that places additional demand on the
major transportation system to contribute its proportionate share of the
funds, land, or public facilities to accommodate any transportation impacts
having a rational nexus to the proposed development and for which the need is
reasonably attributable to the proposed development.



   (D)   It is not the purpose of this subchapter for the city to
collect any funds, land or public facilities from new land development
activity generating traffic in excess of the actual amount necessary to
offset the increased demand on the major transportation system generated by
the new land development activity generating traffic. This subchapter is
intended to be consistent with the principles for allocating a fair share of
the cost of the new public facilities to new users as established in
Contractors and Builders Association of Pinellas County v. City of Dunedin,
324 So. 2d 314 (Fla. 1976), and Homebuilders and Contractors Association of
Palm Beach County v. Palm Beach County, 446 So. 2d 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983).

§ 171.29  FEE TO BE IMPOSED ON LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY GENERATING TRAFFIC.



   (A)   Fee determined and paid at issuance of building permit.



      (1)   After the effective date of this subchapter, any person
who shall commence any land development activity generating traffic that
creates an increased demand on the major road network system shall be
obligated to pay a fair share transportation facilities impact fee upon the
commencement of such land development activity generating traffic in the
manner and the amount set forth herein. The impact fee shall be determined
and paid to the city at the time of issuance of a building permit for the
development unless otherwise provided herein. No building permit shall be
final until any applicable impact fee has been paid and the development
complies with all provisions of this code of ordinances. If the building
permit is for less than the entire development, the impact fee shall be
computed separately for the amount of development covered by the building
permit. The obligation to pay the impact fee shall run with the land. If the
impact fee is due to be paid for land development activity generating traffic
that increases the impact because of a change or increase in use, the impact
fee shall be determined by computing the difference in the fee schedule
between the new land development activity generating traffic and the existing
land development activity.



         (a)   Agreement in lieu of payment.



            1.   In lieu of payment at the time of issuance of
the building permit, non-residential, mixed use and multi-family land
development activity may defer payment until the time of the certificate of
occupancy, providing such payment is guaranteed through the execution of an
Impact Fee Payment Agreement.  In this case, the City will not issue the
Certificate of Occupancy until the impact fee due has been paid.



            2.   The Developer shall be required to pay the
impact fee rates applicable at the time the payment is made.



         (b)   Shell building.  In those instances where a
Developer has constructed a non-residential shell building, the payment may
be deferred until the time of occupancy or three (3) years from the date of
the Certificate of Occupancy, whichever comes first, providing such payment
is guaranteed through the execution of an Impact Fee Payment Agreement.



         (c)   Economic development incentives.  The City
Council may, by Resolution, establish criteria for impact fee mitigation.



         (d)   Early payment.  Payments made in full prior to
issuance of a building permit may be made.  Such payment amount shall be
calculated based on the applicable fees effective at the time of payment. 
Fee increases following such payment shall not be retroactive for the project
paying such fees.  Any differential due at building permit issuance because
of change in use or size of the project shall be calculated at the time of
permit issuance.  Such early payments are not subject to refund but may be
credited to the land for a future project.



      (2)   Any developer who, prior to the effective date of this
subchapter, agreed as a condition of development approval to pay city
transportation impact fees, shall be responsible for the payment of the
impact fees under the terms of such agreement, and the payment of such impact
fees by the developer to the city will be offset against any transportation
impact fees otherwise due at later stages of the land development activity
for which the impact fee was paid. Any portion of transportation impact fees
agreed to be paid to the city pursuant to a prior agreement that are greater
than the impact fee established in this subchapter shall be refunded.



      (3)   Any traffic-related land agreed to be dedicated to the
city as a condition of development approval shall be dedicated by either
easement deed or warranty deed, at the option of the city, no later than the
time of building permit issuance, and shall be eligible for a credit in
accordance with the provisions of § 171.31.



   (B)   Fee agreement providing for credit towards the payment of fee.
At any time prior to issuance of a building permit, the developer may enter
into a fee agreement with the city providing for a credit towards the payment
of the impact fee pursuant to the terms of this subchapter.



   (C)   Establishment of fee schedule.



      (1)   Any developer who is issued a building permit, except
those preparing an individual traffic impact analyses of their proposed land
development activity, shall pay an impact fee. Impact fees shall be
established by the City Council by resolution.



      (2)   Biannually, and at the same time the City Council
reviews the budget and capital improvement element of the city comprehensive
plan, the City Manager or his designee shall recommend to the City Council
whether any changes should be made to the impact fee schedule to reflect
changes in the factors that affect the impact fee schedule. The purpose of
this review is to insure that the impact fee charged of new land development
activity generating traffic will not exceed its pro rata share for the
reasonably anticipated expansion costs of transportation facilities
necessitated by its presence.



      (3)   The fees identified in the impact fee schedule within
the resolution shall be adjusted annually by the amount of change reflected
in the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index from the
previous year.  The adjustment shall take effect October 1 each year.

§ 171.30  INDIVIDUAL TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   The impact fee shall be computed by the use of an
individual traffic impact analysis of land development activity generating
traffic on the major road network system, if:



         (a)   The type of land development being commenced is
not one of those types listed on the impact fee scheduled in § 171.29(C); or



         (b)   The feepayer chooses to have the amount of the
impact fee determined by the use of an individual traffic impact analysis; or



         (c)   The city's analysis concludes that the proposed
development is likely to generate impacts costing more to remediate than the
amount of the impact fee established by the impact fee schedule.



      (2)   The developer shall be responsible to prepare the
individual traffic impact analysis if the developer chooses to conduct the
analysis. The city shall prepare the individual traffic impact analysis if
the proposed development is interpreted not to be one listed in the impact
fee schedule or if the analysis of the proposed development concludes that it
is likely to generate impacts costing substantially more than the amount of
the impact fee established by the impact fee schedule. The person who
prepares such analysis shall be a qualified professional in the preparation
of impact analysis and shall be approved by the City Manager or his designee
on the basis of professional training and experience. If the city is
responsible to prepare the individual traffic impact analysis, it may require
the developer to prepare it and credit the cost of such preparation against
the impact fee. If the city pays such cost, it shall be deducted from the
cost of the developer's impact fee.



   (B)   Procedure for review of application for traffic impact
analyses.



      (1)   The individual traffic impact analysis shall be
undertaken through the submission of an application of traffic impact
analysis which shall include the following information:



         (a)   The projected trip generation rates for the
proposed land development activity. Trip generation rates shall be assessed
on an average daily trip. The trip generation rates shall be based upon
either local empirical surveys of trip generation rates for the same or
similar land use types or state or national trip generation rate information,
if applicable; and



         (b)   The proposed trip length of the trips generated
from the proposed land development activity onto the major road network
system. Trip length information shall be based upon local empirical surveys
of similar land use types or trip length data compiled by the City Manager or
his designee for average trip length for similar land use types; and



         (c)   The proposed percentage of new trips on the major
road network system which are generated by the proposed land development
activity. The percentage of new trips shall be based upon local empirical
surveys of similar land use types or state or national percentage of new
trips information if applicable or other reliable percentage of new trips
information acceptable to the City Manager, if applicable; and



         (d)   An assessment of the capital expansion of the
major road network system necessitated by the proposed land development
activity if it is to be maintained at level of service C on an average annual
basis. Practices and methodological procedures generally accepted in the
transportation planning and engineering profession acceptable by the City
Manager or his designee shall be used to determine the capital expansion of
the major road network system necessitated by the proposed land development
activity; and



         (e)   An assessment of the costs for providing the
capital expansion necessitated by the proposed land development activity. The
cost figures used shall be based upon recent empirical information of the
costs in the city for the construction of a lane mile and shall include
related right-of-way costs, and the planning, design, and engineering costs
for the necessary capital improvements; and



         (f)   An assessment of the projected gas and license tax
revenues or any other revenues that will be derived from the proposed land
development activity that can be reasonably determined to be available to pay
for new capital improvements to the major road network system over the
planning horizon; and



         (g)   The amount of any shortfall between the projected
gas, license tax, any other revenues, and the capital expansion costs for the
major road network system necessitated by the new land development activity
generating traffic. Any shortfall shall be considered the proposed fair share
transportation facilities impact fee for the proposed land development
activity.



      (2)   Within twenty (20) days of receipt of an application of
traffic impact analysis or a revised application, the City Manager or his
designee shall determine if it is complete. If the City Manager or his
designee determines that an application or revised application is not
complete, he shall send a written statement specifying the deficiencies by
mail to the person submitting the application. Unless the deficiencies are
corrected, the City Manager or his designee shall take no further action on
the traffic impact analysis.



      (3)   When the City Manager or his designee determines the
application is complete, within thirty (30) days he shall review it and
render a written report indicating whether the fee stated in § 171.29(C) is
to be varied to accommodate the activity generated by the proposed
development.



      (4)   If, on the basis of generally accepted principles of
traffic engineering, it is determined in the traffic impact analysis that the
city's cost to accommodate the proposed land development activity is
substantially different than the fee stated in § 171.29(C), the amount of
the fair share transportation facilities impact fee shall be varied from that
established in the impact fee schedule to an amount consistent with the
amount determined in the traffic impact analysis.



   (C)   Appeal of decision on application of traffic impact
analysis.  Any developer submitting an application for traffic impact
analysis may appeal the City Manager's findings in the report submitted
pursuant to division (B)(3) above, by filing a petition together with a
thirty dollar ($30.00) filing/ application fee with the City Council within
thirty (30) days of the decision by the City Manager.  In reviewing the City
Manager's findings, the City Council shall, at a public hearing held within
sixty (60) days from the date of the application, make written findings of
fact and conclusions of law based upon the standards established in division
(B) above.

§ 171.32  IMPACT FEE DISTRICT.



   There is established one (1) impact fee district which encompasses and
is equal to the municipal boundaries of the city.



('74 Code, § 15-88)  (Ord. 91-10, passed 5-16-91)



§ 171.33  USE OF FUNDS.



   (A)   Intent.  Any impact fees collected under this subchapter are
expressly designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable
to the increased demand of proposed land development activity generating
traffic as hereinafter provided in this section.



   (B)   Administrative costs.  The city shall be entitled to actual
administrative costs not to exceed two percent (2%) of the funds collected as
compensation for the administrative expense of collecting and administering
these impact fee regulations.  All remaining funds collected from impact
fees shall be deposited into the fair share transportation facilities impact
fee trust fund.



   (C)   Establishment of trust fund. There is established the Palm Bay
Fair Share Transportation Facilities Impact Fee Trust Fund for the purpose of
insuring that the impact fees collected pursuant to this subchapter are
designated for the accommodation of impacts reasonably attributable to the
proposed land development activity generating traffic.



   (D)   Expenditure of fees in trust fund. Proceeds from the trust
fund and interest accrued on such fund shall be used for capital expansion of
the major road network system and in a manner consistent with the city
comprehensive plan. Proceeds collected from the trust fund and all interest
accrued on such funds may also be used for periodic engineering and planning
studies to update the fee structure as may be required from time to time.



   (E)   Investment of fees in interest bearing accounts.  Any funds
in the trust fund on deposit, not immediately necessary for expenditure,
shall be invested in interest bearing accounts. All income derived from these
investments shall be retained in the trust fund. These monies shall be
utilized for the capital expansion of the major road network system.



   (F)   Annual recommendation for expenditure of fees. At least once a
year, at the time the annual city budget is reviewed, the City Manager shall
propose to the City Council appropriations to be spent from the trust fund.
After review of the City Manager's recommendation, the City Council shall
either approve, modify, or deny the recommended expenditures of the trust
fund monies for road improvements. Any amounts not appropriated from the
trust fund together with any interest earnings shall be carried over in the
trust fund to the next review period.



   (G)   Return of fees if not spent for capital improvements.



      (1)   Any impact fees collected shall be returned to the
feepayer or his successor in interest if the impact fees have not been spent
within seven (7) years from the date the building permit for the development
was issued, along with interest of six percent (6%) a year; except that the
city shall retain three percent (3%) of the fee to offset the costs of
refunding. The City Council may, by resolution, extend for up to three (3)
years the date at which fees must be refunded. Such an extension shall be
made upon a finding that within such three (3) year period, specific capital
improvements are planned and evidenced by the adoption and incorporation into
the city's comprehensive plan that these capital improvements shall be
constructed within the next three (3) years, that these improvements are
reasonably attributable to the feepayer's land development activity
generating traffic, and that the impact fees which time of refund is extended
shall be spent for these capital improvements. Impact fees shall be deemed to
be spent on the basis of the first impact fee collected shall be the first
impact fee spent. The refund of impact fees shall be undertaken through the
following process:



         (a)   A refund application shall be submitted within one
(1) year following the end of the seven (7) years from the date on which the
building permit was issued on the proposed development. If the time of refund
has been extended pursuant to division (1) above, the refund application
shall be submitted within one (1) year following the end of this extension.



         (b)   The refund application shall include the following
information:



            1.   A copy of the dated receipt issued for
payment of the fee;



            2.   A copy of the building permit; and, if
applicable;



            3.   Evidence that the applicant is the successor
in interest to the feepayer.



      (2)   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the refund
application, the City Manager or his designee shall determine if it is
complete. If the City Manager or his designee determines the application is
not incomplete, a written statement specifying the deficiencies shall be
mailed to the person submitting the application. Unless the deficiencies are
corrected, the City Manager or his designee shall take no further action on
the refund application.



      (3)   When the City Manager or his designee determines the
refund application is complete, the refund shall be approved within thirty
(30) days if it is determined the feepayer or any successor in interest has
paid an impact fee that the city has not spent within the period of time
permitted under this section. The refund shall include the impact fee paid
plus interest of six percent (6%) a year less the three percent (3%)
administrative fee.



      (4)   Any feepayer or any successor in interest may appeal the
decision of a refund application by filing a petition with the City Council
within thirty (30) days of the decision. In reviewing the City Manager's
decision, the City Council shall use the standards established in division
(1)(a) above.



   (H)   Refund of impact fees paid upon non- commencement of
development activity.



      (1)   Any impact fees collected shall be returned to the
feepayer or his successor in interest if the developer so requests and upon
cancellation of all building permits.  Such refund shall not include
interest earned and a three percent (3%) administrative fee shall be retained
by the City.  Impact fees may be refunded for a period up to two (2) years
from payment date.  After that period, no refunds can be requested.

WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES



§ 171.50  WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES.



   (A)   Adoption.  The City hereby adopts and establishes pursuant to
general law, a water capital charge, and a wastewater capital charge as set
forth in paragraph (1) herein below, the purpose of which will be to finance
capital expenditures and the payment of City indebtedness associated with the
expansion of the City's water supply, treatment and transmission system, the
wastewater transmission, treatment, and effluent disposal system, and the
reclaimed treatment and transmission system.



      (1)   Implementation.  The amount of each capital charge per
equivalent residential connection (ERC) shall be effective October 1, 2015 as
follows:



 


Date

 

Water Capital Charge

 

Wastewater Capital Charge

$2,151.39

 

$3,139.20




 



      (2)   All capital charge amounts listed in subsection (1)
above will be increased annually on October 1st of every year according to
the Engineering News Record (ENR) City Cost Index for the Southeast region.



   (B)   Applicability.  Except for those customers who have
previously paid plant capacity charges to the previous owner of the utility
and having previously been connected to the System, the capital charges set
forth herein shall be paid by those new customers who (1) connect to said
System, (2) request service from the City, or (3) request an increase in
water and/or wastewater service capacity. The City may exempt any customer
from the payment of all or a portion of the water and wastewater capital
charges to the extent that the City accepts a permanent contribution in aid
of construction related to the water supply, treatment or transmission
facilities or the wastewater transmission, treatment, or effluent disposal
facilities having a value of not less than the portion of the water or
wastewater capital charges being exempted.



   (C)   Time of payment.  All water and wastewater capital charges
shall be paid prior to connection of a structure or structures to be served
by the City, or such other time as may be specifically provided by City
resolution, by City ordinance, by agreement, or permit; provided, however,
that the City may permit installment payments for owners of existing
single-family residences where utility services are available for any water,
or waste-water capital charges, and main line extension charges upon such
terms and conditions as the City deems appropriate. Installment payments
shall be paid in accordance with an Installment Payment Agreement approved by
the City and such Installment Payment Agreement shall be and constitute a
lien against the premises and shall become effective and binding as a lien
from the date the owner of the property and the City enter into the said
Installment Payment Agreement, such lien shall remain a lien co-equal with
the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in
dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid and shall bear
interest annually at a rate not to exceed the legal rate allowed for such
liens and may be foreclosed pursuant to the procedure set forth in Fla. Stat.
Chapter 173. Furthermore, the balance due on any such installment agreement
shall become immediately due and payable upon the sale or transfer of
interest of the property by the Customer to any other person or entity or
upon refinancing of the property. For purposes of this subchapter, transfer
of interest shall be defined as set forth in any Installment Payment
Agreement entered into pursuant to this subchapter.



      (1)   When the utility applicant is not required to obtain a
State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection permit to connect
proposed water, wastewater and/or reuse water treatment or transmission
facilities to the City's utility system, all utility charges and fees shall
be paid at or before the time of application for water, wastewater, and/or
reuse service.



      (2)   When the applicant must obtain a Florida Department of
Environmental Protection permit to connect proposed facilities to the utility
system for a residential project equal to or greater than 100 Equivalent
Residential Connections (ERCs), a payment in an amount equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the amount of capital connection charges as set forth by
City Code attributable to a proposed development to be ultimately constructed
shall be payable to the City within thirty (30) days after final approval of
the Florida Department of Environmental Protection application. In the event
a permit application is denied by the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, the City shall, upon request of the applicant, refund only the
capital connection charges paid by the applicant for the denied permit
application. If a valid Department of Environmental Protection permit expires
prior to construction of the utility system and acceptance of conveyance
thereof by the City, or if a permit has expired, then the applicant shall be
entitled to a refund less a five percent (5%) administrative fee based on
total funds paid to the City. The City shall not be further obligated to the
applicant or the applicant's heirs, assigns or successors to provide the
utility capacity. Additionally, upon denial or expiration of a permit, and
upon request of the applicant, all bonds or letters of credit posted
hereunder shall be released by the City. The remainder seventy-five percent
(75%) of all fees and charges due the City for connecting the development to
the utility system is due and payable within five (5) business days after
final plat approval by the City. Residential projects of less than 100
Equivalent Residential Connections shall be exempt from the previously stated
requirement.



      (3)   The City shall be entitled to recover all costs,
including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees and/or collection
service charges, incurred in collecting delinquent utility fees and charges.

      (2)   One equivalent residential connection (ERC) shall, for
purposes of this Section, have an assigned value of 1.00.  For wastewater
service capacity, one ERC is hereby established and determined to be equal to
a flow of 210 gallons per day, average annual basis (210 GPD), or such other
value as may be later, approved or determined by the Florida Department of
Environmental Regulation.



      (3)   For water service capacity, one ERC is hereby
established and determined to be equal to a flow of 225 gallons per day,
average annual basis (225 GPD).



      (4)   The "total equivalent residential connection value" for
an establishment shall be calculated by multiplying the ERC factor listed
above by the number of units.  The minimum ERC factor for each
non-residential establishment shall be one (1).



      (5)   For all establishments not listed above, the total
wastewater equivalent residential connection (ERC) value for wastewater
service capacity shall be determined by multiplying the number of fixture
units, as published in the Standard Plumbing Code, by fifteen (15), and then
dividing that numerator by two hundred ten (210).  For example:



Total Wastewater ERC Value = Number of Fixture Units x 15



               210 GPD/ERC



The wastewater capital charge shall be determined by using the following
formula:



Total ERC Value x wastewater prevailing rate = wastewater capital charge



      (6)   For all establishments not listed above, the total water
equivalent residential connection (ERC) value for water service capacity
shall be determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published
in the Standard Plumbing Code, by fifteen (15), and then dividing that
numerator by two hundred twenty-five (225).  For example:



Total ERC Value = Number of Fixture Units x 15



         225 GPD/ERC



The water capital charge shall be determined by using the following formula:



Total ERC Value x water prevailing rate = water capital charge



      (7)   Connections that have not paid the wastewater capital
charge and are not specifically exempt from paying the wastewater capital
charge are required to pay a wastewater capital charge recovery usage
component. The wastewater capital charge recovery usage component shall be
the rate as set forth in Table 1 below per one thousand (1,000) gallons of
water metered for wastewater billing purposes. These charges will continue to
be paid until such time that the wastewater capital charges in effect at time
of connection to the system are satisfied.



      (8)   Connections that have not paid the water capital charge
and are not specifically exempt from paying the water capital charge are
required to pay a water capital charge recovery usage component. The water
capital charge recovery usage component shall be the rate as set forth in
Table 1 below per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water metered for water
billing purposes. These charges will continue to be paid until such time that
the water capital charges in effect at time of connection to the system are
satisfied.



      (9)   The amount of each capital charge recovery usage
component shall be effective October 1, 2015 as follows:



 


Date

 

Water Capital Charge Recovery Usage Component

October 1, 2015

 

$1.34

 

$1.85




 



      (10)   All capital charge recovery usage components will be
increased annually on October 1st of every year according to the Engineering
News Record (ENR) City Cost Index for the Southeast region.



      (11)   The above ERC Schedule applies to establishments being
connected to the City of Palm Bay Utilities Water and Wastewater System.



   (E)   Capital improvement funds; establishment; expenditure
guidelines; application and pledge to revenue bonds.



      (1)   The water and water with reclaimed water capital charges
and capital charge recovery usage components collected pursuant to this
tariff shall be deposited into a fund called the "Connection Fee Fund". The
wastewater and wastewater with reclaimed water capital charges and capital
charge recovery usage component shall likewise be deposited into a fund
called the "Connection Fee Fund". The water and water with reclaimed water
capital charges and capital charge recovery usage component so deposited
shall be used only for the acquisition of the City's water system and all
components thereof and additions thereto, and the construction and
acquisition of additions and extensions to the City's water system and all
components thereof including raw water supply facilities, transmission
facilities, mains, ground storage facilities, new pumping facilities, water
treatment plants, and distribution facilities in order to provide additional
water treatment capacity or water service capacity to those new customers who
connect to the City's water system. The wastewater and wastewater with
reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge recovery usage component
so deposited in the above-mentioned fund shall be used only for the
acquisition of the City's wastewater system and all components thereof and
additions thereto, and the construction and acquisition of additions and
extensions to the City's wastewater system and all components thereof,
including collection facilities, transmission facilities, treatment
facilities, and effluent disposal facilities, in order to provide additional
sewage treatment capacity, effluent disposal capacity, or wastewater service
capacity to those new customers who connect to the City's wastewater
system.  The reclaimed water capital charges and capital charge recovery
usage components collected pursuant to this Tariff shall be deposited into a
fund called the "Connection Fee Fund". The reclaimed water capital charges
and capital charge recovery usage component so deposited shall be used only
for the acquisition of the City's reclaimed system and all components thereof
and additions thereto, and the construction and acquisition of additions and
extensions to the City's reclaimed system and all components thereof
including filtration facilities, disinfection facilities, storage tanks,
transmission facilities, mains, remote storage facilities, new pumping
facilities, and distribution facilities in order to provide additional
reclaimed treatment capacity or reclaimed service capacity to those new
customers who connect to the City's reclaimed system.



      (2)   The City may by resolution provide for the application
of some or all of the water, wastewater, and/or reclaimed water capital
charges to the payment or security for the payment of revenue bonds issued in
whole or in part for the purpose set out in Subsection (E)(1) hereof,
provided that the amount of water and/or wastewater capital charges applied
to the payment of such bonds shall not exceed the amount of bond proceeds
actually expended for such purpose with interest at the average rate borne by
said bonds. Such application or pledge may be made directly in the
proceedings authorizing such bonds or in an agreement with an insurer of
bonds to assure such insurer of additional security there for. 



   (F)   Application; allocation of water and/or wastewater service
capacity. The City may require all information on said application that it
deems reasonable and necessary, and may reject applications it determines are
incomplete. Any application for water and/or wastewater service shall contain
a legal description of the land constituting the service area for which the
said permit is to be issued. The legal description shall include only those
lands owned by the applicant for which the water and/or wastewater
developer's agreement is to serve. If any such person described hereinabove
fails to apply for and purchase water and/or wastewater service capacity
under these rules, the City Council may consider said failure in determining
whether or not to grant or deny any connection to the system. The City
Council shall by separate ordinance establish rules for the allocation of
water and/or wastewater service capacity, and may by resolution establish a
fee for application review payable by applicants.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 173.001  PURPOSE, FINDINGS, INTENT, AND INCORPORATION OF RECITALS.



   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments in order
to promote and protect the public health, safety, good order, morals and
general welfare of the citizens of the city, to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations of adult entertainment establishments and
sexually-oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing an unreasonable limitation or
unreasonable restriction on the content of any lawful communicative materials
including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent
nor effect of this chapter to unreasonably restrict or deny access by adults
to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented entertainment
protected by the First Amendment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this subchapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal material.



   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in Supreme Court
cases presented for consideration by the City Council in the record
supporting this chapter, including but not limited to City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), on
materials made of record relating to the St. Johns County Public Nudity
Ordinance, and on the substance of and findings made or incorporated in
studies accomplished in other communities and ordinances enacted in other
communities, including, but not limited to, New York, New York; City of
Houston Ordinance Number 97-75; Senate Bill Number 232, as passed by the
Kansas State Legislature; Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; St. Paul,
Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin,
Texas; Macon-Bibb County, Georgia; Palm Beach County, Florida; Manatee
County, Florida; the findings of the Attorney General of the State of
Minnesota; the report of United States Attorney General's Commission on
Pornography (1986); Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and "A Summary
of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult
Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning,
Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984; the
publication entitled "Protecting Communities From Sexually-Oriented
Businesses" (Southwest Legal Press, Inc.); the publication entitled "Local
Regulation Of Adult Businesses" (Clark, Boardman and Callaghan); publications
prepared by the Florida Family Association, Inc. (Tampa, Florida) relating to
the regulation of sexually-oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects
of sexually-oriented businesses; the "Report to: The American Center for Law
and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses", Peter R.
Hecht, Ph.D. (1996); and the findings of fact relating to the Adult
Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, and the findings of fact
relating to the Sexually-Oriented Business and Adult  Entertainment
Establishment Ordinance of Seminole County, Florida,  matters and materials
submitted at the public hearings relating to this Ordinance and other matters
and documents relating to all of the above; the City Council finds:



      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities
that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators
of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no
mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or
establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.



      (2)   Certain workers of certain sexually-oriented businesses
and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a
higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of
other business establishments.



      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal
sex, occur at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas,
booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having
physical interaction between workers and customers.



      (4)   Offering and providing such private spaces encourages
such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions.



      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades,
and other sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments
for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and
establishments.



      (6)   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread
by activities occurring in sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.



      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an
increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in
1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985, 253,448 through December 31, 1992 and
currently there are 1,400,000 people infected with the disease nationally
with 40,000 people becoming infected annually.



      (8)   As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported
cases of AIDS in the State of Florida with over 100,000 AIDS cases being
reported in the State of Florida from 1983 - 2005.  Florida ranks third in
cumulative AIDS cases in the United States and has the second highest AIDS
rate in the United States.



      (9)   From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons
testing positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to 73,217
in the twenty-eight (28) states having confidential reporting requirements.



      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year)
syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases
reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990 and between 2004 and
2005, the national syphilis rate increased eleven and one-tenths percent
(11.1%).



      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with over 500,000 cases being
reported in 1990 and currently 350,000 cases of gonorrhea are reported
annually with Florida reporting over 20,000 cases of gonorrhea annually.



      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States, in his report
of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse,
exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother
to her newborn.



      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.



      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part,
because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because
of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and
operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain
those facilities.



      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen
is found in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films which gives rise to
health and aesthetic concerns.



      (16)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (15)
above and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns.



      (17)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.



      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate
mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore
nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or
establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.



      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring
sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult theaters.



      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses and
adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current
workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain
types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such
businesses and establishments.



      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually-oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such
information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest
in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.



      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of
communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed
to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.



      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment
establishment or sexually-oriented business license has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.



      (24)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the
city and other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult
entertainment material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or
sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or
other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints,
videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual
representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or
instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate,
describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical
areas.



      (25)   Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the
city and other nearby cities or counties in Florida where adult entertainment
and sexually-oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude,
or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing
specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with
customers.



      (26)   Commercial sexually-oriented businesses exist or
operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or
counties in Florida where sexually-oriented services are offered for
commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact,
escort services and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers
of such sexually-oriented businesses operating in Florida engage in physical
contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of
prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness.



      (27)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and
businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as
such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good
order, health, safety, economy, property values, morals and general welfare
of the people, businesses and industries of the city.  A major industry
which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons
seeking to bring children to visit Palm Bay who wish to stay in a community
with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes.



      (28)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in
establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or
unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be
aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to,
prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious
behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials and an unhealthy and
unsanitary environment, possession, distribution and transportation of
obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent
crimes against persons and property.



      (29)   When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited
in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number
of transients, blight neighborhoods, discourage wholesome tourism, adversely
affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the
particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and
businesses to move to other locations.



      (30)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are
incongruous with other business signage,  lower the surrounding property
values and contribute to urban decline.



      (31)   The activities occurring at sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in
establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of
alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal
activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the
surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety
of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real
property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and
adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment.



      (32)   Physical contact or touching within sexually-oriented
businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting
specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both
and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases.



      (33)   In order to preserve and safeguard the good order,
health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is
necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners,
managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers
at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments.



      (34)   The potential dangers to the good order, morals,
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by
permitting a sexually-oriented business or adult entertainment establishment
to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license
under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such
establishments prior to their being permitted to operate.



      (35)   Requiring operators of sexually- oriented businesses
and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information
concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer
contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of
certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of
potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work
at or be customers in such establishments.



      (36)   Prohibiting sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of
educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or
designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily
found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the
activities that accompany such establishments and businesses.



      (37)   Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and
enclosed adult booths in sexually- oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex
between individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and
promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle
dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.



      (38)   Workers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of
unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and
businesses including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal
prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of Fla. Stat. Chapter 796,
operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage.



      (39)   Physical contact or touching between workers of
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and
customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of
communicable and sexually transmittable diseases.



      (40)   The practice of not paying or underpaying workers at
sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and
requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their
customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high
incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers.



      (41)   Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment
establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for
the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity
and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect
the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community.



      (42)   Requiring sexually-oriented businesses to post a
listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as
maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register
will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and
prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and
customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur.



      (43)   The general welfare, health, good order, morals and
safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this
chapter.



   (C)   Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and
preserve the good order, health, peace, morals, safety, and welfare of the
citizens of the City of Palm Bay.  This chapter regulates conduct and is not
an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by Fla. Stat. §
166.041.



   (D)   Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally
derived home rule power of the City of Palm Bay in the interest of the good
order, health, morals, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of
the city.



   (E)   Recitals. It is the City Council's further intention to
accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the City Council in the
recitals of the ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are
incorporated by reference into this section.



   (F)   Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This chapter is
intended to reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and
sexually-oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving
acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or
services involving matters which are sexual in nature.

§ 173.002  CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its
purpose of reasonably regulating sexually-oriented businesses and adult
entertainment establishments in order to reduce or eliminate adverse
secondary effects of such businesses and establishments.  See for example
and not by way of limitation Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111
S. Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed. 2d 504 (1991),  Cafe 207, Inc. v. St. Johns County,

County, 66 F. 3d 272 (11th Cir. 1995); cert. denied, 134 L Ed. 2d.647 (U.S.
April 22, 1996). This chapter shall not be construed to authorize any illegal
act under federal law, state law or city ordinance. This chapter is intended

adverse secondary effects of commercial establishments and businesses.  The
regulation of alcoholic beverage establishments is also addressed in the Code
of Ordinances the City of Palm Bay and other provisions of law.

§ 173.030  SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS.



   (A)   Challenge to suspension or revocation.  If the City Manager
or his or her designee notifies a licensee in writing of the pending
suspension or revocation of a license as provided in § 173.021, then the
suspension or revocation shall become final and effective fifteen (15) days
after mailing to the licensee's record address, posting at the licensed
establishment, or actual delivery of the notice to the licensee, unless
within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice of suspension or
revocation the licensee first files with the City Manager or his or her
designee a written response stating the reasons why the suspension or
revocation is alleged to be in error or inappropriate and a written notice of
intent to challenge the suspension or revocation requesting a hearing to
determine whether the suspension or revocation will become effective. The
suspension or revocation shall be abated in the event that a licensee files a
timely challenge to the suspension or revocation in accordance with the
procedures of this chapter or upon an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. A suspension or revocation already in effect, but not
previously challenged in a suspension or revocation hearing, may be
challenged in the same manner but is not abated during the proceedings.



   (B)   Hearing on suspension or revocation.  When a licensee files a
written response and notice of intent to challenge a pending or existing
suspension or revocation then a public hearing to determine if the pending
suspension or revocation will become effective and final shall be held by a
hearing officer appointed by the City Council. The City Manager or his or her
designee shall notify the City Attorney and any appropriate city officers who
shall schedule and provide notice of the hearing date and time.



      (1)   Appointment, term and compensation of hearing officer:



         (a)   Three (3) hearing officers shall be appointed by
the City Council, and they shall be attorneys duly licensed to practice law
in the state, who have practiced in the state for at least five (5) years.



         (b)   Hearing officers shall be subject to removal with
or without cause, by the City Council. Hearing officers shall not be
considered to be city employees, although they may receive compensation for
their services and also may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per
diem expenses as may be authorized.



         (c)   Because only attorneys may hold the position of
hearing officer, the City Council shall not be required to retain an attorney
to represent the hearing officer.



         (d)   It shall be unlawful for a hearing officer to act
as an agent or an attorney for a party involved in a determination under the
provisions of this section or to be otherwise involved with any matter
arising under this section which will come before the city during the term of
the hearing officer's appointment. Further, a hearing officer shall not
initiate or consider ex parte communications or other communications with any
party of interest to a hearing officer concerning the substance of any
proceeding to be heard by a hearing officer. However, the foregoing does not
prohibit discussions between the hearing officer and city staff that pertain
solely to scheduling and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits
of the application. If a person engages in an ex parte communication with the
hearing officer, the hearing officer shall place on the record of the pending
case all ex parte written communications received, all written responses to
such communications, a memorandum stating the substance of all oral
communications received, and all oral responses made, and shall advise all
parties that such matters have been placed on the record. Any party desiring
to rebut the ex parte communication shall be entitled to do so but only if
such party requests the opportunity for rebuttal within ten (10) days after
notice of such communication. If he or she deems it necessary due to the
effect of an ex parte communication received by him or her, the hearing
officer may withdraw from the case and the City Council shall appoint another
hearing officer to handle the case.



         (e)   Selection of hearing officer. The City Manager and
licensee shall each have the right to eliminate one (1) of the three (3)
hearing officers selected by the City Council. The one (1) hearing officer
not eliminated by either party shall act as the hearing officer for the
license revocation hearing. In the event licensee objects to all three (3)
hearing officers, then the City Council shall choose the hearing officer from
the list of three (3) hearing officers absent a showing of clear prejudice by
the licensee.



      (2)   The hearing officer shall have the power to:



         (a)   Adopt rules for the conduct of the hearing;



         (b)   Subpoena licensees and witnesses to its hearings.
Subpoenas may be served by the Police Department and/or other law enforcement
agencies with jurisdiction to serve subpoenas;



         (c)   Subpoena evidence to its hearings;



         (d)   Administer oaths and take testimony under oath; and



         (e)   Issue an order having the force of law suspending
or revoking the license.



      (3)   The suspension or revocation hearing shall be held
within thirty (30) days of the City Manager's receipt of a written challenge
and request for a hearing by the aggrieved licensee.



      (4)   The participants before the hearing officer shall be the
licensee, any witnesses of the licensee, the City Manager or his or her
designee and any witnesses of the City Manager or his or her designee. All
witnesses shall provide their legal name, mailing addresses and telephone
number.



      (5)   The procedures used shall be those typically used in a
civil case with the City Manager or his or her designee having the burden of
proof by clear and convincing evidence.



      (6)   Testimony and evidence may be submitted by any witness
but shall be limited to matters directly relating to the grounds for
suspension or revocation. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious
testimony or evidence shall be excluded.



      (7)   All testimony shall be under oath. The hearing officer
shall decide all questions of evidence, procedure and standing. All hearings
shall be open to the public. Minutes shall be kept at all hearings. Unless
otherwise mutually agreed to between the licensee and the City Manager or his
or her designee, the order of presentation of testimony and evidence shall be
as follows:



         (a)   The City Manager or his or her designee and any
witnesses of the City Manager or his or her designee.



         (b)   The licensee and any witnesses of the licensee.



         (c)   Rebuttal witnesses from the City Manager or his or
her designee.



         (d)   Rebuttal witnesses from the licensee.

designee.



         (f)   Summation by the licensee.



      (8)   The hearing officer may also call and question witnesses
or request additional evidence as the hearing officer deems necessary and
appropriate.



      (9)   The city shall provide a hearing room and clerical staff
as may be reasonably required by the hearing officer to conduct hearings and
perform his or her duties.



      (10)   Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call
and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses,
impeach witnesses and rebut evidence.



      (11)   The licensee has the right, at his or her own expense,
to be represented by an attorney at any hearing.



      (12)   All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under
oath and shall be recorded. The licensee or the city may cause a verbatim
record of the proceedings to be made.



      (13)   If the hearing officer comes to believe that any facts,
claims, or allegations necessitate additional review or response by either
the licensee or the City Manager or his or her designee, then the hearing
officer may order the hearing continued until an announced date certain, not
to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of continuance. The hearing officer
shall render a final decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days of the
City Manager's receipt of licensee's written notice of challenge.



      (14)   Hearing officers may allow the parties to submit
written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the
hearing and shall advise the parties of the timetable for so doing, if
allowed.



      (15)   At the conclusion of the hearing within the time
prescribed herein, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth
findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law
regarding whether the suspension or revocation will become or remain
effective, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief
consistent with powers granted in this section.



   (C)   Filing of decision. The original of the written decision of
the hearing officer shall be filed with the City Clerk and copies shall be
delivered or mailed to the licensee, the City Manager or his or her designee
and the Police Department.

request for a suspension or revocation hearing is filed within fifteen (15)
days of the notice of a pending suspension or revocation, or if the licensee
who requested the hearing does not appear at the suspension or revocation
hearing after notice, or if the hearing officer decides after a hearing that
a pending suspension or revocation will become final, then the City Manager
or his or her designee shall issue to the licensee notice of final suspension
or revocation of the adult entertainment license and mail or arrange delivery
of the notice to the licensee's record address.



   (G)   Effective date of suspension or revocation. The suspension or

secondary effects such as, but not limited to, prostitution, attempted rape,
rape,  assault, and the spread of sexually communicable diseases; that
actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct in public places, begets and
has the potential for begetting undesirable and unlawful behavior; that
sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct results in violation of law
and creates dangers to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public
and those who engage in such conduct; and, it is the intent of § 173.064 to
specifically prohibit nudity, gross sexuality and the simulation thereof.

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT



PART 1 - ADMINISTRATION



§ 174.001  TITLE.



   This ordinance shall be known as the “Floodplain Management”
ordinance, hereinafter referred to as “this ordinance.”



   (A)   Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all
development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area,
including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and
other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration,
remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or
demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the
Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of
manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of
tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools;
and any other development.



   (B)   Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and
flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to
establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding
through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:



      (1)   Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and
public service during times of flooding;



      (2)   Require the use of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize future flood damage;



      (3)   Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving,
excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other
development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;



      (4)   Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas,
watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the
natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain;



      (5)   Minimize damage to public and private facilities and
utilities;



      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood hazard areas;



      (7)   Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds
for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and



      (8)   Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program for community participation as set forth in the 44 C.F.R., § 59.22.



   (C)   Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is
intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida
Building Code.  Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard
that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 



   (D)   Warning.  The degree of flood protection required by this
ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is
considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and will
occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard
areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free
from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood
elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R., §§ 59 and 60 may be
revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community
to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or
future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance.



   (E)   Disclaimer of Liability.  This ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of City Council of the City of Palm Bay or by any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance
on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.



(Ord. 2014-04, passed 3-4-14)



 



§ 174.002  APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a
specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 



   (B)   Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall
apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Palm Bay, as established
in subsection (C) of this section.



   (C)   Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance
Study for Brevard County, Florida, and Incorporated Areas, dated March 17,
2014, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to
such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall
serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and
maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the City Hall Annex
Building, 120 Malabar Road SE, Palm Bay, Florida 32907.



   (D)   Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas.
To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to §
174.005 of this ordinance the Floodplain Administrator may require submission
of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida
licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the
community indicates that ground elevations:



      (1)   Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation,
even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the
area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements
of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida
Building Code. 



      (2)   Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation,
the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant
obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood
hazard area.



   (E)   Other laws.  The provisions of this ordinance shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law.



   (F)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes
any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas.
However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances
including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances,
stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code.  In the
event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such
interests shall also be governed by this ordinance.



   (G)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of
this ordinance, all provisions shall be:



      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;



      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.



(Ord. 2014-04, passed 3-4-14)



§ 174.003  DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.



   (A)   Designation. The Floodplain Administrator in the Growth
Management Department is designated to administer the floodplain management
program for the City of Palm Bay. The Floodplain Administrator may delegate
performance of certain duties to other employees.



   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator is authorized and directed to
administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The Floodplain
Administrator shall have the authority to render interpretations of this
ordinance consistent with the intent and purpose of this ordinance and may
establish policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its
provisions. Such interpretations, policies, and procedures shall not have the
effect of waiving requirements specifically provided in this ordinance
without the granting of a variance pursuant to § 174.007 of this ordinance.



   (C)   Applications and permits. The Floodplain Administrator, in
coordination with other pertinent offices of the community, shall:



      (1)   Review applications and plans to determine whether
proposed new development will be located in flood hazard areas;



      (2)   Review applications for modification of any existing
development in flood hazard areas for compliance with the requirements of
this ordinance;



      (3)   Interpret flood hazard area boundaries where such
interpretation is necessary to determine the exact location of boundaries; a
person contesting the determination shall have the opportunity to appeal the
interpretation;



      (4)   Provide available flood elevation and flood hazard
information;



      (5)   Determine whether additional flood hazard data shall be
obtained from other sources or shall be developed by an applicant;



      (6)   Review applications to determine whether proposed
development will be reasonably safe from flooding;



      (7)   Issue floodplain development permits or approvals for
development other than buildings and structures that are subject to the
Florida Building Code, including buildings, structures and facilities exempt
from the Florida Building Code, when compliance with this ordinance is
demonstrated, or disapprove the same in the event of noncompliance; and



      (8)   Coordinate with and provide comments to the Building
Official to assure that applications, plan reviews, and inspections for
buildings and structures in flood hazard areas comply with the applicable
provisions of this ordinance.



   (D)   Substantial improvement and substantial determinations. For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements,
repairs of substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such
buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with
the Building Official, shall:



      (1)   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to
obtain an appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent
appraiser, of the building or structure before the start of construction of
the proposed work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or
structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any
repairs are made;



      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to
repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs
of improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the
building or structure;



      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the
determination requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements

for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is
determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction
requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11
Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair,
improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building’s continued
designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the
proposed work precludes the building’s continued designation as a historic
building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair,
improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the
Florida Building Code.



   (F)   Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be
issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this ordinance,

      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed development,
including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current
and future owners;



      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
development to the community;



      (5)   The availability of alternate locations for the proposed
development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion;



      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed development with
existing and anticipated development;



      (7)   The relationship of the proposed development to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area;



      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of
flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      (9)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and



      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and
bridges.



   (H)   Conditions for issuance of variances.  Variances shall be
issued only upon:



      (1)   Submission by the applicant of a showing of good and
sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration,
or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this
ordinance or the required elevation standards;



      (2)   Determination by the City Council that:



         (a)   Failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that
render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or
inconvenience do not constitute hardship;



         (b)   The granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and



         (c)   The variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.



      (3)   Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the
variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the
Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land; and



      (4)   If the request is for a variance to allow construction
of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a
building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written
notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance,
specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed
elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation
increases risks to life and property.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION



PART 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 174.050  TITLE.



   This subchapter shall be known as “The Stormwater Management and
Conservation Ordinance.”



(Ord. 95-33, passed 8-24-95)



§ 174.051  FINDING OF FACTS.



   The City Council finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of
land may have a significantly adverse impact upon the quality of the waters
of the community, generally:



   (A)   Stormwater runoff carries pollutants into receiving water
bodies, degrading water quality;



   (B)   The increase in nutrients accelerates eutrophication of
receiving waters, adversely affecting fauna and flora;



   (C)   Improper channeling of water increases the velocity of runoff,
thereby increasing erosion;



   (D)   Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography
and removal of vegetation increases erosion;



   (E)   Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion
decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with
navigation and harms fauna and flora;



   (F)   Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of
stormwater runoff.  Less water percolates into the soil and recharge of
groundwaters is thereby decreased;



   (G)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff increases the incidence of
flooding and the level of floods which occur, possibly destroying property
and causing loss of life;



   (H)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff interferes with the maintenance
of optimum salinity in estuarine areas.



(Ord. 95-33, passed 8-24-95)



§ 174.052  OBJECTIVES.

   (I)   To protect, restore and maintain natural salinity levels in
estuarine areas;



   (J)   To minimize erosion and sedimentation;



   (K)   To prevent damage to and encourage protection of wetlands;



   (L)   To protect, restore, and maintain the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of groundwater and stormwater;



   (M)   To prevent damage from flooding, while recognizing the natural
fluctuations in water levels are beneficial;



   (N)   To protect, restore, and maintain the habitat of fish and
wildlife;



   (O)   To provide for stormwater infiltration, settling of suspended
solids and removal of pollutants from runoff prior to discharge into surface
waters;

§ 174.068  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   To ensure attainment of the objectives of this subchapter and that
performance standards will be met, the design, construction, and maintenance
of drainage systems shall be consistent with the following standards:



   (A)   Channeling stormwater runoff directly into water bodies shall
be prohibited. Instead, runoff should be routed over a longer distance,
through swales and other works designed to increase infiltration, allow
suspended solids to settle, and remove pollutants;



   (B)   Natural watercourses shall not be dredged, cleared of
vegetation, deepened, widened, straightened, stabilized or otherwise
altered.  Water shall be retained or detained before it enters any natural
watercourse in order to preserve the natural hydrodynamics of the watercourse
and to prevent siltation or other pollution;



   (C)   The area of land disturbed by development shall be as small as
practicable.  Those areas which are not to be disturbed shall be protected
by an adequate barrier from construction activity.  Whenever possible,
natural vegetation shall be retained and protected;



   (D)   No grading, cutting or filling shall be commenced until
erosion and sedimentation control structures have been installed between the
disturbed area and water bodies, watercourses and wetlands;



   (E)   Land which has been cleared for development and upon which
construction has not commenced shall be protected from erosion by appropriate
techniques designed to revegetate the area;



   (F)   Sediment shall be retained on the site of the development;



   (G)   Wetlands and other water bodies shall not be used as primary
sediment traps during development;



   (H)   Erosion and sedimentation facilities shall receive regular
maintenance to ensure that they continue to function properly;



   (I)   Artificial watercourses shall be designed, considering soil
type, so that the velocity of flow is low enough to prevent erosion;



   (J)   City and MTWCD maintained facilities are subject to the level
of service and standards the city and MTWCD respectively have the ability to
provide.



   (K)   Vegetated buffer strips shall be created or, where
practicable, retained in their natural state along the banks of all
watercourses, water bodies or wetlands.  The width of the buffer shall be
sufficient to prevent erosion, trap the sediment in overland runoff, provide
access to the water body and allow for periodic flooding without damage to
structures;



   (L)   Intermittent watercourses, such as swales, shall be vegetated;



   (M)   Retention and detention ponds shall be used to retain and
detain the increased and accelerated runoff which the development
generates.  Water shall be released from detention ponds into watercourses
or wetlands at a rate and in a manner approximating the natural flow which
would have occurred before development;



   (N)   Although the use of wetlands for storing and purifying water
is encouraged, care must be taken not to overload their capacity, thereby
harming the wetlands and transitional vegetation;



   (O)   Dry retention facilities, a volume sufficient to retain the
runoff from one-half (½) inch of rainfall of entire site (or one and
one-half (1½) inches of runoff of impervious surfaces if greater) shall be
provided;



   (P)   Wet detention facilities, no more than one-half (½) of this
volume may be discharged in the first seventy-two (72) hours following a
storm event; the total volume recovery occurring in fourteen (14) days;



   (Q)   Volume in the permanent pool (below maintained water level) in
wet detention facilities must be sufficient to provide a residence time of at
least fourteen (14) days.  This volume may be determined as one and one-half
(1½) inches over the impervious portion of the drainage basin, plus one-half
(½) inch over the pervious portion of the basis;



   (R)   The inlet structure and outlet structure in wet detention
facilities shall be located that contact between stormwater and littoral
plantings is maximized.  The inlet to the wet detention pond should be
baffled to reduce turbulence, and the outlet from the wet detention pond
shall be located as far as practicable from the inlet and should be
constructed with skimmers to prevent the transmission of oils, grease and
floating debris;



   (S)   Runoff from parking lots shall be treated to remove oil and
sediment before it enters receiving waters;



   (T)   Detention and retention areas shall be designed when possible
so that shorelines are sinuous rather than straight and so that the length of
shoreline is increased, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral
vegetation;



   (U)   The use of drainage facilities and vegetated buffer zones as
open space, recreation and conservation areas shall be encouraged;



   (V)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized and protected from erosion
as soon as possible.



   (W)   Retention areas shall be designed as dry- bottom ponds, with
the seasonal high groundwater table demonstrated to be at least one (1) foot
below the finished pond bottom.  Wet bottom ponds may be used provided that
the entity responsible for maintenance shall not be the city.



   (X)   Detention reservoirs may be designed as wet-bottom or
dry-bottom ponds.  If designed as dry- bottom ponds, the seasonal high
groundwater table shall be demonstrated to be at least one (1) foot below the
finished pond bottom.  If designed as a wet- bottomed pond, the depth shall
be sufficient to limit growth of emergent plants to designated peripheral
littoral zones, if applicable.  Detention ponds shall be designed to remain
hydraulically separate from the retention ponds so that backflow and mixing
does not occur.



   (Y)   Dry retention systems shall be designed to recover one-half
(½) of their volume in twenty-four (24) hours and the entire volume in
seventy-two (72) hours.  Wet detention systems shall recover their volumes
in less than fourteen (14) days.



   (Z)   The City Engineer may, under certain extenuating

practicable, be allocated in relationship to the respective runoff
contributions of individual parcels of land.



   (C)   Each user in the city has an obligation to pay for an
equitable share of the cost of the stormwater management system. The cost for
replacement and renewal of those portions of the stormwater system which no
longer function properly or which no longer meet regulatory requirements is
also a city-wide responsibility.



   (D)   It is necessary to establish methods for controlling the
introduction of pollutants into the City of Palm Bay's separate storm sewer
system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process as set forth in Chapter
95, to provide for public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of
the property owners and citizens of Palm Bay.



   (E)     It is necessary to establish methods for regulation,
funding, operating and maintaining regulatory mandates.  This includes, but
is not limited to, the federally-mandated National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) requirements; the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) permit which the city holds to operate an
MS4; city-wide water quality monitoring; federal, state and local mandates
(stormwater and water quality); public outreach and education efforts;
management of the waters of the Turkey Creek and Indian River Lagoon
(inclusive of dredging, water quality, pollution control, debris removal and
monitoring); the illicit Discharge Ordinance (Chapter 95, Ordinance No.
2008-37) which applies to all properties within the city limits; stormwater
infrastructure inventories and related stormwater management plan; grants
acquisition and management; the implementation of city-wide stormwater Best
Management Practices (BMP's); intergovernmental relations and regulations;
stormwater permitting, plan review, and local regulation; right-of-way and
driveway permitting; residential drainage permitting.  These programs are
designed to serve the greater good of all property owners, citizens,
stakeholders and visitors to our community including those in subdivisions
and similar developments both privately or publicly maintained.

tenant(s) of each parcel subject to the fee. Fees will be charged monthly but
may be collected at appropriate intervals. All owner(s) shall be mailed bills
or statements for the use of these services and facilities of the system by
the city. The bills or statements shall be payable on the due date stated on
the bill. If payment is not received within thirty (30) days after the due
date, the owner(s) of said property shall be notified by mail of the amount
due and the city's intent to impose a lien to cover the outstanding bill,
including interest at the maximum rate allowed by law on the payment due, and

   (B)   Delinquent Bills. If payment is not received within thirty
(30) days from the date of the notice to the owner(s) indicating the total
amount due, the City Manager shall impose a lien on the property in the
amount of the outstanding sums due. The lien may be recorded in the official
records of the county. Liens created under this section shall remain co-equal
with liens of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, superior in
dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid, and shall bear

   (A)   A property with functioning on-site stormwater drainage
facilities may receive a stormwater management system user fee credit.



      (1)   Retention Systems – eligible for a credit of up to one
hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the user fee confirmed by the
Director to be the percentage of stormwater runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour
storm event which is retained on the property (credit is directly
proportional to volume of runoff retained).



      (2)   Detention Systems – eligible for a credit of up to
fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the user fee confirmed by the Director
to be the ratio of parcel's runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour storm event with
the detention facilities as compared to without (credit is proportional to
the percentage of runoff rate reduction achieved).



      (3)   A property that does not contribute stormwater to the
utility and is not otherwise benefited by the utility shall be allowed a
credit of one hundred percent (100%).



      (4)   Property which is other than non-residential developed
property may be eligible for additional credits for the use and
implementation of the following one-time credits. These credits are
non-transferable, non-renewable, and cannot be issued more than one (1) time
per billed parcel.



         (a)   The installation and use of a city-approved
rain-barrel which is greater than thirty (30) gallons in capacity, free of
leaks, and non-metallic, will provide for a one-time credit of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) dollars to be applied against fees due; multiple discounts
for more than one barrel will not be provided.



         (b)   The installation and use of pervious pavement

exceed a maximum grade of three percent (3%), constructed of asphaltic
concrete, portland cement based concrete, recycled rubberized material, or
other materials capable of bearing vehicular traffic, that either replaces an
existing driveway or provides for the initial driveway installation, will
provide for a one-time credit of fifty dollars ($50.00) to be applied against
fees due.  Driveway permit fees as provided for in Chapter 179 for the
replacement of existing permitted driveways will be forgiven.  Any
proceeding resurfacing of the pervious materials will result in revocation
and forfeiture of the granted credit, will be charged in future fees, and
subject to driveway permit fees.



         (c)   Rain gardens constructed on the property that
retain a minimum of one (1) inch of the surface runoff from the roof shall
receive a credit of ten ($10.00) dollars for every twenty-five percent (25%)
of the roof runoff retained.  Credits shall be applied yearly upon

      (2)   Work commenced before acquiring permit. Where work for
which a sign permit is required commences prior to issuance of such the
permit, the fees for such permit shall be doubled, but the payment of such
double fee shall not relieve the sign permit applicant from fully complying
with the requirements of this Chapter and any other applicable regulations of
the City in the execution of the work nor from any other applicable
penalties. This provision shall not apply to emergency repairs under
subsection (B) above.

§ 178.18  CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN, AND LOCATION OF SIGNS.



   (A)   Design and construction. The design, construction and erection
of all signs permitted within the city shall conform to the requirements of
the Standard Building Code, adopted in Chapter 170 of this Code of
Ordinances. Signs containing components to be connected to an electrical
energy source shall also conform to the requirements of the National
Electrical Code, adopted Chapter 170 of this Code of Ordinances.  If the
requirements of this Chapter conflict with the requirements of the above
codes, the provisions of this Chapter shall govern.



   (B)   Illuminated signs.  All such light sources shall be
maintained in good working condition.  Signs which are not effectively
shielded to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at any portion
of the traveled ways in the City of Palm Bay and which are of such intensity
or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the vision of a driver of a
motor vehicle or which otherwise obscure or interfere with a driver's
operation of a motor vehicle are prohibited.



   (C)   Sign setbacks. Sign setbacks shall be determined to be the
leading edge of the sign or the supporting structure for such sign, whichever
is closer to the point from which the setback is calculated.



   (D)   Orientation. All signs shall be designed and erected to be
perpendicular to the ground upon which the sign is erected.



(Ord. 2017-39, passed 6-15-2017)



§ 178.19  MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS.



   (A)   Except as expressly otherwise provided, all signs regulated by
this Chapter, including their supports, braces, guys, anchors, electrical
parts, lighting fixtures, and all painted and display areas shall be
maintained so as to present a neat, clean appearance. Painted areas and sign
surfaces shall be kept in good condition, and illumination, if provided,
shall be maintained in safe and good working order.



   (B)   Weeds and grass shall be kept cut in front of, behind,
underneath and around the base of ground signs for a distance of ten (10)
feet, and no rubbish or debris shall be permitted under or near such signs.



(Ord. 2017-39, passed 6-15-2017)



§ 178.20  EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED SIGNS, NUISANCE.



   (A)   The following types of signs, in any location, are expressly
prohibited:

      (10)   Snipe Signs;



      (11)   Any sign confusingly similar to a Government Sign;



      (12)   Any sign, other than a Government Sign, in or upon any
river, bay, lake, or other body of water within the City;



      (13)   Any sign, other than a Government Sign, upon any pier
or seawall;



      (14)   Window signs which, in aggregate, cover more than
twenty-five (25) percent of the total window surface; and



      (15)   Any sign which:



         (a)   contains content previously adjudged obscene in
the community;



         (b)   emits audible sound, vapor, smoke, odor particles,
or gaseous matter;



         (c)   obstructs, conceals, hides, or obscures any
Government Sign;



         (d)   presents a hazard to the safety of the public; or



         (e)   causes radio, television or other communication
interference.



   (B)   Any sign expressly prohibited by this section shall be deemed
a nuisance. The Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall issue
notices to both the owner of the property on which such sign is located and,
to the extent discernable, those persons maintaining and/or owning such
signs, giving such persons ten (10) days to dismantle and remove signs or
take action to make such sign conform to the requirements of this Chapter.

removed immediately by direction of the Administrator, the Administrator's
designee, or any other City official responsible for public safety. 



(Ord. 2017-39, passed 6-15-2017)



§ 178.21  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.



   (A)   Any sign which did not conform to the provisions of Chapter
178 immediately prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and was not
legally permitted and constructed, shall be an illegal nonconforming sign and
shall be removed immediately.



   (B)   Unless otherwise subject to the provisions of § 70.20,
Florida Statutes, any sign which was legally permitted and constructed, but
which does not conform to the provisions of Chapter 178, shall be a legal
nonconforming sign and shall be governed as provided for herein.



   (C)   A legal nonconforming sign may not be altered, enlarged, or
moved in a way which increases its degree of nonconformity, but any sign or
portion thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity,
except as provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing or section (D)
below, a legal nonconforming sign may be reconstructed as a Digital Billboard
if doing so would otherwise conform to the requirements of Chapter 178.



   (D)   A legal nonconforming sign shall not be structurally altered
to prolong the life of the sign, except as otherwise provided herein.
Reasonable repair and maintenance of nonconforming signs, including change of
copy, is permitted, as provided for herein. Reasonable repair and maintenance
means the work necessary to keep the sign, including the sign structure, in a
good state of repair, but does not include replacement of materials in the
sign structure. Reasonable repair does not include:



      (1)   Any modification that changes the structure, or type of
structure, such as conversion of a wooden sign structure to a metal sign
structure;



      (2)   Any modification that increases the sign area or the
height above ground level.  Embellishments may be added provided they do not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the sign area, as established in Fla. Admin. Code
§ 14-10.007; or



      (3)   Any modification that adds lighting to a sign structure
that previously did not contain lighting and does not have the approvals to
do so, or changes the existing lighting from printed faces to digital faces
without prior approval. 



   (E)   Should a legal nonconforming sign become damaged, destroyed or
deteriorated by any means to the extent that it requires more than reasonable
repair and maintenance, as defined in subsection (D) above, then the sign
shall not be reconstructed except in compliance with this Chapter.



   (F)   Should a legal nonconforming sign be moved for any reason, it
shall thereafter conform to the requirements of this Chapter after it is
moved.



   (G)   A legal nonconforming sign, other than legal nonconforming
billboard signs, shall be deemed an abandoned sign and shall be removed if
either the sign or the sign structure has not been used, or if the parcel or
parcels upon which the sign is located becomes vacant or unoccupied for a
period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or more.



   (H)   A legal nonconforming billboard sign shall be deemed an
abandoned sign and shall be removed if either the sign or the sign structure
has not been used or becomes vacant or unoccupied for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive calendar months or more.



(Ord. 2017-39, passed 6-15-2017)



§ 178.22  PENALTIES.



   (A)   Litter along the streets and highways, including the State
highway system, public spaces, public rights-of-ways, and waterways of Palm
Bay, detracts from the beauty of the city. The term "litter" shall be as
defined in Florida Statute 403.413(2)(f), that is located on public property,
and shall include any artificial or manmade object illegally placed within a
public right-of-way or illegally nailed, fastened or affixed to any tree,
public utility pole, or other object located on public property or within a
public right-of-way. The terms "litter" shall include "snipe sign" as defined
within this Chapter.



   (B)   The placement of a snipe sign on public property is transient
in nature and is therefore irreparable. The existence of snipe signs are a
nuisance upon the city and its staff. The adoption of the prohibition
directed to snipe signs on public property shall be deemed notice of the
violation.  The person or business in possession or control of the snipe
sign and the person or business who owns or is advertised or identified by
name, address, website or other contact information on the sign may be cited
upon observation of the violation. The person or business who owns or is
advertised or identified on the sign shall be presumed to have permitted the
placement of the snipe sign in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The
term "transient in nature" shall mean that a condition exists on a temporary,
periodic, or non-permanent basis. The term "irreparable" shall mean the
condition is incapable of being remedied, as the harm sought to be prevented
has already occurred.



   (C)   Violations of this Section shall be unlawful and shall be
subject to the fines set forth in this subsection. Each piece of litter or
separate sign that a person illegally places on or affixes to public property
in violation of this Section shall be deemed a separate violation. The
schedule for fines for the violations shall be as follows:



 


Offense

 

Fine




1st

 

$50




2nd

 

$100




3rd and each thereafter

 

$150




 



   (D)   Any litter or snipe sign placed on or affixed to public
property or placed in the road right-of-way, including but not limited to
public property and rights-of-way along or adjoining any roadway, in
violation of this Section is hereby declared to be abandoned property and is
thereby subject to being removed by an employee of the Code Compliance
Division or a member of the Volunteer Citizens on Patrol (V-COP).



   (E)   The Division Manager of the Palm Bay Code Compliance Division,
or his or her designee, shall have the duty to enforce this subsection
(178.22) through such assigned personnel as the Manager or designee
determines to be appropriate.



   (F)   A violation of the snipe sign prohibitions of this Section
shall be documented by a digital photograph taken by a Code Compliance
Officer or V-COP.



   (G)   The Code Enforcement Board shall hear charges of code
violations pursuant to the issuance of citations. The Board shall operate in
the manner established in Chapter 52 of the Palm Bay Code of Ordinances.



§ 178.23  CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS; UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OR INVALIDITY.



   (A)   If any portion, clause, phrase, sentence or classification of
this Chapter, now or later amended, conflicts with any federal or state
statute or regulation, either now existing or later enacted, such conflicting
federal or state statute or regulation shall govern and the remaining
provisions of this Chapter that can be given effect without the conflicting
provision shall continue in full force.



   (B)   If any portion, clause, phrase, sentence or classification of
this Chapter, now or later amended or its application to any person or
circumstance, is held or declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
either unconstitutional, invalid, inapplicable, inoperative or void, then
such declaration shall not be construed to affect other portions of this
Chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application.  It is the express intention and opinion of the City Council of
the City of Palm Bay that any such unconstitutional, invalid, inapplicable,
inoperative or void portion or portions of this ordinance did not induce its
passage, and that without the inclusion of any such portion or portions of
this ordinance, the City Council would have enacted the valid constitutional
portions thereof.

§ 179.061  UNIFORM NUMBERING SYSTEM.



   A uniform system of numbering properties and principal buildings, as
shown on the map identified by the title “Property Numbering Map(s),”
which is filed in the office of the City Planner, is adopted for use in the
city. This map and all explanatory matter thereon is adopted and made a part
of this subchapter.



('74 Code, § 20-61)  (Ord. 84-16, passed 4-19-84)



§ 179.062  ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBERS.



   (A)   All properties, parcels of land, and principal buildings
within the corporate limits of the city shall hereafter be identified by
reference to the uniform numbering system adopted herein, provided all
existing numbers of property and buildings not now in conformity with
provisions of this subchapter shall be changed to conform to the system
herein adopted on June 1, 1984.



   (B)   A separate number shall be assigned for each parcel or
principal building regardless of whether mail is delivered to such parcel or
building. Only officially named public and private streets approved according
to § 179.066 shall be used for the assignment of numbers.



   (C)   Numerals indicating the official numbers for each principal
building or each front entrance to such building shall be posted. in such a
manner as to be clearly visible and distinguishable from the street on which
the property is located. Such numerals shall be a minimum of three (3) inches
in height and one-half (½) inch in width and of a contrasting color with the
building. Principal buildings obtaining permit approval after the effective
date of this subchapter shall post the address numerals before issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.



   (D)   Multiple-family units (including apartments, condominiums and
townhouse dwellings) that access onto named private drives or public road
rights-of-way shall be assigned four (4) digit numbers in which the first two
(2) digits refer to the building number and the appropriate grid range, the
third digit refers to the floor number, and the fourth digit, where feasible,
indicates the side — north, south, east or west — of the street the unit
is located. Odd numbers are assigned to the north and east sides of a street
or drive and even numbers are assigned to the south and west sides. The first
two (2) digits may also be assigned on the odd/even scheme just described. If
it is foreseen that a possible duplication of numbers may occur on road
rights-of-way where other structures can exist, one (1) number based on the
appropriate grid range shall be assigned to each building. Each unit will
then be assigned a three (3) digit number in which the first digit will
indicate which floor the unit is located (e.g., 101, 201, 301).



   (E)   Commercial and industrial buildings containing more than one
(1) occupant shall be assigned one (1) number based on the appropriate grid
range and the individual units shall be numbered consecutively in a logical
fashion. Structures containing one (1) occupant shall be assigned one (1)
number based on the appropriate grid range.

   (C)   The City Planner or his designee shall assign to any property
owner in the city or its immediate environs, upon request and without charge,
a property number according to the provisions of this subchapter. Provided,
however, that the City Planner may issue additional property numbers in
accord with the designated grid system whenever a property has been
subdivided, a new front entrance opened, or undue hardship has been induced
on any property owner.



   (D)   Should an existing building have, exhibit or be addressed
which does not conform with the uniform numbering system adopted herein, the
City Planner or his designee shall give notice to those owners or occupants
whose building number is in conflict with the uniform numbering system.  The
notice shall be delivered to the owner and occupant by regular U.S. mail,
posting same in a conspicuous place on the building or property, or by hand
delivery. The notice shall include a notification of a change of address
which shall contain the new building or property number(s) assigned to the
building or property in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and
shall direct the owner or the occupant to post the newly assigned building or
property number on the building or property in accordance with the provisions
of this subchapter.

§ 179.064  ANNEXATION.



   Whenever a parcel of land, a subdivision, or any part thereof, becomes
a part of the incorporated area of the city by annexation or otherwise, it
should be the responsibility of the City Planner or his designee to review
the building (i.e., address) numbers of such property and determine whether
such numbers for such annexed portion conform to the designated uniform
numbering system established by this subchapter. If the number, posting, or
method of numbering do not conform with the city's uniform numbering system,
the City Planner or his designee shall give notice of such nonconformance to
the owners or occupants of the affected building or property. Nonconformance
includes, but is not limited to, a number out of sequence, odd or even number
on the wrong side of the street and rural box numbers. The notice shall be
delivered in accordance with and contain the information and directions in
the provisions of § 179.063.

new application.



      (2)   The fees as set forth in this section shall be increased
by four percent (4%) (rounded to the nearest dollar) each fiscal year. 
Should any decrease in such fees be warranted in any given year, they shall
also be decreased annually by that percentage that accurately reflects the
reduction of permits requested and the specific and ascertainable resulting
reduction in funds needed to pay the city costs to manage all services and
time needed to issue and monitor the permits required by this section.



   (E)   Bond.  A performance bond, or other financial security
approved by the City Attorney, may be required in the case where the

specified work within thirty (30) days.  If the work in question exceeds a
value of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), the bond amount shall be increased
by the difference plus ten percent (10%).  If said work is incomplete after
thirty (30) days the bond will be forfeited.  All such bonds or other
security arrangements shall be on forms approved by the City Attorney.  Such
forms shall prescribe the manner in which noncompliance with the provisions
of a permit or this subchapter shall be remedied, and shall provide the
necessary financial assurances to remedy any non-compliance.

city the sum of money determined by the Public Works Department to be
necessary to restore the damaged area to its condition prior to the damage. 
Any such restoration shall meet all construction and engineering standards of
the city.  Additionally, any permittee who has previously failed to restore
the damage(s) as required by this subchapter shall not be issued further

the city to make such restorations has been paid in full by the applicant. 
In the event discrepancies arise as to the responsibility for damage, the
burden of proof shall be on the person or permittee to establish that the
person or permittee is not responsible.

§ 179.091  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   AASHTO.  The American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials.



   APPLICANT.  Any person that is applying for a right-of-way use and
easement permit.



   ARTERIAL ROAD ROW.  The primary function of arterial corridors is to
move moderate to large volumes of traffic relatively long distances.
Arterials often connect widely separated rural and urban communities.
Requirements for speed and level of service are usually quite high. Access
should be well controlled, and where possible, limited to other arterials and
collector roads. Arterials are used to move traffic around neighborhoods, and
should form a continuous network designed for a free flow of through traffic.



   ASTM.  The American Society for Testing and Materials.



   AS-BUILT.  Site plans, other descriptions and drawings that are
produced after the permitted improvement has been installed, placed, replaced
or constructed and is detailing the improvements exact location within a
right-of-way or easement. For further details, refer to § 179.096(E).



   BUSINESS DAY.  Every day except Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays of
the city, the state, and/or the United States of America.



   CITY.  The city, the City Manager or his designees.



   COLLECTOR ROADS.  The connecting link between local streets and
arterials to provide intra-neighborhood access. Traffic characteristics
generally consist of relatively short trip lengths, moderate speeds and
volumes. Access is of secondary significance, and should be limited to local
streets, other collectors and major traffic generators. Collectors should
penetrate neighborhoods without forming a continuous network, thus
discouraging through traffic which is better served by arterials.



   DAMAGE.  Any displacement, disturbance, or destruction, that injures,
breaks, impairs or causes harm in any way to city property or other
improvements that shall require repair or replacement to create a condition
equal to or greater than the condition prior to the occurrence of the damage.



   DER.  The Department of Environmental Regulation.



   DESIGN PLAN.  Site plans, related descriptions and drawings that are
produced before an improvement is installed, placed, replaced or constructed
within a right-of-way or easement. For further details refer to § 179.096(D).



   DEVELOPED AREA.  An area maintained and occupied by a commercial or
private entity.



   EASEMENT.  An interest in land granted, conveyed, dedicated, acquired
for or devoted to ingress and egress of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.



   EMERGENCY.  Any condition constituting an imminent or existing danger
to life or property caused by nature, accident or wear and tear that results
in an interruption of any public service, i.e., electrical,
telecommunications, water, sewer, and the like, or that impedes the use of
roads, streets, or other public rights-of-way and easements.



   EXCAVATION or EXCAVATE.  Any operation in which earth, rock, or other
material in the ground is moved, removed, or otherwise displaced by means of
any tools, equipment, or explosives, and includes, without limitation,
grading, trenching, digging, ditching, dredging, drilling, driving in,
auguring, tunneling, scraping, tree and root removal, cable or pipe plowing,
pile driving, wrecking, razing, moving, or removing any improvement or mass
of material, but does not include the tilling of the soil for agricultural
purposes.



   FDOT.  The Florida Department of Transportation.



   FRANCHISE.  An initial authorization, or contracts, or renewal thereof

§ 179.097  DESIGN, MATERIAL, TESTING AND REPORTS.



   The purpose of this section is to specify the limits on open pavement
cuts, to describe the improvement location zones within the right-of-way, to
detail the improvement's minimum clearance and coverage requirements and also
to specify accepted materials and testing methods to be used within the
rights-of-way and easements.



   (A)   Design requirements.



      (1)   Location.  Improvements shall be located as determined
by divisions (a), (b), (c) and (d) below. In all cases, dimensions are to be
referenced from the right-of-way line. The permittee may use additional
references at his own discretion.



         (a)   Electric, telecommunications, and CATV cable plant
improvements.  Permittees may, at their own discretion but within the limits
of this subchapter, locate electric, telecommunications and CATV cable plant
improvements underground or aerial. The city encourages the use of rear and
side property line utility easements and arterial and collector road
rights-of-way for all aerial improvements. When aerial improvements are
permitted within a road right-of-way, only one (1) side of the road
right-of-way will be reserved for aerial improvements. Improvements may be
allowed on the opposite side of the road right-of-way when the location is
required. Where feasible and practical, street lights should be attached to
existing poles that otherwise meet the city's criteria, thereby eliminating
additional poles.  Additional locational criteria for electric,
telecommunications, and CATV improvements are provided in division (d).



         (b)   All aerial improvements shall be located in a zone
between zero (0) and two (2) feet inside the road right-of-way line, except
in cases where the concrete pole base exceeds two (2) feet in width. The
additional size shall be accommodated if sufficient space is available. All
underground improvements shall be located in a zone between zero and six (6)
feet inside the road right-of-way line.



         (c)   Water, sewer and natural gas.  All water, sewer
and natural gas improvements located within a road right-of-way shall be
installed underground. The location shall be in a zone between six (6) feet
and ten (10) feet inside the right-of-way line.



         (d)   In cases where conflicts exist that would prevent
the location of proposed underground improvements in the location zones
provided for in divisions (a), (b), and (c) above, the following shall
apply:  If sufficient right-of-way width exists to provide for the proposed
underground improvements to be located outside of the dedicated zones and
excavation will not be required within five (5) feet of the edge-of-pavement,
the proposed location shall be considered for approval.  The final decision
shall, in all cases be that of the Public Works Department and shall be
binding on the permittee.



      (2)   Clearance.  The minimum clearance requirements for
installation of improvements shall be as follows:



         (a)   Aerial improvements shall have a minimum clearance
of eighteen (18) feet above the road surface. Other governmental agencies or
codes may require a greater clearance for certain applications.  Such
greater clearance requirements shall prevail. Traffic signalization
improvements shall be exempt from the minimum eighteen (18) foot clearance
but shall require separate approval from the City Engineer.



         (b)   Underground improvements shall be a minimum of
thirty (30) inches below the existing grade. Any crossing or parallel
installations of improvements to include storm drain culverts shall have a
minimum separation of twelve (12) inches. Manhole tops, valve boxes and meter
boxes shall be located no higher than existing grade. Where the construction
specifications of any other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the
permittee are more stringent than those of the city's, the more stringent
requirements shall govern.



   (B)   Material standards.



      (1)   Nonpaved areas.



         (a)   Back fill.  Backfill materials shall be of AASHTO

      (3)   Compaction.  When improvements can be installed in a
trench width of twelve (12) inches or less, and no deeper than forty-eight
(48) inches below existing grade, a compactive effort shall be required;
however no testing is required.



      (4)   Width.  When improvements are installed in trenches
with a width of greater than twelve (12) inches and/or greater than
forty-eight (48) inches below existing grade, the trench width shall be a
minimum of the diameter of the improvement plus twenty-four (24) inches; that
shall be twelve (12) inches on each side of the improvement. All compactive
efforts and testing shall be required as specified in § 179.097(B), (C), and
this division (4).



      (5)   Unsuitable material below improvement.  Wherever
excavation of the trench exposes unsuitable materials, as described in §
179.097(B)(1)(a), in the bottom of the trench and is an unsuitable foundation
upon which to lay or support the improvement, such unsuitable materials shall
be removed. The trench shall then be backfilled and compacted to a density of
ninety-five percent (95%) of AASHTO T-180-86, for each eight (8) inches of
suitable material to the bottom of the improvement. The placement of
three-fourths (3/4) inch rock gravel to the necessary depth may be used as an
alternative to the above method.



      (6)   Backfill.  Only good quality backfill, as provided for
in § 179.097(B)(1)(a), shall be used. All soft and yielding material and
other portions of the subgrade which will not compact readily shall be
removed and replaced with suitable material. Backfill shall be compacted in
two (2) stages. The first stage of compaction shall be up to a point of
one-half (½) the diameter of the improvement. The second stage of compaction
shall start at a point one (1) foot above the improvement and continue in
twelve (12) inch layers to the surface. Each layer's compaction effort from
one (1) foot above the improvement shall achieve a minimum of ninety-five
percent (95%) of maximum density in accordance with AASHTO T-180-86. Each
layer shall be compacted to the required density and tested as provided for
in this subchapter, prior to placing the next layer. Density tests shall be
accepted only on stabilized, nonyielding surfaces. Flowable fill may be used
as backfill. Flowable fill shall meet or exceed the minimum standards as set
forth in the Florida Department of Transportation 2000 Edition of Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Section 121-Flowable Fill,
Subsections 121-1 through 121-6, or the most current edition.



      (7)   Removal and use of excavated material. All excavated
soils from any project deemed suitable as fill material shall be utilized on
the permitted project or delivered to a city facility designated by the
public works department. All excavated soils deemed unsuitable shall be
disposed of by the permittee at its own expense and in a lawful manner. If it
is determined that the backfill material on site will not readily compact, it
may be exchanged on a one-for-one (1:1) basis with suitable material. Proper
records for this exchange shall be supplied to the city each day of the
exchange.



      (8)   Dewatering.  Construction shall be accomplished in a
dry trench. To maintain a dry trench, wellpointing or other approved methods
of dewatering shall be carried out. When dewatering is necessary, a plan
indicating the location and proposed system, i.e., length of points, size of
headers, and the like, to be used shall be submitted to the Public Works
Department for approval prior to installation. The proposal shall describe
the points of discharge along with proposed siltation protection. No
dewatering wellpoints shall be placed within five (5) feet of the edge of
pavement, except in the case of a permitted road cut. Restoration of
wellpointing holes and voids shall be accomplished by hydraulic backfilling
with clean sand and done in conjunction with the removal of the wellpoints.



      (9)   Trench box and sheeting.  A trench box or sheeting and
shoring shall be used to protect the work site, to include but not limited to
the preservation of the roads, adjacent property and improvements; also to
protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons on site. All trench
boxes, sheeting and shoring shall conform to current OSHA standards.

in § 179.097(B)(2)(a) shall be used. All soft and yielding material and
other portions of the subgrade which will not compact readily shall be
removed and replaced with suitable material. Compaction shall begin on the
first eight (8) inches of bedding backfill or on the exposed bottom to assure
the bedding is suitable as foundation to support the improvement, and
continue in twelve (12) inch layers to the bottom of the base material. Each
layer of the compaction effort shall achieve a minimum of ninety-eight
percent (98%) of maximum density in accordance with AASHTO T-180-86. Each
layer shall be compacted to the required density and tested as provided for
in this subchapter, prior to placing the next layer. Density tests shall be
accepted only on stabilized, nonyielding surfaces. Flowable fill may be used
as backfill. Flowable fill shall meet or exceed the minimum standards as set
forth in the Florida Department of Transportation 2000 Edition of Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Section 121-Flowable Fill,

compacted layers, below the asphalt surface course. The base backfill trench
shall be forty-eight (48) inches wider than the limits of the backfill
trench, twenty-four (24) inches on both sides. The compaction shall be in six
(6) inch maximum layers. Compacted density shall not be less than
ninety-eight percent (98%) of maximum density of a representative sample as
determined by AASHTO T-180-86. Each layer shall be compacted to the required
density and tested prior to placing the next layer. Density tests shall be
accepted on stabilized, nonyielding surfaces only. The public works
department shall reserve the right to substitute tests at random locations to
verify compaction.



      (5)   Prime coat.  The materials used shall be placed in
accordance with § 179.097(B)(2)(c)1. and 2.  In paved areas, application of
prime-coat shall be on all exposed surfaces and joints prior to asphaltic
concrete being placed; and the prime coat shall be applied at the rate of 0.1
– 0.15 gallons of emulsified asphalt per square yard and shall be applied
thoroughly and uniformly with no excess. In no case shall asphalt be placed
on any prime coat prior to that material's specified curing time.

OFF-PREMISES DIRECTIONAL/GUIDANCE SIGNS



§ 179.200  SCOPE.



   (A)   The standards for off-premises directional/guidance signs as
described herein shall apply to public roads located within the boundaries of
the city.  Off-premise directional/guidance sign placement is limited to
only those roads that meet the following classifications, described in the
city's Comprehensive Plan as:



      (1)   4-Lane Arterial, Divided;



      (2)    2-Lane Arterial;



      (3)    4-Lane Collector, Divided;



      (4)    2-Lane Collector, Divided;



      (5)    2-Lane Major Collector;



      (6)    2-Lane Minor Collector.



   (B)   The purpose of the off-premises directional/guidance sign is
to identify a destination and guide motorists to a specific area.  When
used, the off-premises directional/guidance signs should have the lowest
priority of all signs used in the public right-of-way or easement.  A
program of cooperation should be established between the city and other
governmental agencies when a sign is to be placed within any state or county
rights-of-way located within city boundaries.



(Ord. 2000-69, passed 12-21-00)



§ 179.201  CLASSIFICATIONS.



   The off-premises directional/guidance signs shall be divided into three
(3) classifications.



   (A)   Recreational and cultural (brown sign).  To provide
directions to structures and sites that include but  are  not  limited 
to:  parks,  libraries, sanctuaries, museums, etc.; areas of public
interests that are typically attractions and traffic generators because they
are open to the general public for the purpose of cultural, recreation, play,
amusement or relaxation used to refresh the body or mind or for the training

   (F)   In all cases, the exact location and number of off-premises
directional/guidance signs placed within the public road right-of-way shall
be determined by the Public Works Department of the city in accordance with
the standards set forth herein.



   (G)   The number of off-premises directional/guidance sign locations
will be limited and available locations will be permitted on a first
come-first serve basis.  Permit application will be accepted on file with
the city in chronological order to provide for rapid implementation in the
event a permit is canceled or expires and a specific location becomes
available.  The city will make every reasonable effort to provide the number
of signs and locations specified by the applicant up to the maximum
allowed.  In the event the city determines that it cannot totally comply
with the applicant's request, the city will offer to place signs that meet
the requirements and adjust the permit fees accordingly or, if possible,
locate the signs at the next-closest available location; applicant may,
during the permit application review phase, choose to continue the process or
withdraw the application.



   (H)   During the term of the permit, in-place signs may be relocated
or removed at any time should site conditions change and warrant such an
action by the city.  Any such modifications to the original permit
application are at the sole discretion of the Public Works Department and may
be accomplished with or without notice to the permittee, although every
effort will be made to contact the permittee should such a condition exist. 
No refund or adjustment to the original permit fee shall be made in any case.

      (1)   Permit application fee.  A non-refundable application
initial processing and design fee as established by resolution pursuant to §
169.004 shall be charged to the applicant and due in full at the time the
application is presented to the Public Works Department for review. 
Application fees are non-refundable if applications are rejected by the city,
canceled by the applicant, or for any reason an application becomes null and
void.  Applicants shall have sixty (60) days from the time the initial
permit application is received by the Public Works Department to either pay
for the approved permit in full or cancel the application. If no such action
is taken by the applicant within the provided sixty (60) day period, the
Off-Premises Directional/Guidance Sign Right-of-Way Use Permit application
shall become null and void.  Should any application become null and void,
any approved locations shall be available to the next qualified applicant.



      (2)   The permit fee structure for each sign blade up to the
maximum allowed shall be as established by resolution pursuant to § 169.004.

the following criteria:



   (A)   The permit application shall be processed within seven (7)
days, except that no tree removal permit shall be issued until the
owner/developer has applied for a building permit and all pertinent
subdivision and site plan reviews have been approved.



   (B)   The signing of the certificate of approval on a subdivision
plat and approved engineering drawings shall be considered as an issued
permit under the terms of this subchapter. This shall only allow that
clearing necessitated by the installation of the approved public
improvements. However, tree preservation measures may still be required for
exceptional specimens and trees within these areas after review in the field
by the Planning and Engineering Departments.



   (C)   Reasonable efforts shall be made on the property to save and
design around existing healthy trees. Preservation of exceptional specimen
trees may be required after review in the field by the Planning Director or
his designee. However, this shall not reasonably restrict the development of
a permitted use and shall not create an unsafe condition.



   (D)   Effort shall be made to preserve enough trees on site so as to
maintain the character of the existing tree coverage in the neighborhood
based upon the number, type, size and distribution of trees.



   (E)   Exceptional specimen trees approved to be removed shall be
replaced with trees of the same species or other species  as  approved by
the Planning Director.  Replacement trees shall have a two (2) inch caliper
and shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet overall height immediately after
planting.  One (1) replacement tree as described above shall be planted for
each six (6) inches of trunk diameter of those exceptional specimen trees
removed. In addition, all required trees as set forth in § 185.142, the
off-street parking area landscaping requirements, shall have a one (1) inch
caliper at planting.



   (F)   Efforts shall be made to preserve specimen trees and those
trees which are of significant historical, aesthetic, or ecological
importance to a site and/or the city.



   (G)   Efforts shall be made to preserve trees which are in required
landscape areas or yards.



   (H)   Efforts shall be made to select, design and locate permitted
signs so that they do not necessitate the removal of trees.

2-17-94)



§ 180.17  APPEALS.



   Any application for a tree-removal permit that has been denied may be
appealed pursuant to § 169.009 provided a written request is submitted to
the Growth Management Director. Such appeal shall follow the procedures set
forth therein.



('74 Code, § 22½-17)  (Ord. 89-12, passed 4-27-89)



§ 180.18  PROTECTION OF TREES TO BE PRESERVED.



   The property owner, developer, contractor, and/or  authorized 
agents  shall make every effort to protect those trees to be preserved
during site preparation and construction. To this end, the following methods
and procedures shall be followed:



   (A)   The use of hand labor may be necessary to clear vegetation
within the drip line of those trees to be preserved. This shall be determined
by the City Planner at the time of barricading as described below.



   (B)   Materials, machinery and soil shall not be placed within nor
use the area within the drip line of any tree to be preserved.



   (C)   Materials, wires, signs, or nails shall not be attached to any
tree unless such materials are used to preserve the tree.



   (D)   All felled material shall be promptly and carefully removed
from the site in order to avoid potential damage to remaining trees and
vegetation.



   (E)   Visible barricades shall be erected around those trees to be
preserved. These barricades shall be at the drip line of the tree(s) and no
closer than ten (10) feet to the trunk of the tree.



   (F)   All trees to be preserved, except palms, shall have their
natural soil level maintained. Tree wells and/or retaining walls shall be
provided where necessary to maintain the natural existing soil level. The
design of these structures shall be approved by the Planning Director and
shall generally be consistent with methods specified in Tree Protection
Manual for Builders and Developers, published by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Forestry, latest edition.



   (G)   All efforts shall be made through the grading and drainage
plan to maintain the natural drainage to those trees to be preserved. Swaling
and minor negative grade changes should always be designed outside the drip
line area as much as possible. Piping should be used where deep swales or
ditches would require significant grade changes adjacent to trees to be
saved. Trenching of any type should be avoided in the drip line area. Where
underground installations are required adjacent to the trunks of trees to be
preserved, tunneling should be used. When trenching or tunneling near trees
to remain, protective measures should be taken as specified in Tree
Protection Manual for Builders and Developers.



   (H)   All trees not approved for removal shall be protected and
maintained during construction, as specified in the Tree Protection Manual
for Builders and Developers or other comparable publications approved by the
Planning Division.

POTABLE WATER WELLFIELD PROTECTION CODE



§ 181.130  PURPOSE.



   The primary purpose of this subchapter is to reduce the risk to human
health associated with contaminated drinking water. The quantity and quality
of water available for use as a public water supply is directly related to
land activities. Presently, a majority of the city's residents obtain their
potable water supply from wells that pump water from a shallow aquifer. This
aquifer is recharged by rainfall that occurs in the area around the
wellfield. Land use activity near potable water wells has direct consequences
on the quality of water percolating into the surficial aquifer. To ensure the
long-term use of the present and future wells and wellfields it is necessary
to take steps which will help to prevent the contamination of underground
fresh water.

('74 Code, § 19½-22)  (Ord. 82-24, passed 7-1-82)



§ 182.03  REQUEST BY APPLICANT.



   (A)   Contents. Prior to any public improvement(s) being submitted
for acceptance for perpetual maintenance by the city, a written request must
first be submitted to the city. Such request must describe the type, location
and purpose of such improvement(s) to include, as applicable, the legal
description of the area to be served by the improvement(s), the detailed
operation of the improvement(s), and the public purpose served by the
improvements. Any acceptance of public improvements shall meet all
requirements contained in this Chapter with the exception of the following
public improvement types:



      (1)   Water, wastewater and reuse improvements may be accepted
administratively by the Utilities Department provided the conditions of
acceptance are contained within a written Service Agreement or other
contract. The Utilities Department has the right to not accept such
improvements administratively and may require that the applicant’s request
follow the procedures contained in this Chapter.



      (2)   Subdivision improvements, where the City Council has
agreed to accept identified public improvements during the Preliminary or
Final Subdivision process, may be accepted administratively provided the
applicant has constructed all improvements in conformance with approved
subdivision construction plans. The reviewing Departments have the right to
not accept such improvements administratively and may require that the
applicant’s request follow the procedures contained in this Chapter.



   (B)   Meeting of City Council. Such request shall be heard at a
regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council. The City Council, in its
determination of whether to accept such improvements, shall consider the
following:



      (1)   The public necessity and purpose of accepting the
improvement(s) to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public;



      (2)   The existing physical condition of the improvement(s);



      (3)   The extent to which the improvement(s) meets city or
site construction and design requirements or standards;

of development.



   (C)   Determination of need to accept improvement(s). Following
consideration of the above factors, the City Council shall make a
determination of the need to accept the improvement(s), whether the city has
the financial ability to maintain the improvement(s), the impact acceptance
of the improvement(s) will have upon other municipal services, the public
purpose to be served by accepting the improvement(s), the general capability
of the city to maintain the improvement(s), whether the health, safety, and
welfare of the general public will be



served by acceptance of the improvement(s), and its intent to accept the
improvement(s), or to accept the improvement(s) with conditions.



   (D)   Written request, accompanying documents.  Following a
determination of the City Council of its intent to accept the public
improvements(s) for maintenance, the applicant shall submit a written request
to the City Manager with two (2) copies and one (1) complete set of
“as-builts” which shall be reproducible. The request shall specifically
request consideration of the following items:



      (1)   Staff recommendations for approval of construction of
the public improvement(s);



      (2)   Release of the applicant from the performance bond or
surety for construction of the public improvement(s);

submitted to the city prior to the effective date of this section.



('74 Code, § 19½-23)  (Ord. 82-24, passed 7-1-82; Am. Ord. 89-16, passed
5-18-89; Am. Ord. 2012-49, passed 1-3-13; Am. Ord. 2016-31, passed 5-19-16)



§ 182.04  INITIAL CONSIDERATION.



   The city staff shall review, inspect and test the public improvements
at the applicant's expense. The type of tests shall be selected by the city,
shall be carried out by firms selected by the city and shall be carried out
in accordance with the standards, practices and procedures generally utilized
by the industry for such tests. Review of the public improvements by the city
staff is to be based upon the applicable city, county, state and/or industry
construction specifications that set the standards for the public improvement
contained in the request. The construction standards that will apply will
vary as follows:



   (A)   For public improvements that were constructed, placed, or
installed prior to July 1, 1982, the construction, placement or installation
shall be in accordance with the approved construction plans and the
applicable construction standards in effect at the time of construction. If,
however, review, inspection or testing yield results not in keeping with the
above, corrective measures shall be made in accordance with the approved
construction plans and the applicable construction standards in effect at the
time of construction by the developer.



   (B)   For public improvements to be constructed within the
subdivided plats that were recorded prior to July 1, 1982, but have not been
constructed, and for which construction plans have been prepared and
approved, the applicable construction standards will be the standard
construction specifications of the city and made a part of this chapter, by
reference, including, but not limited to, Divisions 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof as
those specifications exist today or as they may be amended from time to time
by the city engineer with the exception of those improvements where
construction has begun within two (2) years from July 1, 1982. In those
instances the construction standards shall be in accordance with the approved
construction plans and the applicable construction standards in effect at the
date of platting and plan approval. Upon the written request of a developer
for good cause, the City Manager may extend, for a maximum period of one (1)
year, the initial construction date for the applicable units under this
section. GOOD CAUSE, for purposes of this division (B), shall include the
inability to obtain or receive approval of necessary permits and approvals
from the regulatory agencies that regulate such construction.



   (C)   For public improvements to be constructed within subdivided
plats that were recorded prior to the effective date of this subchapter but
for which construction plans have not been approved, the applicable
construction standards will be the standard construction specifications of
the city adopted and made a part of this subchapter, by reference, including
but not limited to Divisions 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof as those specifications
exist today or as they may be amended from time to time by the City Engineer.



   (D)   For public improvements to be constructed under other than any
of the foregoing conditions, the applicable construction standards will be
the standard construction specifications of the city adopted and made a part
of this subchapter, by reference, including but not limited to Divisions 2,
3, 4 and 5 thereof as those specifications exist today or as they may be
amended from time to time by the City Engineer.



   (E)   In all of the foregoing cases, where modification of the
requirements of the city's current standard construction specifications is
being accepted, the modification is not intended to exempt compliance with
any and all other applicable existing provisions of this code of ordinances
and any other ordinance of the city.



   (F)   It is the express intent of the City Council to permit the
City Engineer, in his sound discretion, to amend specifications from time to
time in accordance with the standards as established by good engineering
practices and industry standards that pertain to the particular improvement
offered for acceptance by the developer.

not be accepted.



('74 Code, § 19½-25)  (Ord. 82-24, passed 7-1-82)



§ 182.06  REPORT TO COUNCIL.



   Upon completion of the review, inspection, testing and approval of the
public improvement, the City Manager shall report the findings to the City
Council. In no event shall the staff review process exceed sixty (60) days
unless testing of the public improvement cannot be completed within such time
period, in which event the time period shall be extended an additional sixty
(60) days.



('74 Code, § 19½-26)  (Ord. 82-24, passed 7-1-82)



§ 182.07  ACCEPTABLE IMPROVEMENTS.



   If the public improvement is determined to be acceptable, the City
Council may consider a resolution accepting the construction of the public
improvements specifically listed in the resolution, releasing the performance
bond as to those acceptable public improvements and requiring the applicant
to maintain the specified public improvements. Adoption of the resolution
shall be contingent upon the applicant posting a maintenance bond or adequate
security as determined by the Council, for the maintenance period prescribed
by the City Council. For those public improvements that were constructed
prior to July 1, 1982, the maintenance period will be for one (1) year; for
those public improvements constructed after July 1, 1982, the maintenance
period will be for two (2) years. The amount of the maintenance bond must be
approved by the City Council and the City Attorney as to the form. Such
resolution shall also be contingent upon the applicant complying with the
provisions of § 182.08. Such bond or security shall be filed with the City
Clerk.

§ 182.08  REVIEW FOR FINAL ACCEPTANCE FOR MAINTENANCE.



   (A)   Not less than ninety (90) days and not more than one hundred
and fifty (150) days prior to the expiration of the two (2) year maintenance
period, the applicant shall request the city to review, reinspect and retest
the public improvement, at the applicant's expense, for purposes of final
acceptance of the improvement for maintenance purposes.



      (1)   Such retesting shall be based upon standards, practices
and procedures that are generally utilized in the industry that pertain to
the public improvement sought to be accepted.



      (2)   If the public improvement is determined to be
acceptable, the City Council shall consider adoption of a final resolution
accepting the maintenance of the improvements specifically listed in the
resolution and establish the effective date as the termination of the two (2)
year maintenance period.



      (3)   If the public improvement is determined to be
unacceptable, the City Manager shall have the following options:



         (a)   Recommendation to the City Council that they
invoke the posted maintenance bond or security;



         (b)   Direction of the city staff to continue working
with the applicant on a correction list to complete the improvement at the
applicant's expense;



         (c)   Recommendation that the City Council take any
other action it may deem appropriate, including the rejection or tabling of
the request.



   (B)   In the event an applicant fails to either request review of
the applicable improvement or complete the required corrections under this
section within the appropriate time, such applicant will be required to post
and additional one (1) year maintenance bond or security. If the applicant
fails to post such a bond or security within thirty (30) days before
expiration of the existing bond or security, the City Council may rescind its
prior resolution accepting construction of the improvements, invoke the
posted maintenance bond or security, if appropriate, and the applicant shall
be required to recommence beginning with the requirements as established in
§ 182.03.



('74 Code, § 19½-28)  (Ord. 82-24, passed 7-1-82)



§ 182.09  NECESSITY OF COUNCIL ACTION  TO ASSUME MAINTENANCE
RESPONSIBILITY.



   Any resolution that provides for the city to finally assume
responsibility to maintain any public improvement shall not become final
until the expiration of any maintenance period required hereunder. The
maintenance of public improvements shall never become the responsibility of
the city unless and until final acceptance by the City Council by appropriate
resolution at the end of the two (2) year maintenance period.

   (H)   Interpretation of land use boundaries. Where uncertainty
exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the land use districts as
shown on the future land use map, the following rules shall apply:



      (1)   Where boundaries approximately follow streets, alleys,
or highways. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following the centerline or street line of streets, the centerline or alley
line of alleys, or the centerline or right-of-way line of highways such lines
shall be construed to be such district boundaries.



      (2)   Where boundaries parallel street lines, alley lines or
highway right-of-way lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that
they are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of
streets, the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerlines or
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed
as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the
zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the future land use map.



      (3)   Where boundaries approximately follow lot lines. Where
district boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such
lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.



      (4)   Where the boundary follows a railroad line. Where the
boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such boundary shall be deemed
to be located midway between the main tracks of the railroad lines.



      (5)   Where the boundary follows a body of water. Where the
boundary of a district follows a stream, lake or other body of water such
boundary line shall be construed to be the limit of the jurisdiction of the
city, unless otherwise indicated.



      (6)   Submerged areas not included in district. All areas
within the corporate limits of the city which are under water and are not
shown as included within any district shall be subject to all of the
regulations of the district which immediately adjoins the water area. If the
water area adjoins one (1) or more districts the boundaries of each district
shall be construed to extend into the water area in a straight line until
they meet the other district.



      (7)   Where property has not been included in district. In
every case where property has not been specifically included within a
district, or where territory has become a part of the city by annexation, the
same shall automatically be classed as lying and being in the single-family
land use district until such classifications shall have been changed by an
amendment to the future land use map as provided by law.



      (8)   Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street, alley, or
ether public way is vacated in the manner authorized by law, the land use
district adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all area included
in the vacation shall then henceforth by subject to all regulations of the
extended districts.



      (9)   Where district boundaries are indicated as following
platted lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the district
boundaries.



      (10)   Where district boundaries are indicated by specific
dimensions, such specific dimensions shall control.



      (11)   Where district boundaries divide platted lots or cross
unsubdivided property, and where no specific dimensions are indicated on the
future land use map, the scale of the future land use map shall control.



      (12)   Where the street or property layout or other physical
features existing on the ground are at variance with the future land use map,
or where other uncertainties exist as to interpretation of the future land
use map, the Planning Director shall interpret the map to fix the exact
location of land use boundaries.



   (I)   (1)   All development undertaken after the effective date
of this section shall be consistent with such plan, elements, and maps except
as provided herein.



      (2)   The Planning Director shall be the caretaker of and
responsible for recording all changes to the district boundaries on the
future land use map promptly after any amendment has been approved by the
City Council.



   (J)   Vested rights.



      (1)   In the event any provision of the comprehensive plan or
maps would limit or modify the vested rights of any person or entity to
complete any development that has been previously authorized, then in that
event, the city may recognize the right to complete the development as
provided herein. The city recognizes the right of any person to complete the
following development:



         (a)   Development that has received a building permit;



         (b)   Development that has received final plat approval
or final site plan approval;

approval, preliminary subdivision approval, or preliminary PUD approval
provided the development has secured a permit to construct all or any phase
of such development and is continuing the development in good faith.



      (2)   Any person or entity with vested rights who has a right
to complete a development and has secured a building permit, final plat
approval, final site plan approval, or preliminary approval as provided above
shall lose its right to complete such development if such development does
not maintain a current building permit, or current site plan or development
approval as provided for by this code of ordinances of the city. Once a
development has lost its current approval, then in that event future
development shall comply with applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan
and maps.



      (3)   The city may recognize other applications for vested
rights in accordance with the following procedure:



         (a)   Any property owner who claims to have vested
rights based upon a prior approval from the city other than as provided above
may submit to the city manager, within one hundred and twenty (120) days
after the effective date of this section, a written request for recognition
of the vested rights.



         (b)   The applicant shall submit such information as the
applicant deems appropriate to support a claim of vested rights including a
legal description of property, dates of any recent rezoning, preparation of
any plans, approval of any plans, any action of the city upon which applicant
has relied, facts showing substantial reliance or change in position.



         (c)   Within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
application, the City Council shall either recognize or reject the
applicant's claim of vested rights. If this city fails to act upon such
request within ninety (90) days, then the application shall be deemed to be
denied. No suit shall be filed by the applicant unless prior thereto the
applicant has made a request of the city prior to the litigation.



   (K)   Constitutional claims.



      (1)   In the event any person claims that any provision of the
comprehensive plan, elements, or maps constitutes a taking of the landowner's
property without due process of law and the payment of just compensation as
provided for in the Florida Constitution and the Constitution of the United
States of America, then in that event, the person shall first present the
claim to the city. The provisions of Fla. Stat. § 163.3215 shall prevail on
any claims that may be asserted under such statutes and this section shall
not be construed as an additional remedy presently governed by Fla. Stat. §
163.3215.



      (2)   Any person claiming such taking shall:



         (a)   Submit the claim in writing to the City Manager
identifying the name and address of the property owners;

economic deprivation;



         (g)   Case law or legal authority, if any, that
demonstrates the taking;



         (h)   Such other information demonstrating how the plan
or element constitutes a taking.



      (3)   After the city has received the request, it shall have
ninety (90) days to review and act upon the request. Due public notice as
required by Fla. Stat. Ch. 163 and Ch. 166, shall be provided prior to
granting any relief under this section. The city reserves its full
legislative function to act upon requests under this section and the actions
shall be presumed to be fairly debatable.

§ 183.20  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The concurrency management system shall implement established minimum
acceptable level of service standards for roads, potable water, sanitary
sewer, solid waste, drainage and parks. This system is designed to utilize
the most current and available data regarding the above public facilities or
services to measure the impact of any development permit proposal upon the
facilities for which levels of service have been adopted. No final
development permit can be issued unless adequate facilities or services are
available as determined by the concurrency evaluation.



('74 Code, § 18½-71)  (Ord. 89-09, passed 4-27-89)



§ 183.21  EVALUATION CRITERIA.

§ 183.22  CONCURRENCY EVALUATION FINDINGS.



   The city shall issue a concurrency evaluation during the building
permit process and this evaluation shall certify either a nondeficiency
finding or a deficiency finding:



   (A)   Nondeficiency finding. A finding of nondeficiency by the
concurrency evaluation shall remain valid provided a building permit has been
issued within sixty (60) days of the concurrency evaluation. Once a building
permit has been issued, the finding shall remain valid until construction has
been completed and a certificate of occupancy issued; or for the life of the
permit until it is revoked or suspended for failure to proceed in a timely
manner as prescribed.



   (B)   Deficiency finding.  A finding of deficiency by the
concurrency evaluation shall negate approval of the building permit
application or force deferral of this approval.

§ 183.34  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   A developer may choose to satisfy the transportation
concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair share
contribution, pursuant to the following requirements:



      (1)   The proposed development is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and applicable Land Development Regulations; and,



      (2)   The city five-year Community Investment Program (CIP)
includes a transportation capital improvement that, upon completion, will
accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development.



   (B)   The city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy
transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share
contribution by contributing to an improvement, that upon completion, will
accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development, but is
not contained in the five-year CIP, where one (1) of the following conditions
apply:



      (1)   The city adds the improvement to the five-year CIP no
later than the next regular capital improvements update of the Comprehensive
Plan, provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by
Fla. Stat. § 163.3180(16)(b)(1); or,



      (2)   If the funds in the five-year CIP are insufficient to
fully fund the construction of the improvement, the city may enter into a
proportionate fair share agreement with the developer authorizing
construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair
share amount is calculated if the proportionate fair share amount in such
agreement is sufficient to pay for one (1) or more improvements which will,
in the opinion of the City Council, significantly benefit the impacted
transportation system, provided that improvement(s) is(are) adopted into the
five-year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of
the Comprehensive Plan.

the applicable governmental entity for all other roads.



(Ord. 2006-128, passed 11-14-06)



§ 183.35  APPLICATION PROCESS.



   (A)   A developer who shall commence any land development activity
generating traffic that results in a failure of a road segment to achieve
transportation concurrency may apply to the city for a proportionate fair
share agreement.



   (B)   Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair
share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss
eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options
and other relevant issues.  If the road segment that has failed to achieve
transportation concurrency is on the Strategic Intermodal System, the Florida
Department of Transportation shall be requested to participate in the
pre-application meeting.



   (C)   Procedures for review of application for proportionate fair
share agreement.



      (1)   The developer shall submit an application to the Growth
Management Director that includes a non-refundable application fee of five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and the following:



         (a)   Name, address and contact information of the
developer;



         (b)   A drawing and legal description of the land;



         (c)   Phasing schedule;



         (d)   Description of the requested fair share mitigation;



         (e)   If the requested fair share mitigation involves a
road segment on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), evidence of
concurrence from the Florida Department of Transportation.



         (f)   Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic
engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to achieve transportation
concurrency.



      (2)   Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the application,
the Growth Management Director shall review the application to determine if
the application is complete.  If it is determined that the application is
not complete, the Growth Management Director shall send a written statement
to the developer delineating the deficiencies.  If such deficiencies are not
remedied by the developer within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written
notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned.  The Growth
Management Director shall grant an extension to cure such deficiencies,
provided the developer has shown good cause for the extension and has taken
reasonable steps to effect a cure.



      (3)   Once the Growth Management Director determines that the
application is complete, written notification shall be sent to the
developer.  The Growth Management Director shall also forward the
developer's application to the City Attorney who shall, within thirty (30)
days, draft a proportionate fair share agreement for consideration by the
City Council at a meeting no later than sixty (60) days from the date the
developer received the notification that the application was complete.



      (4)   No proportionate fair share agreement shall be effective
until approved by the City Council.



(Ord. 2006-128, passed 11-14-06)



§ 183.36  DETERMINATION OF PROPORTIONATE FAIR SHARE OBLIGATION.



   (A)   Proportionate fair share mitigation includes, without
limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land
and contribution of transportation facilities.



   (B)   The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate
fair share obligation shall be as provided in Fla. Stat. § 163.3180(12), and
as represented by the following formula:



Proportionate Share = [(Development Trips) / (SV Increase)] x Cost



Where:



Development Trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to
roadway segment;



SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the improvement to roadway
segment



Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement.



   (C)   For the purposes of determining proportionate fair share
obligations, capital improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of
the improvement as obtained from the CIP, the Brevard MPO Transportation
Improvement Program, or the Florida Department of Transportation Work
Program.  Where such information is not available, the improvement cost
shall be determined using one (1) of the following methods:



      (1)   An analysis by the Growth Management Department of
costs, adjusted by the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends
Indexfrom the previous year, by cross section type that incorporates data
from recent projects; or, 



      (2)   The most recent issue of Florida Department of
Transportation "Transportation Costs", as adjusted, based upon the type of
cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects
on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the
cost of materials due to unforeseeable events.



   (D)   If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by
the developer, then the value of the improvement shall be determined by using
one (1) of the methods provided in this section.



   (E)   If the city accepts any right-of-way dedication for the
proportionate fair share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site
related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at
one-hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the most recent assessed value of
the land, upon which the right-of-way is or will be located, by the Brevard
County Property Appraiser or, at the mutual agreement of the city and the
developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal
approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The developer shall
supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no
expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication
proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate
fair share obligation for that development, then the developer must also pay
the difference.



(Ord. 2006-128, passed 11-14-06)



§ 183.37  TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES IMPACT FEE CREDIT.



   (A)   Proportionate fair share mitigation shall be applied as a
credit against impact fees.  Credits will be given for that portion of the
impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the
proportionate fair share contribution is calculated.  Additionally, if the
proportionate fair share contribution is based on only a portion of the
development's traffic, the credit will be limited to that portion of the
impact fees on which the proportionate fair share contribution is based.



   (B)   At the time the proportionate fair share obligation is being
determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact
fee obligation for the proposed development.  If the developer's
proportionate fair share obligation is less than the development's
anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee, then the developer
must pay the difference to the city.



(Ord. 2006-128, passed 11-14-06)



§ 183.38  PROPORTIONATE FAIR SHARE AGREEMENTS.



   (A)   Should the developer fail to apply for a building permit
within one (1) year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair share
agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the
developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of
this section.



   (B)   Payment of the proportionate fair share contribution is due in
full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the
final plat and shall be nonrefundable.  If the payment is submitted more
than one (1) year from the date of execution of the agreement, then the
proportionate fair share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment
based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required
improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to the methodology set forth in
§ 183.36 and adjusted accordingly.



   (C)   Developer improvements authorized under this subchapter
involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of
the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond.  The form of the warranty
bond shall be approved by the City Attorney.



   (D)   Developer improvements authorized under this subchapter not
involving dedications to city must be completed upon recording of a final
plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever event first
occurs.



   (E)   Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a
development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair share
contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic.



   (F)   A developer may submit a letter to withdraw from the
proportionate fair share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the
agreement.  The application fee to the city will be nonrefundable.



(Ord. 2006-128, passed 11-14-06)



§ 183.39  APPROPRIATION OF FAIR SHARE REVENUES.



   (A)   All proportionate fair share revenues shall be placed in the
appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIP,
or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair
share agreement.



   (B)   In the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement
is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction
shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that
same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the
requirements of § 183.34(B)(2), as determined by the City Council.

development costs for the applicant.



(Ord. 96-05, passed 2-15-96; Am. Ord. 2016-32, passed 5-19-16)



§ 184.07  PRELIMINARY PLAT.



   (A)   Application procedure. After a preapplication conference has
been held, an applicant can submit an application for preliminary plat
approval. Such an application must be made on forms available from the City's
Land Development office. The application must be complete and accompanied by
two (2) copies of the preliminary plat as city described in these
regulations, a CD or other approved electronic copy of the plat, a filing
fee, and a list of all owners of adjacent property and/or property directly
opposite of the proposed subdivision. Such property owner information shall
be obtained from the most recent County Tax Appraiser's rolls.



   (B)   Application processing. The Land Development Division shall
process and coordinate the review of the preliminary plat application by the
appropriate city departments. The appropriate city departments are to review
and comment on the submitted information. Written comments from the city
departments are to be returned to the Land Development Division to be
incorporated into a staff report generated by the Land Development Division.
The staff report is submitted to the Planning and Zoning Board at the time of
the next regular meeting of the Board.



   (C)   Public meetings. The preliminary plat application shall be
heard by the Planning and Zoning Board at its regular meeting in the month
following the  submittal deadline date. Courtesy notice letters of the
meeting are to be sent to the owners of abutting and opposite properties of
the proposed subdivision. Failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice
shall not affect any action or proceedings taken however. Notice of such a
meeting shall also be posted on the property for which subdivision is sought.



   (D)   Preliminary approval.



      (1)   After the Planning and Zoning Board has reviewed the
preliminary plat, the city staff report with its recommendations, and
testimony and exhibits submitted at the public meeting, the Planning and
Zoning Board shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or
disapproval of the preliminary plat to the City Council.



      (2)   The City Council shall then approve, approve with
conditions, or disapprove the preliminary plat based on the Planning and
Zoning Board recommendations, the City staff report, and the testimony and
exhibits submitted at public hearings.



   (E)   Effective period of preliminary approval. The approval of a
preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year at the end of
which time final approval on the subdivision must have been obtained from the
City Council, although the plat need not yet be signed and filed with the
County Clerk of Records. Any plat not receiving final approval within the
period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and the developer
shall be required to resubmit a new plat for preliminary approval subject to
all new zoning and subdivision regulations.



   (F)   Zoning regulations. Every plat shall conform to existing
zoning regulations and subdivision regulations applicable at the time of

approval shall be exempt from any subsequent amendments to the zoning
ordinance rendering the plat nonconforming as to bulk or use, provided that
the final approval is obtained within the one-year period.



   (G)   Effect of approval of preliminary plat. Approval of the
preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. It shall
only be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the
preliminary plat as a guide for the preparation of the final plat.

§ 184.08  FINAL SUBDIVISION PLAT.



   (A)   Application procedure. Following the approval of the
preliminary plat, the applicant if he/she wishes to proceed with the
subdivision, shall submit an application for final plat approval to the Land
Development office. Such an application must be made on forms available from

application must be complete and accompanied by two (2) copies of the final
plat and construction plans as described in these regulations, a CD or other
approved electronic copy of the plat, a filing fee, and a list of all owners
of adjacent property and/or property directly opposite of the proposed
subdivision. Such property owner information shall be obtained from the most
recent County Tax Appraiser's rolls.



   (B)   Final plat to conform to preliminary plat. The final plat
shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and if
desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which he/she proposes to record and develop at the
time, if such portion conforms to the requirements of this chapter.



   (C)   Application processing. The processing of the final plat
application will be substantially the same as the processing of the
preliminary plat application described previously in § 184.07.

subdivision. Failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice shall not affect
any action or proceedings taken however. Notice of such a meeting shall also
be posted on the property for which subdivision is sought.



   (E)   Final approval. After the Planning and Zoning Board has
reviewed the final plat and construction plans, the city staff report with

§ 184.10  CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL.



   (A)   Commencement of construction prior to approval of plat. No
construction of any kind shall be permitted prior to final subdivision
approval by the City Council.



   (B)   Construction authorization. Prior to beginning any

§ 184.11  IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE BONDS.



   (A)   Performance bond. As a condition for approval of a final plat
by the City Council, the subdivider may be required to deposit with the City
Clerk a bond or other security binding the subdivider to payment to the city
to assure completion of all streets, drainage and other public improvements
both on site and off site as may be required. The bond or other security will
be in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of value of all
Public Improvements. The City Council may conditionally approve the final
plat to become effective at such time as the required bond or other security
shall be deposited with the City Clerk within a time fixed by the City
Council. The bond shall be executed by the subdivider as principal and may
have at least one (1) good and sufficient surety approved by the city. It is
the purpose and intent of this section that the subdivider provide such
security as the city shall deem to be reasonably necessary to assure
completion. The requirement of a surety on the bond shall be at the
discretion of the City Council; however, before the City Council accepts a
bond or other security, it must first obtain approval from the City Engineer
as to the amount and approval from the City Attorney as to the form of the
bond or other security.



   (B)   Completion of improvements. If a performance bond is not
required, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with
the City Councils' decision and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer all
public improvements and lot improvements of the subdivision as required in
these regulations and to dedicate the same to the city free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances on the property prior to city officials signing the
plat. The City may allow incremental drawdown of the performance bond as
improvements are made.



   (C)   Temporary improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for
all costs of temporary improvements required by the city and shall maintain
the same for the period specified by the city. Prior to construction of any
temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the local
government a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond
shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained and removed.



   (D)   Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made
by the applicants at his/her expense, without reimbursement by the city.



   (E)   Failure to complete improvement. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed
within the period specified by the City Council at the time of final plat
approval, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases when a
performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such performance bond, the City Council may
declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be
installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time
the bond is declared to be in default.



   (F)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers
of dedication of public improvements (such  as streets, public areas, parks,
etc.) shall be in accordance with the procedure and process established in
Chapter 182, procedure for acceptance and maintenance of public improvements.



   (G)   Maintenance Bonds. After completion of improvements and
exception of dedication, a two (2) year maintenance bond or other security
will be required in the amount of twenty-five percent (25%) of all dedicated
Public Improvements.

§ 184.12  INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   General procedure and fees. The City Public Works Department
shall provide for the inspection of required public improvements during
construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall
pay the city an inspection fee as established by resolution pursuant to §
169.004, and the subdivision plat shall not be signed by city officials
unless such fee has been paid at the time of application. No building
permits, certificate of occupancies, or certificates of completion shall be
issued until all fees are paid. If the Public Works Department inspector
finds that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the city's construction standards and specifications, the
applicant shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the
cost of the improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and
the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the
improvements according to specifications.



   (B)   Release of performance bond; certificate of completion. The
city will not release nor reduce a performance bond until the City Engineer
has submitted a certificate stating that all the required improvements have
been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant's engineer or surveyor
has certified to the City Engineer, through the submission of a detailed
“as-built” survey of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions,
materials and other information required by the City Engineer, that the
layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with
construction plans for the subdivision. Upon such approval and
recommendation, the city may accept the improvements for dedication in
accordance with the process and procedures outlined in Chapter 182, public
improvements.

§ 184.14  DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.



   The City Council may defer or waive at the time of final approval,
subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.

permitted under this section per subdivision;



      (7)   Builders must certify in writing that title will remain

subdivision certificate of completion is granted. In no case shall a
Certificate of Occupancy be granted for a home until the certificate of
completion has been issued;



      (8)   The builder must bond the estimated cost of demolition
of the structures should the subdivision improvements not be completed and
the building permit expires or is revoked.  Said demolition must occur
within one (1) year of notification from the City or the City shall demolish
the structures utilizing the bond proceeds.

duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Land Development Division and
submitted to the County E-911 office.

      (1)   Street improvements. In order to provide for roads of
suitable location, width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic
and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation and road
maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient
system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following road
standards are hereby required:



         (a)   Street improvements shall be provided in each new
subdivision in accordance with the Public Works Manual and the requirements
described in the following schedules.

streets connecting the development with an existing improved system.



            5.   For streets, curbs, sidewalks, driveways,
etc., the city hereby adopts the public works manual and is made a part
hereof by reference. All subdivision improvements shall comply with these
standards insofar as they are applicable.



      (2)   Layout of local street. Local streets shall be so laid
out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.



      (3)   Subdivision abuts arterial or major collector street.
Where a subdivision abuts an existing or proposed arterial or major collector
street, the City Council may require frontage access streets, reverse
frontage with screening consisting of a six-foot wall, fence or berm with
landscaping contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property
line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.



      (4)   Subdivision borders on railroad or limited access

subdivision must connect to the city water system.



      (3)   Parcels located within areas that do not have either
water or sewer lines available to them shall be required to provide both
water and sewer to the subdivision, unless each lot is a minimum of one (1)
acre in size. If both water and sewer are brought to the site, than the
minimum lot size shall be consistent with what is provided for in the
applicable Zoning District.

§ 185.007  ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.



   The city is divided into zoning districts as specified in §§ 185.030
et seq. and §§ 185.060 et seq. and as shown on the official zoning map of
the city.



('74 Code, § 25-51)  (Ord. 89-08, passed 4-27-89)



§ 185.008  ZONING MAP.



   (A)   Identification of official map.  The official zoning map
shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk
under the following: “This is to certify that this is the official zoning
map referred to in the Palm Bay Zoning Ordinance,” together with the date
of adoption of this chapter.



   (B)   Changes in district boundaries.  If, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other applicable law, changes are made in the
district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map,
such changes shall be made on the official zoning map promptly after the
amendment has been approved by City Council. The official zoning map shall
contain a listing by date and ordinance or resolution number of all changes.



   (C)   Final authority as to zoning status.  Regardless of the
existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may, from time
to time, be made or published, the official zoning map shall be kept under
the responsible charge of the Growth Management Director or his designee and
shall be the final graphic authority as to the current zoning status of all
lands, waters and structures in the city. However, the legal description of
all zoning or rezoning ordinances or resolutions, if applicable, shall be the
final legal authority as to the zoning status of land.



   (D)   Replacement of official zoning map.  In the event that the
official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to
interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City
Council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map which shall
supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning
map, hut no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original
zoning code or any subsequent amendment thereof. Unless the prior official
zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any
significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved together with all
available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.



   (E)   Retention of earlier zoning map.  All zoning maps or
remaining portions thereof which have had official force and effect in the
city prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be retained as a
public record and as a guide to the zoning status of lands and water under
the jurisdiction of the city prior to the adoption of this chapter.



   (F)   Updating zoning base maps.  From time to time the zoning base
map(s) may be updated to reflect new annexations, streets, or subdivisions
formally approved by the City Council without further official action by the
Council. No revision of zoning boundaries is permitted except by ordinance.



   (G)   Changes to map.  No zoning changes shall be made on the
official zoning map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the
procedures set forth  in  this  chapter.  Any  unauthorized change of
whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of
this chapter and punishable as provided under this chapter.

centerline of streets, highways, alleys or rights-of-way shall be construed
as to follow such centerlines. In the event a right-of-way is vacated, the
district boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except when
ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center in which
case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership.



('74 Code, § 25-62)



   (B)   Boundaries approximately following platted lot lines. 
Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be

shore lines, and in the event of change  the  bulkhead or shore line shall
be construed as moving with the newly established bulkhead line or the actual
shore line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines
of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be
construed to follow such centerlines. 



('74 Code, § 25-66)



   (F)   Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water. 
Boundaries that are indicated as entering any body of water, but not
continuing to intersect with other zoning boundaries shall be construed as
extending in the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersect
with other zoning districts.



('74 Code, § 25-67)



   (G)   Boundaries approximately parallel to or extensions of above
features.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features

§ 185.031  RR — RURAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent.  The provisions of this district are intended to
apply to areas uniquely suited for the development and maintenance of rural
single-family residential living combined with limited agricultural
activities.  Large  lot sizes are required to maintain the  low 
density  rural  character,  prevent unsanitary conditions, and provide
sufficient open space to ensure that the various principal uses are kept at a
level of compatible land use intensity.



   (B)   Principal uses and structures:



      (1)   Single-family dwellings.



      (2)   General agricultural activities limited to farming,
grove agriculture, plant nursery (wholesale only), tree farming, and flower

provided the total of all such animals shall not exceed five (5) for each one
half (½) acre of lot area.



      (8)   The acreage used in determining the number of animals
that may be kept upon the premises may only be used for one (1) type of
animal. For example, an acre of land would allow for two (2) horses, but it
would not allow for an additional five (5) goats. The land needed to support
one type of animal cannot in turn be counted to permit further animals. This
provision is to protect the health of the animal(s) and to ensure the
residential character of the neighborhood is maintained.



   (C)   Accessory uses and structures:



      (1)   Customary accessory uses of a noncommercial nature
clearly incidental and subordinate to one (1) or more principal uses.

§ 185.055  PLANNED COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PCRD).



   (A)   Intent. The planned community redevelopment district is a
concept which encourages and permits variation in mixed use developments by
allowing deviation in lot size, bulk or type of dwellings, density, height,
lot coverage and open space from that required in any classification under
the zoning regulations of the city. The purpose is to encourage the
development of planned communities that provide a broad range of residence
types as well as commercial uses designed to serve the inhabitants of the
development, the redevelopment district and the



city as a whole. It is recognized that only through ingenuity, imagination
and flexibility can developments be produced which are in keeping with the
intent of this subchapter, the Bayfront Redevelopment District Plan and the
City of Palm Bay Comprehensive Plan, while departing from the strict
application of the conventional use and dimension requirements of other
zoning districts and subdivision regulations.



   (B)   Establishment of Planned Community Redevelopment Districts.
These districts may be applied within the Bayfront Community Redevelopment
District established by the city. Such districts must be established by
amendment of the official zoning map and shall carry a zoning designation of
PCR. The PCR District may be requested in any zoning category except BMUV,
Bayfront Mixed Use Village District, LI, Light Industrial and Warehousing
District and HI, Heavy Industrial District.

enhancement of commercial development within the community redevelopment
district. The amount of the contribution shall be determined by the City
Council provided that a minimum of $33.75 per square feet of commercial not

§ 185.056  RAC - REGIONAL ACTIVITY CENTER DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent. The regional activity center (RAC) zoning district is
a planned development intended to establish types of development and
arrangements of land uses that are consistent with the comprehensive plan,
but which are not otherwise provided for or allowed in the zoning districts
set out in this chapter. The range of uses and development intensities
allowed within a particular RAC district, along with any corresponding
development and design standards are established by an associated RAC concept
plan. Subsequent development within the RAC district is implemented by the
approval of one or more site and development plans, known as RAC final
development plans.



   The standards for creating a new RAC district and its associated
concept plan set out herein are intended to promote flexibility of design and
permit planned diversification and integration of uses and structures. The
process set out herein allows the City Council to evaluate applications to
establish new RAC districts and their associated concept plans, to make
modifications to adopted concept plans, and to render final determination as
to whether applications should be approved, approved with conditions, or
denied. In addition, the City Council may, through approval with conditions,
establish such additional limitations and regulations as are deemed necessary
to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Specifically, the
RAC district is intended to:



      (1)   Promote more efficient and economical uses of land.



      (2)   Provide flexibility to meet changing needs,
technologies, economics, and consumer preferences.



      (3)   Encourage uses of land which reduce transportation needs
and which conserve energy and natural resources to the maximum extent
possible.



      (4)   Preserve to the greatest extent possible, and utilize in
a harmonious fashion, existing environmental features and amenities.



      (5)   Provide for more usable and suitably located
recreational facilities, open spaces and scenic areas, either commonly owned
or publicly owned, than would otherwise be provided under a conventional
zoning district.



      (6)   Lower development and building costs by permitting
smaller networks of utilities and streets and the use of more economical
building types and shared facilities.



      (7)   Permit the combining and coordinating of land uses,
building types, and building relationships within a planned development,
which otherwise would not be provided under a conventional zoning district.



   (B)   Establishment of a new RAC district and adoption of an
associated concept plan.

§ 185.057  PMU—PARKWAY MIXED USE DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent. The Parkway Mixed Use (PMU) zoning district is a
Planned Development intended to establish types of development and
arrangements of land uses that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan,
but which are not otherwise provided for or allowed in the zoning districts
set out in this chapter. Subsequent development within the PMU district is
implemented by the approval of one or more site and development plans, known
as Final PMU Development Plans. The purpose of planned developments is to
encourage the creation of designed neighborhoods and communities that provide
a full range of residence types, as well as commercial uses that serve the
inhabitants of the immediate community and surrounding neighborhoods.



   The standards for creating a new PMU district set out herein are
intended to promote flexibility of design and diversification and integration
of uses and structures. The process set out herein allows the City Council to
evaluate applications to establish new PMU districts and to render final
determination as to whether applications should be approved, approved with
conditions, or denied. In addition, the City Council may establish such
additional limitations and regulations as are deemed necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.  Specifically, the PMU district
is intended to:



      (1)   Promote more efficient and economical uses of land.



      (2)   Provide flexibility to meet changing needs,
technologies, economics, and consumer preferences.

and which conserve energy and natural resources to the maximum extent
possible.



      (4)   Preserve to the greatest extent possible, and utilize in
a harmonious fashion, existing environmental features and amenities; with an
emphasis on preserving existing exceptional specimen trees, to be
incorporated into the development.



      (5)   Lower development and building costs by permitting
smaller networks of utilities and streets and the use of more economical
building types and shared facilities.



      (6)   Simplification of the procedure for obtaining approval
of proposed developments through the combining and coordinating of land uses,
building types, and building relationships within a planned



development, which otherwise would not be provided under a conventional
zoning district.

§ 185.061  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   The planned unit development is a concept which encourages and
permits variation in residential developments by  allowing deviation  in
lot size, bulk or type of dwellings, density, lot coverage, setbacks, open
space, and other Land Development Regulations  and open space from that
required in any one (1) residential land use classification under the zoning
regulations of the city. The purpose of a planned unit development is to
encourage the development of planned residential neighborhoods and
communities that provide a full range of residence types as well as
commercial uses designed to serve the inhabitants of the planned unit
development. It is recognized that only through ingenuity, imagination and
flexibility can residential developments be produced which are in keeping
with the intent of this subchapter, while departing from the strict
application of conventional use and dimension requirements of other zoning
districts and subdivision regulations.



   (B)   This subchapter is intended to establish procedures and
standards for planned unit developments of the city in order that the
following objectives may be attained:



      (1)   Accumulation of large areas of usable open spaces for
recreation and preservation of natural amenities.



      (2)   Flexibility in design to take the greatest advantage of
natural land, trees, historical and other features.



      (3)   Creation of a variety of housing types and compatible
neighborhood arrangements that give the home buyer greater choice in
selecting types of environment and living units.



      (4)   Allowance of sufficient freedom for the developer to
take a creative approach to the use of land and related physical development,
as well as, utilizing innovative techniques to enhance the visual character
of the county.



      (5)   Efficient use of land which may result in smaller street
and utility networks and reduce development costs.



      (6)   Establishment of criteria for the inclusion of
compatible associated uses to complement the residential areas within the
planned unit development.



      (7)   Simplification of the procedure for obtaining approval
of proposed developments through simultaneous review of the city of proposed
land use, site consideration, lot and setback considerations, public needs
and requirements, and health and safety factors.



      (8)   Economical and efficient use of land, utilities and
streets with resulting lower housing costs.

building devoted primarily to a commercial use shall be built or established
prior to the primary residential buildings or uses it is designed or intended
to serve.



   (C)   Hotels, motels and restaurants. Hotels, motels, and
restaurants may be permitted upon a consideration of the following criteria:



      (1)   The total acreage used for the hotel, motel, and
restaurant, including necessary parking, support buildings, grounds and
appurtenances shall not be considered common open space and shall be included
within the maximum total acreage percentage permitted under this subchapter
for commercial uses.



      (2)   The proposed streets and traffic flow and the streets,
thoroughfares, and traffic plan in the area adjacent to the site plan shall

CONDITIONAL USES



§ 185.085  INTENT.



   Certain land uses, due to their unique functional characteristics and
the potentiality for their incompatibility with adjoining land uses, require
special consideration on an individual basis of their suitability for
location and development within particular zoning districts. Such uses have
been designated as conditional uses within appropriate zoning district
classifications set forth in §§ 185.030 et seq. and §§ 185.060 et seq. 
It is the intent of this subchapter that such uses may be permitted in the
zoning district classifications only after affirmative findings that they can
be developed at particular locations in a compatible manner.

         (b)   Change of use. The number of parking and loading
spaces required by this section may be reduced when the use of a building is
changed or reduced to a use or floor area for which fewer parking or loading
spaces are required. When the use is changed to a use for which more parking
or loading spaces are required, the number of spaces shall be increased to
comply with the off-street parking schedule and design standards. Off-street
parking requirements may be met with shared or remote parking areas as
described elsewhere in § 185.140. A change in use, substantial renovation,
or expansion of an existing shopping center will not require additional
parking spaces provided the cumulative change of use, renovation, or
expansion is consistent with the historic mix of tenants at the center.

or office served.



      (6)   Where off-street parking is required, such parking shall
be provided on the same lot or premises with the business or office which is
being served. In the event the use of the lot or premises expands or changes
and would require additional parking that cannot be accommodated on-site, the
parking requirement may be satisfied off-site if deemed appropriate by formal
submission of a site plan to the Planning and Zoning Board and City Council.

thousand (50,000) square feet, one (1) space. One (1) additional loading
space shall be provided for each additional fifty thousand (50,000) square
feet, or fractional part thereof, for buildings larger than fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet.



      (4)   For any use not specifically mentioned in this section,
the requirements for off-street loading for a use which is mentioned and to
which the unmentioned use is similar shall apply. Where there is any question
as to the off-street loading needs of any other use, the number shall be
determined and fixed by the Growth Management Director, or designee.



   (E)   Off-street loading facilities to meet the needs of one (1) use
shall not be considered as meeting the off-street loading needs of any other
use.



   (F)   No area supplied to meet the required off-street parking areas
for a use shall be utilized for or be deemed to meet the requirements of this
section for off-street loading facilities.



   (G)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the collective, joint or
combined provision of off-street loading facilities for two (2) or more
buildings or uses; provided, that such off-street loading facilities are
equal in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several
buildings or uses and are so located and arranged as to be usable thereby.



   (H)   Plans for buildings or uses requiring off-street loading
facilities under the provisions of this section shall clearly indicate the
location, dimensions, clearance and access of such required off-street
loading facilities

passed 4-21-16)



§ 185.142  OFF-STREET PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.



   Wherever in any zoning district, off-street parking areas in excess of
one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet, or five (5) spaces, exist,
such parking areas and land shall conform to the minimum landscaping
requirements set forth in this section; except, that single- and two-family
residential uses on individually platted lots and multilevel parking
structures shall be exempt from such requirements. All landscaped areas shall
be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs, wheel stops or other
similar devices. Existing trees may be used to meet the requirements of this
section.



   (A)   Plant material.



      (1)   Existing vegetation. The preservation and maintenance of
existing native vegetation is strongly encouraged. Native species such as
oaks, pines, sabal palms, red maples and mangroves having a trunk height of
at least six (6) feet or having a caliper of at least two (2) inches may
substitute for the tree planting requirements stated in this section.
Existing vegetation may also substitute for buffer requirements along
interior lot lines if such vegetation creates an opaque screen and has a
caliper of at least two (2) inches. The following species, however, are not
to be used as substitutes for the requirements in this section nor shall they
be planted:



   Botanical name (common names)



   Casuarina (Australian pine, beefwood)



   Melaleuca (cajeput, punk tree, paperbark tree)



   Eucalyptus (gum tree)



   Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper)



   Ricinus cummunis (castor bean)



   Melia azedarach (chinaberry)



   Enterolobium cyclocarpum (ear tree)



   Sapium sebiferum (Chinese Tallow)



   Cupaniopsis anacardioides (Carrotwood)



   Leucaena leucocephala (White Leadtree)



      (2)   Drought tolerant vegetation. A minimum of fifty percent
(50%) of total cumulative landscape plant material used to meet the provision
of  this section shall be drought tolerant as classified in the most recent
edition of the St. Johns Water Management District Xeriscape Plant Guide, or
other comparable publications approved by the Planning Division. Existing
vegetation may be used to fulfill the requirements of this section.



      (3)   (a)   Trees. All trees shall be species having an
average mature spread or crown spread of fifteen (15) feet or greater in area
and having trunks which can be maintained in a clean condition with over six
(6) feet of clear wood measured from the ground. Trees having an average
mature spread or crown less than fifteen (15) feet may be substituted by
grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a fifteen (15) foot crown
spread. Tree species shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in overall height at
time of planting. Tree species whose roots are known to cause damage to
public road ways or other public works shall not be planted closer than
twelve (12) feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is
completely contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior
dimensions shall be five (5) feet square and five (5) feet deep, and for
which construction requirements shall be four (4) inch thick concrete
reinforced with No. 6 load mesh (6×6×6) or equivalent.



         (b)   No single species of tree shall be used to total
more than fifty (50%) percent of the required number of trees.



      (4)   Palms. Palm trees may be used as a part of a landscaping
plan; however, palms shall not be used to fill more than thirty percent (30%)
of the requirements of this section. Existing native palms on site should be
used and can substitute if the palms have a clear trunk height of at least
six (6) feet or a caliper of at least six (6) inches.



      (5)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of three
(3) feet overall in height when measured at planting. Hedges, where required,
shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid
visual screen within six (6) months after time of planting.



      (6)   Ground covers. Ground covers used in lieu of grasses
shall be planted so as to present a finished appearance. The use of marl,
crushed shell, coquina, or other road base material as a ground cover is
unacceptable. Railroad ties, wood, bricks, stones, and synthetic materials
can be used to separate landscape areas, but cannot be used in place of
required ground cover.



      (7)   Lawn grass. Lawn grasses shall be planted in grass
species normally grown as permanent lawns in the county such as, but not
limited to bahia, St. Augustine, and Bermuda species. All landscape areas to
contain lawn grass shall be completely covered with solid sod. Solid sod
shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. Grass sod shall be
clean and reasonably free of weeds, noxious pests or disease.



      (8)   Artificial plant material. Artificial plant material or
artificial lawns or plants cannot be used.



      (9)   Conformance with state standards. All plant material
used shall conform to the standards for Florida No. 1, or better, as given in
Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, State of Florida, Department of
Agriculture.



      (10)   Mulch.  All areas of required landscaping shall be
mulched unless completely covered with grass or other approved ground cover.



      (11)   Vines. Plants which require support to reach mature
form. Vines shall be planted no further apart than three (3) feet from each
other when used to meet the requirements of division (B)(3)(g) below.



   (B)   Development standards.



      (1)   Where parking areas are provided, there shall be
required landscaping between such area and any abutting right-of-way as
follows:



         (a)   A strip of land at least ten (10) feet in depth
located adjacent to an abutting right-of-way shall be landscaped to include
an average of one (1) tree for each fifty (50) linear feet or fractional part
thereof. These trees shall have a minimum two (2) inch caliper with a height
of ten (10) feet at time of planting.



         (b)   In addition, a hedge, wall, berm or other opaque
durable landscape barrier of at least three (3) feet in height shall be
placed along the entire length of the abutting right-of-way. Shrubs shall be
planted twenty four (24) inches apart; this requirement shall apply to all
sections of the landscape code where the planting of shrubs is required. If
such opaque, durable barrier is of nonliving material, shrubs or vines shall
be planted in such a manner as to break up the expanse of the wall. A two (2)
foot berm may be used; however, additional landscaping at least one (1) foot
in height at time of planting shall be installed. The remainder of the
required landscape areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or
other landscape treatment.



         (c)   Large parcels. When multi-family or
non-residential parcels or tracts of land contain frontage that exceeds three
hundred (300') linear feet, these developments shall plant one (1) tree per
thirty (30) linear feet, or fractional part thereof, for the entire length of
the frontage. Trees may be clumped, provided that spacing between tree trunks
is no greater than fifty (50) feet. The frontage shall also contain one (1)
shrub per two (2) linear feet and these shrubs shall be a minimum of three
(3) feet in height at time of planting.



      (2)   Required landscaping adjacent to interior property lines:



         (a)   Where parking areas abut property zoned or, in
fact, used primarily for residential or institutional purposes, that portion
of such area not entirely screened visually by an intervening structure or
existing conforming buffer from an abutting property shall be provided a
landscaped buffer which shall be maintained and replaced as needed. Such
landscaped buffer shall consist of plant material, wall or other durable
barrier at least six (6) feet in height measured from the median elevation of
the parking area closest to the common lot line, and shall be located between
the common lot line and the abutting property. Where the screen is composed
of plant material capable of reaching six (6) feet in height, it shall be at
least thirty-six (36) inches in height at time of planting and shall attain
opacity within twelve (12) months under normal growing conditions.



         (b)   In addition, an average of one (1) tree shall be
provided for each thirty-five (35) linear feet of such parking area or
fractional part thereof, adjacent to the common lot line, or a ratio equal to
one (1) tree per thirty-five (35) linear feet of fifty percent (50%) of the
length of the common lot line, whichever is greater. Trees within perimeter
landscape strips may be grouped, but the distance between these trees shall
not exceed fifty (50) feet. These trees shall have a minimum two (2) inch
caliper with a height of ten (10) feet at time of planting. Each such tree
shall be planted in at least twenty-five (25) square feet of planting area
with a minimum dimension of at least five (5) feet. Each such planting area
shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape treatment.



         (c)   Where such area abuts a dedicated alley or
property zoned and, in fact, used for office, commercial or industrial
purposes, that portion of area not entirely screened visually by an
intervening structure or existing conforming buffer shall comply with the
tree provisions only as prescribed in this section.



         (d)   1.   Where a drainage or utility easement or
right-of-way separates the parcel containing the off-street parking area and
abutting properties or public rights-of-way, the provisions of this section
shall apply unless the easements or rights-of-way contain trees which meet
the planting and number requirements of this section. Should these trees be
removed or die, the requirements of this section must be met.



            2.   Where drainage facilities or drainage or
utility easements exist along the lot lines within the parcel containing
off-street parking areas, the required trees shall not be placed in any
drainage facility or easement; however, trees may be located along the edge
of drainage facilities.



      (3)   Required interior parking area landscaping.



         (a)   All parking areas shall be internally landscaped
to provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement and to
channelize and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
Interior landscaping, excluding required parking setbacks, shall account for
ten percent (10%) of the total parking area. Landscape dividing strips, with
or without walkways, shall be used to subdivide the parking area into rows
with not more than an average of ten (10) spaces, per row except that parking
rows adjacent to required landscape row dividers shall only be required such
landscape strips at the end of each landscape row divider.



         (b)   Each separate landscape area shall contain a
minimum of one hundred (100) square feet and shall have a minimum dimension
of at least ten (10) feet, measured at its narrowest area, except that
islands required to be designed with turn radii are permitted to have less
than ten (10) feet if approved by the Growth Management Director, or
designee, and shall include at least one (1) tree, with the remaining area
meeting the requirements of this code. The total number of trees shall not be
less than one (1) per two hundred (200) square feet or fraction thereof of
required interior landscaped area and shall exclude those trees required
along the perimeter of the parcel. Such landscaped areas shall be protected
from vehicular encroachment by curbs, wheelstops or landscape timbers.
Whenever an off-street parking area is designed to provide parking of
vehicles in five (5) rows or more, at least one (1) interior landscaped area
not less than ten (10) feet in width shall be provided the length of the
parking rows, with at least one (1) landscaped row divider required for every
five (5) parking rows. Landscaped areas, including landscaped islands, within
or abutting vehicular use areas shall be excavated to a depth of two (2) feet
to remove lot base course material, lime rock, asphalt, concrete, and similar
material in order to ensure that adequate planting soil exists.



         (c)   In other parking areas where the strict
application of this section will seriously limit the function of such areas,
such as off-street loading areas, the required landscaping may be located
near the perimeter of the paved area. Such interior landscaping which is
relocated as herein provided shall be in addition to the perimeter
landscaping requirements.



         (d)   The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any
interior landscaped area or walkway when the area is at least three and
one-half (3½) feet in depth per abutting parking space and protected by
motor vehicle stops or curbing. An overhang may be permitted in such
landscaped area or walkway. If shrubs or hedges are planted in front of such
parking areas, the shrubs must be planted a minimum of three and one-half
(3½) feet from the back of the curb or wheel stop to prevent damage to the
hedge.



         (e)   Interior landscaped areas may be used for
retention and detention sites for groundwater recharge.



         (f)   All garbage/refuse containers shall be screened on
at least three (3) sides by concrete block, fencing or other materials at
least six (6) feet in height which renders the view of the container opaque.



         (g)   Landscape vines, shrubs, or a combination of the
two, are required to be planted along the outside of subdivision walls and/or
any required masonry walls facing canal, road, or other rights-of-way.



      (4)   Pedestrian zone landscaping.



         (a)   A pedestrian zone is defined as a setback from any
building facade facing a parking area or driveway, excluding the rear of the
building. In no case shall the required pedestrian zone have an area less
than ten (10) feet in width; nor shall more than five (5) feet of the width
of the required pedestrian zone be paved, except for necessary access
perpendicular to building entries. A minimum of five (5) feet of the width of
the required pedestrian zone shall be clear of roof overhand. For drive-thru
facilities, the length of a building containing the drive-thru window(s), or
the loading/unloading spaces and overhead doors in industrial/warehouse or
commercial buildings shall be exempt from these provisions.



         (b)   Plant materials. All multi-family and all
non-residential development shall have at least two (2) trees planted per
pedestrian zone, except for areas under a canopy. The requirements of this
subsection concerning pedestrian zone trees shall not apply for gasoline
stations if such trees cause a line of sight obstruction.



      (5)   Replacement Trees. The requirements for replacement
trees listed in § 180.16(E) shall be observed. However, under extenuating
circumstances where the requirements conflict with best horticulture
practices for tree planting, some number of these trees may be planted within
publically-owned lands. The number, location, and placement thereon, shall be
approved by the Growth Management Director, or designee. As an alternative to
planting the trees off-site, the developer may choose to mitigate said trees
through the payment of a fee, into the Palm Bay Tree Replacement Trust Fund.
The replacement contribution shall be as provided for in latest fee
resolution.



   (C)   Intersection visibility.  Where an aisle, driveway, sidewalk,
bike path or other access way intersects a public right-of-way, 
landscaping  shall be used to define the intersection, provided, however,
all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall provide
unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between two (2) and six (6) feet.
Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or
foliage extend into cross-visibility shall be allowed, provided they are so
located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except grass and
ground cover, shall not be located closer than three (3) feet from the edge
of any access way pavement. The triangular areas are:



      (1)   The areas of property on both sides of an aisle,
driveway or other access way formed by the intersection of each side of the
aisle, driveway or access way and the public right-of-way pavement line with
two (2) sides of each triangle being ten (10) feet in length from the point
of intersection and the third side being in line connecting the ends of the
two (2) other sides.



      (2)   The area of property located at a corner formed by the
intersection of two (2) or more public streets with two (2) sides of the
triangular area being measured thirty (30) feet in length along the
right-of-way line (or in the case of an arc, the extensions of the
right-of-way lines) from their point of intersection, and the third being a
line connecting the ends of the other two (2) lines.



   (D)   Installation and maintenance.



      (1)   All landscaping shall be installed to accepted
commercial planting procedures. Soil, which is free of lime rock, pebbles or
other construction debris shall be provided. The owner of the property shall
be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition so as
to present a neat, healthy and orderly appearance free of refuse and debris.
All landscaped areas shall be provided with an irrigation system or available
water supply with at least one (1) outlet located within one hundred and
fifty (150) feet of the plant material. Where existing vegetation is used to
meet the requirement along public rights-of-way or interior lot lines a water
supply is not required. In order to reduce irrigation requirements, the
following water saving techniques will be encouraged:



         (a)   The use of reclaimed wastewater where available;



         (b)   The use of drought tolerant ground cover instead
of lawn grass;



         (c)   Watering schedules for automatic systems to reduce
irrigation in the rainy summer and dormant winter seasons;



         (d)   The commitment to irrigate between sunset and
sunrise when evaporation is minimal;



         (e)   Irrigation systems shall be designed to the
greatest extent practical, water being applied to impervious areas is
eliminated;



         (f)   The use of xeric landscaping techniques.



      (2)   If any living material that is required by this code and
shown on the approved site/landscape plan dies or fails to achieve normal
growth, it shall be replaced within thirty (30) days of notification from the
Growth Management Director, or designee. Such replacement landscaping shall
meet all requirements of this code and the approved site/landscape plan.
Failure to maintain the minimum landscape requirements of this section shall
constitute a violation of this code.



      (3)   Pruning and topping. Pruning restrictions shall not
apply for trees located under power lines. Trees shall be pruned only as
necessary to promote healthy growth. Trees shall be allowed to attain their
normal size and shall not be severely pruned or “hat racked” in order to
permanently maintain growth at a reduced height. Trees may be periodically
pruned or thinned in order to reduce leaf mass in preparation for tropical
storms All pruning shall be accomplished in accordance with the National
Arborist’s Standards.



   (E)   Site plan data. Applicants for building permits shall submit a
landscape plan containing the following:



      (1)   An engineering scale (One (1) inch equals twenty (20)
feet preferred).



      (2)   Property lines.



      (3)   Dimensions.



      (4)   Structures.



      (5)   Accurate parking lot design showing parking spaces,
aisles, loading areas, driveways, islands, signs, and parking lot or security
light fixtures and the like.



      (6)   Calculations of total square footage of the parking and
landscaped areas as well as indicating the number and location of existing
trees to be used and the number of new trees to be planted.



      (7)   Location of water lines or other underground utilities,
fire hydrants and other above ground utility fixtures.



      (8)   Grading plan.



      (9)   Plant specification list which is keyed to the plan and
contains the botanical name, common name, estimated sizes at planting and at
maturity (crown spread and height), quantity of each, and how transplanted to
the site (container stock, bare root, balled or burlapped).



   (F)   Nuisance Vegetation. All recognized nuisance trees (i.e.
pepper trees, Australian pines, etc.) shall be removed during site
preparation and perpetually removed (upon re- growth) after issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.



   (G)   The provisions of this section shall apply to all new
off-street parking areas.



   (H)   At such time as existing off-street parking or other vehicular
use areas are enlarged, the enlarged areas shall meet the provisions of this
section. The newly enlarged areas shall not cause the existing parking area
landscaping to be more nonconforming.



   (I)   At such time as existing off-street parking or other vehicular
use areas are modified, the modification shall not cause the existing parking
area landscaping to be more  nonconforming. The intent of this provision is
that any existing off-street parking or vehicular use areas shall, when
feasible, become more conforming to the landscaping requirements of this
section. Determination of the feasibility of modifying the existing parking
or vehicular use areas, to become more conforming, shall be made by the
Growth Management Director, or designee.  This determination shall be based
on the following considerations:



      (1)   Cost of compliance with specific criteria in the parking
area landscaping code;



      (2)   Physical space available within the existing areas to
comply with specific criteria in the parking area landscaping codes, such as
existing "green" spaces;



      (3)   The extent that existing conditions represent safety
hazards; and



      (4)   The extent to which modification addresses other
criteria within the Code of Ordinances, such as, but not limited to, enhanced
landscape installation, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), stormwater management requirements, and similar regulations.



('74 Code, § 25-193)  (Ord. 89-08, passed 4-27-89; Am. Ord. 94-04, passed

§ 185.143  LIGHTING STANDARDS.



   It is the intent of this Code to define practical and effective
measures by which the commercial outdoor light usage can be reduced, while
preserving safety, security, and the nighttime use and enjoyment of property.
These measures are intended to curtail the degradation of the nighttime
visual environment, reduce light trespass, glare, energy consumption and
resource waste by encouraging lighting practices that direct appropriate
amounts of light where and when it is needed, increasing the use of
energy-efficient sources, and decreasing the use of poorly shielded or
inappropriately directed lighting fixtures.



   (A)   Conformance standards. All outdoor lighting shall be installed
in conformance with the provisions of this Code, the Florida Building Code,
the National Electrical Code, the Energy Code, and the Sign Code of Palm Bay
and under appropriate permit and inspection.



   (B)   Applicability. New Uses, Buildings and Major Additions or
Modifications. For all proposed new land uses, developments, buildings, and
structures that require a permit, all outdoor lighting shall meet the
requirements of this Code. All building additions or modifications of fifty
percent (50%) or more in terms of additional dwelling units, gross floor
area, or parking spaces, either with a single addition or with cumulative
additions subsequent to the effective date of this provision, shall invoke
the requirements of this Code for the entire site, including previously
installed and any new outdoor lighting. Cumulative modification or
replacement of outdoor lighting constituting fifty (50) percent or more of
the permitted lumens for the parcel, no matter the actual amount of lighting
already on a non-conforming site, shall constitute a major addition for
purposes of this section.



   (C)   General outdoor lighting standards.



      (1)   Shielding Standards. All nonexempt outdoor lighting
fixtures shall have shielding so that the total lumen output falls to zero
(0.00) at the property line. (Exception: ) seasonal decorative lighting (i.e.
Christmas Lights) using typical low-wattage incandescent or LED lamps shall
be permitted in all zoning districts from the Thanksgiving holiday through
the 15th of January.



      (2)   The use of Metal Halide (MH), Light Emitting Diode
(LED), Quartz Light (OL), and High Intensity Discharge (HID), when properly
shielded is permitted for all exterior site lighting. Other types of lamps
not listed shall be considered as a part of the permitting process.



      (3)   High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lighting is prohibited for
building and security lighting.



      (4)   The use of Low Pressure Sodium (LPS) lighting is
prohibited in all zoning districts.



      (5)   The undue lighting of the night sky by means of
searchlights and similar devices without prior approval from the City Manager
or their designee is prohibited.



      (6)   Neon Lighting, LED strip and tracer lighting and other
types of lighting used to illuminate the outline of a structure or storefront
window system is prohibited.



      (7)   No lighting fixture shall produce a lumen output
exceeding one thousand (1000) lumens in any given area.



      (8)   Poles and support structures used for outdoor lighting
shall not exceed thirty feet (30') in height. The exception shall permit for
required lighting of all communication towers or tall structures as mandated
by the FAA and FCC.



(Ord. 2017-15, passed 2-16-17)



NONCONFORMANCE PROVISIONS



§ 185.155  INTENT.



   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments
that may later be adopted, there exists lots, structures, uses of land and
structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments.



   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their continuation. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of
this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or

   (A)   A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of
land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by
the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in
the district involved.



   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of
any building on which an active building permit has been issued. Actual
building construction shall be diligently carried on until the, subject
structure is completed.

may be erected on any single lot that is of record on the effective date of
this section, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
code of ordinances and any other applicable ordinance of the city. Such lots
must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots
in the same ownership. These provisions shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through the procedure established in
§ 169.009.



   (B)   If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions
of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the
time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this
chapter, the lands involved shall  be  considered to be an undivided parcel
for the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used
which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this
chapter.

§ 185.158  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.



   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms
of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:



   (A)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor

a use permitted in the district in which such use is located;



   (B)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;

   (D)   No additional structure which does not conform to the
requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such
nonconforming use of land.

§ 185.159  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.



   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this,
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:



   (A)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity;



   (B)   But any structure or portion thereof may be altered to
decrease its nonconformity;



   (C)   Should such a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent
of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter;

§ 185.160  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES
IN COMBINATION.



   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of structure and
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under
the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:



   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district on which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;



   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of
a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building;



   (C)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform  to  the  regulations  for the district in which such structure
is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;



   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and
premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive
months, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located;



   (E)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction, for the purpose
of this chapter, is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the replacement cost at time of destruction.

§ 185.161  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.



   (A)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of six (6) consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of
the current replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic
content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of
this chapter shall not be increased.



   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official.

result of eminent domain  proceedings  instituted  by  the  city or
other governmental agency or through a voluntary conveyance by a lot owner in
lieu of formal eminent domain proceedings, which lot or parcel except for
such eminent domain or voluntary conveyance shall be deemed to be a
conforming lot or parcel for all purposes under this chapter. However, any
new construction or building addition shall conform to the subject yard
requirements of the applicable district. Any re-construction or maintenance
of the existing structures may be performed with no additional encroachment
into the subject yard requirements.

§ 186.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to uniformly regulate the size, number,
type and location of communication towers, antennas and support facilities. 
Advances in information technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of
1996 generated an increase in the number of requests to site commercial
communication support facilities in the city.  The city encourages advances
in communication technology that better serve its residents and does not
prohibit communication systems. However, the purpose of the chapter is to
protect city character and public safety by controlling tower, antenna, and
facilities location, height, construction, and aesthetics ensuring that
communication systems are compatible with surrounding land uses.  Moreover,
the city seeks to discourage visual clutter resulting from the potential,
simultaneous deployment and proliferation of multiple communication towers or
systems. To that end, this chapter is intended to encourage the co-location
of communication antennas on existing public or private utility facilities,
and to either camouflage antennas, towers and other communication facilities,
or minimize visual impacts of communication systems through careful design,
siting, buffering, and landscaping.

§ 186.02  DEFINITIONS.




   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.





   ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT STRUCTURE.  Any man-made structure, including but
not limited to, buildings, light poles, clock towers, bell towers/steeples,
water towers and the like, which allow for the attachment of communication
facilities.





   CAMOUFLAGED TOWER OR ANTENNA.  A communications tower or antenna
designed to unobtrusively blend into the existing surroundings and be
disguised so as not to have the appearance of a communications tower or
antenna. Camouflaged towers and antennas on developed property must be
disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing a principal
use, or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal
use.  Camouflaged towers and antennas placed on unimproved property must be
disguised to blend in with the existing vegetation.





   CO-LOCATION.  Attachment of two or more communications antennae to a
new or existing communications tower, and the attachment of one or more
communications antennas on an existing alternative support structure.

diameter used to send or receive electromagnetic waves for all types of
communication.




   COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. A facility or location designed, or intended
to be used for transmitting and/or receiving radio, television, cellular,
SMR, paging, 911, personal communications services (PCS), commercial
satellite services, microwave services, and any commercial wireless
telecommunication service whether or not it is licensed by the FCC.  This
includes without limit, towers of all types and kinds, where used, and all
related facilities and equipment such as antennas, cabling, equipment
shelters and other structures associated with the site.









   COMMUNICATIONS TOWER.  Any structure designed and constructed for the
primary purpose of supporting one or more communications antennas. Tower
shall mean the same as communications tower. Towers may be of the following

modification shall indicate an increase in the height of an existing
communications tower of no more than forty (40) feet above the
originally-permitted tower height.





   PRE-EXISTING TOWERS AND PRE-EXISTING ANTENNAS.  Any communications
tower or communications antenna for which a building permit has been issued
prior to April 1, 1998, including permitted communication towers or antenna
that have not yet been constructed, so long as such permits are valid and in
effect.





   SETBACKS.  When referring to a support structure, such as a tower or
building, setback shall mean the required distance from the support structure
to the property line of the parcel on which the communication facility is
located.





   TEMPORARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER.  Any telecommunications tower
constructed and operating in conjunction with a permitted special event.
These facilities are also known as cellulars on wheels (cows) for their
mobility. Emergency towers used to aid in post-disaster relief efforts also
fall in this category.

§ 186.09  MODIFICATION OF EXISTING TOWERS.



   (A)   Existing towers constructed prior to the effective date of
this chapter which do not meet the requirements of this chapter may continue
as a non-conforming use. These towers may be replaced or modified for
co-location, or to improve functionality as long as the height of the tower
does not exceed 40 feet above the original tower height.



   (B)   Minor modifications to communication towers shall be approved
by staff administrative review. Minor modifications include the addition of
antennas, provided either that the antennas add no more than 40 feet in
height to the tower, or that the tower is rebuilt to the same height or no
more than 40 feet above the original tower height. Prior to receiving a
building permit for the modified tower, the applicant must meet the
requirements of § 186.08(B). In lieu of submitting "full-scale" site plan
drawings, the applicant shall submit a current survey of the communications
tower facility showing not only the tower compound, but all equipment
contained within. The survey must also show the proposed equipment, and be
accompanied by a written statement, on company letter-head, describing the
amount that the tower height is being increased, if applicable. If the tower
is not being increased in height, the letter shall describe the location of
the new antennae.



   (C)   Major modifications to communication towers shall be approved
as stated in the zoning districts and may include conditional use review.
Major modifications are those that exceed the definition of minor
modifications.



   (D)    Co-locations, on alternative support structures that meet the
requirements of § 186.07(I)(1)-(4) or on existing towers, including
nonconforming structures or towers, that meet the requirements provided in
subparagraphs (1) - (3) below, are subject only to building permit review.
Such co-locations are not subject to any design or placement requirements in
effect at the time of the co-location that are more restrictive than those in
effect at the time of the initial tower or antennae placement approval, or to
public hearing review.



      (1)   The co-location does not increase the height of the
tower or structure to which the antennae are to be attached, measured to the
highest point of any part of the tower or structure or any existing antennae
attached to the tower;



      (2)   The co-location does not increase the ground space area,
commonly known as the compound, approved in the site plan for equipment
enclosures and ancillary facilities; and



      (3)   The co-location consists of antennae, equipment
enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration
consistent with all applicable regulations, restrictions, or conditions, if
any, applied to the initial antennae placed on the tower or structure and its
accompanying equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities and, if
applicable, to the tower or structure supporting the antennae. Such
regulations may include the design and aesthetic requirements, but not
procedural requirements, in effect at the time the initial tower or antennae
placement was approved.

these provisions shall not become effective until all users cease operations.



   (D)   Under the following circumstances, the Director may determine
that the health, safety and welfare of the city warrant and require removal
of communications facilities:



      (1)   A communications facility (hereinafter referred to as
facility) has fallen into such a state of disrepair as to create a health or
safety hazard;



      (2)   The tower has been modified without obtaining the
required permits to do so or the approval granted for construction of the
tower has been revoked.



   (E)   If the Director determines that a tower and/or facility shall
be removed the owner shall dismantle and remove such equipment from the site
and restore the aboveground site to as close to its original condition as
possible, within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the Director.
However, if the landowner for which the facility resides wishes to retain any
access roadway to the site, the owner may do so with the approval of the
Director.



   (F)   If the facility ordered to be removed under this section is
not removed or substantial progress has not been made to remove the facility
within the 90-day period, then the city may remove the facility at the sole
expense of the facility owner, dispose of the equipment as it sees fit, and
in order to cover the city's cost.



   (G)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the
Director may approve a temporary use agreement to operate the facility for no
more than 180 days, during which time a suitable plan for removal,
conversion, or re-location of the affected facility shall be developed by the
facility owner. This agreement, and the terms of resolution of the facility,
must be approved by the Director and signed by both the Director and the
facility owner.

§ 200.05  METER TESTING.



   (A)   Meter testing shall be done at the customer's request, and in
accordance with the following guidelines and schedules:



      (1)   Meter Test Request. If any customer requests a test of
the meter, the City will require a meter test or bench test fee which fee
shall be set as follows:



 

Meter Test
 
$81.62


Bench Test - 3/4" to 1" Meter
 
$155.91


Bench Test - 2" Meter
 
$176.83



 



      (2)   The fee is retained by the City only if the test shows
that the meter is registering within the acceptable accuracy limits as
established by the City. If the meter is determined by the City to be
registering outside of the acceptable accuracy limits, the fee will be
credited to the customer's account.



      (3)   For tests of meters equal to or greater than 1 1/2-inch
(1 ½”), the test will be based on actual costs incurred as determined by
the City.



   (B)   Adjustment of Bills for Meter Error.  In meter tests made by
the City, the accuracy of registration of the meter and its performance in
service shall be judged by its average error.  The average error shall be
considered to be the average of the errors at the test rate flows:



      (1)   Fast meters.  Whenever a meter tested is found to
register fast, in excess of the tolerance provided within the accuracy limits
by the City standards, the City shall refund to the customer the amount
billed in error for the period not to exceed six months except that if it can
be shown that the error was due to some cause, the date of which can be
fixed, the overcharge shall be computed back to but not beyond such date. 
The refund shall be based upon consumption charges only and for the
percentage over registering.



      (2)   Slow meters.  Whenever a meter tested is found to
register slow, in excess of the tolerance provided within the accuracy limits
by the City, the City may bill the customer an amount equal to the unbilled
error for the period not to exceed six months, except that if it can be shown
that the error was due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the
charge may be computed back to but not beyond such date and provided further
that if the utility has required a deposit, the customer may be billed only
for their portion of the unbilled error which is in excess of the deposit
retained by the City.  In the event of a non-registering meter, the customer
may be billed on an estimate based on previous bills for similar usages, such
estimate to apply only to the current billing.  In the event of unauthorized
use, the customer may be billed on a reasonable estimate, in the sole
discretion of the City, of the service taken.



      (3)   Meter accuracy requirements.  All meters used for
measuring quantity of water delivered to a customer shall be in good
mechanical condition and shall be adequate in size and design for the type of
service which they measure.  Before being installed for the use of any
customer, every meter shall register within the accuracy limits of the City
standards.

§ 200.06  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.



   (A)   Establishment of Credit. Before rendering Utilities services,
the City shall require an applicant to satisfactorily establish credit. 
Establishment of credit shall not relieve the customer from their obligation
to comply with the City's rules for prompt payment. Credit will be deemed so
established if:



      (1)   The applicant furnishes a satisfactory guarantor to
secure payment of bills for service requested.



      (2)   The applicant pays a deposit.



      (3)   The applicant furnishes an irrevocable letter of credit
from a bank or a surety bond.



   Any such deposit received by the City shall be held in a non-interest
bearing account. Deposits shall not be refunded until any and all outstanding
charges for Utilities services against the account for which it is deposited
have been paid in full. The deposits required under this section shall be
applied against the final bill prepared for termination of the account. If
the deposit exceeds the final bill, and no other outstanding fees or charges
exist, then the balance of the deposit shall be refunded. If a residential
customer has a record of timely payment over a continuous thirty-six
(36)-month period, then the City shall return that deposit.



   (B)   Amount of Deposit. The amount of initial deposit for each

   (C)   Deposit Waiver. The applicant may apply for a credit screening
to determine if a deposit is required or if the amount of the deposit can be
reduced or waived.  Actual cost of the credit check fee when provided by a
third-party will be imposed upon the applicant.



      Third-Party Credit Check Fee     $5.00



   (D)   Additional Deposit. The City may require a new deposit, where
previously waived or returned, or an additional deposit in order to secure
payment of current bills provided. The City shall provide the customer with
reasonable written notice of not less than thirty (30) days where such
request or notice is separate and apart from any bill for service. The total
amount of the required water or wastewater deposit shall not exceed an amount
equal to the average actual charge for services for two (2) monthly billing
periods for the twelve (12)-month period immediately prior to the date of
notice. In the event the customer has had service less than twelve (12)
months, the City shall base the new or additional deposit upon the average
actual monthly billing available.

§ 200.07  DISCONNECTING, RECONNECTING, AND TRANSFERRING SERVICE.



   (A)   There shall be a charge for City service connections and for
transferring of City accounts from the name of one person to the name of
another, which shall be paid before the service connection is made or
accounts changed.  There shall be no service connection charge if the
original service connection for meter installation or service installation
fee has been paid.



      (1)   Transferring Service. The charge for the transfer of
service to a new customer account at a previously served location or
reconnection of service subsequent to a customer requested disconnection
shall be set as follows. If after the reconnection the customer does not have
water service due to the main valve at the house being in the off position,
and the field service representative returns to the property, an additional
service initiation fee will be applied to the account for each return trip to
be set as follows:



Transfer Fee (Re-Initiation Fee) (Per Trip)



   During normal hours         $20.92



   During after hours         $64.87



Service Initiation Fee (Per Trip)



   During normal hours         $20.92



   During after hours         $64.87



      (2)   Reconnection. When service is discontinued because of
nonpayment of amounts due or non-sufficient funds, the disconnection/
reconnection fee will be applied to the account as set forth below. If
service is ordered discontinued becauseof nonpayment of the amount due, then
payment is subsequently received (thus preventing the service from being
discontinued), an administrative fee will be applied to the account.  If
service has been discontinued because of non-payment and water service is
restored without authorization by the City, the City shall remove the meter
and a pulled meter/reinstall meter charge will be applied to the account. 
Service shall not be restored until the customer has paid the entire amount
of the delinquent bill, together with penalties and the pulled
meter/reinstall meter charge.  If a meter was pulled prior to October 1,
2015, a re-install meter charge shall be applied to any account requesting to
have such meter re-installed.

short-term nature as determined acceptable by the Utilities Director.



   (C)   Applicants will be supplied with water for temporary use
according to the regular monthly service charges. They will be required to
deposit regular guarantee of payment deposit. Such deposit shall be held by
the Utilities Department as a guarantee of safety for the meter and other
equipment furnished to the applicant by the Department, and for payment of
water used. The applicant will be charged the regular tapping charge for cost
of making the tap, setting the meter and connections. Upon payment of all
charges and the removal and discontinuance of service through the meter, the
Utilities Department is authorized to refund the amount of deposits made by
the applicant for such service.



   (D)   Applicants desiring water on a temporary basis from a city
fire hydrant will be required to complete a Hydrant Use Permit Application. 
Upon submission of a completed application and payment of an installation fee
and deposit, the City will place the requested assembly at the requested
location within three (3) business days. The applicant will be required to

relocated, a relocation fee will be assessed to the account.  All requests
for relocation will be handled by Customer Service.  Only City personnel are
authorized to relocate the assembly.



   (H)   In the event a customer determines that the assigned assembly
has been vandalized, or stolen, the customer must immediately notify the
Customer Service department and law enforcement.  Failure to report the
incident will result in the forfeiture of all deposits paid.  It is the
customers' responsibility to cooperate fully with the City and law
enforcement agencies during the investigation and prosecution process.

§ 200.11  UTILITIES EXTENSION POLICY.



   (A)   Responsibility for Collection, Distribution, and Transmission
Costs.  The City shall allow an applicant to connect to the nearest feasible
point as determined by the City. In addition to the water, wastewater, or
reclaimed water capital charges, the applicant shall either provide, or pay
the capital costs (including land costs) of the required capital improvements
for:



      (1)   The collection of raw sewage within the boundaries of
the property owned by the applicant to which the City intends to provide
wastewater service capacity;



      (2)   The transmission of sewage from those boundaries to the
City's collection and transmission facilities prior to connection to
treatment facilities; and



      (3)   The transmission and distribution of water or reclaimed
water from the City's water treatment facilities to the applicant's property.



   (B)   Incorporation by Reference of Certain Standards and
Procedures.  The Code hereby references the document generally known as the
City of Palm Bay Utilities Department Policies, Procedures, and Standards
Handbook. The City reserves the right to determine the applicability of the
items referenced therein. The City also reserves the right to modify, amend,
or replace the Policies, Procedures, and Standards Handbook at any time in
the future without the need to amend this Section.  All rates shall be
controlled by the prevailing rate established by this chapter.



   (C)   Manner of Paying; Payment Prerequisite to Rendering Service. 
The City requires the payment of contributions, either by cash payments or
through the installation of water distribution and wastewater collection
facilities by the applicant.  The title to such facilities shall be
transferred to the Utilities Department upon their acceptance.  The
requirement for such contributions is declared to be for the purpose of
defraying the cost of the water distribution and wastewater collection
systems. The payment by the applicant of such contributions to the City shall
be a condition precedent to the rendering of service.



   (D)   Computation.  The aggregate value of contributions, either in
cash or by utility facilities construction donated by the applicant shall be
computed and determined as follows:



      (1)   On-site Facilities.  Each applicant shall be
responsible for the design, installation, inspection and testing of complete
distribution facilities and collection facilities located in the street or
streets, facilities rights-of-way or easements adjoining or within the
boundaries of the applicant's property, or the equivalent cost of the same in
the event such facilities have been previously designed or installed. The
requirement for the installation of oversized lines or facilities, located on
the applicant's property and designed to provide service for other
properties, may be the subject of a refunding agreement.



      (2)   Off-site Facilities.  The applicant is required to
extend service to the existing water distribution/transmission and wastewater
collection/ transmission facilities. For the purpose of this policy, the term
OFF-SITE shall be defined as those water or reclaimed water distribution and
transmission facilities, wastewater transmission facilities, collection
facilities or pumping stations necessary to connect the applicant's property
with the System adequate in size to transmit to the applicant's property an
adequate quantity of water under adequate pressure or transmit wastewater
collected on the applicant's property to the treatment plant or disposal
site. It is the City's policy to apportion the cost of the off-site
facilities pro rata against the properties receiving service from such
off-site facilities using the refundable advance approach. Since each
applicant draws from the hydraulic capacity of such facilities, the City will
require that the applicant install such facilities and pay his property's
hydraulic share as a minimum of the cost of the off-site facilities through
which service is rendered to the applicant's property.  Applicants are
required to advance all or a portion of the off-site facilities in order to
provide a physical interconnection of the applicant's property with the
facilities of the Utility at their then present terminus.



   (E)   Refundable Advance. The City requires, in many cases, in
addition to the contribution provisions set forth herein, a construction cost
advance by the applicant to further temporarily defray the cost of any
off-site facilities necessary to connect the applicant's property with the
then terminus of the facilities adequate in size to provide service as deemed
appropriate by the City. The applicant shall always be responsible for his
"hydraulic share" of the cost of off-site facilities. However, this Policy
recognizes the instances in which an applicant will be required to advance
the hydraulic share applicable to other undeveloped property in order that
off-site facilities may be constructed to serve the subject property. All
amounts expended by the applicant, over and above the hydraulic share for
off-site facilities, shall be rebated to the applicant in accordance with the
terms and conditions of a rebate agreement which the City will execute. The
rebate agreement shall provide for a plan of rebate based upon the connection
of other properties, to the extent of their hydraulic share, which properties
will be served by the off-site facilities installed by the applicant.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the City will limit the life
of such rebate agreement to a term of not more than six (6) years, after
which time any portion of the rebates not made by the terms and conditions of
the rebate agreement will have lapsed and thereafter, such rebate agreement
will be canceled. In no event shall the rebate cover an amount greater than
the difference between the capitalized cost of such off-site facilities and
the applicant's own hydraulic shares of such facilities. The City shall not
include any interest upon the rebates.



   (F)   Main Line Extension Charges. In order to recover those costs
associated with the contributed capital portion of the water or reclaimed
water distribution and wastewater collection facilities, the City and
Utilities Department hereby adopt Main Line Extension Charges as set forth
above. Normally, such capital is contributed by the applicant to the City and
Utilities Department upon hook-up to the system. For those occasions where
the City and Utilities Department or their predecessor completes or has
completed the extension from the respective transmission system to the
applicant's property, a fee set as follows for the water, wastewater, and
reclaimed water system shall be levied and collected from the owner. The fee
will be calculated based on the amount of front footage each specific
property occupies upon its respective roadway.



   Main Line Extension Charges (per linear foot)



      Water      $18.80



      Wastewater   $29.63



   (G)   Time of Payment.  All water or reclaimed water distribution
and wastewater collection main line extension charges shall be paid prior to
connection to a structure to be served by the City or such other time as may
be specifically provided by resolution, ordinance, agreement or permit.  The
City may permit installment payments of any water or reclaimed water
distribution and wastewater collection main line fee charges upon such terms
and conditions as it deems appropriate.



   (H)   System Design; Independent Engineers.  The City and Utilities
Department shall recognize the design of the facilities prepared by a
registered professional engineer regularly engaged in the field of sanitary
engineering, covering the design of applicant's on-site facilities.  Such
design shall conform in all respects to the City and Utilities Department's
criteria.  Such facilities shall ultimately be accepted by the City based on
a recommendation by the Utilities Department.



   (I)   Easement and Rights-of-Way. As a prerequisite to the
construction of any facilities proposed to be connected to the System, the
applicant shall agree to grant such easements or rights-of-way corresponding
with the installation of the proposed facilities. Such grant or conveyance
shall be in a form satisfactory to the City.



   (J)   Inspection. The City shall have the right to inspect the
installation of all facilities which are proposed to be transferred to
Utilities Department ownership, operation and control, or any other on-site
facilities whether or not transferred to the Utilities Department. Such
inspections are intended to assure that the collection facilities or
distribution facilities are installed in accordance with approved designs and
are further consistent with the criteria and specifications governing the
kind and quality of such installation.



   (K)   Testing. The City shall be present at tests of component parts
of the collection facilities or distribution facilities for the purpose of
determining that the facilities, as constructed, conform to the City's rules
and regulations regarding such testing. Such tests will be performed only
under the direct supervision of the engineer of record or authorized
inspector. The results of such testing shall be certified by the engineer of
record or authorized inspector. The City shall be notified at least three (3)
working days prior to any inspections or testing performed in accordance with
these regulations. Working days shall be Monday through Friday, excluding
holidays.



   (L)   Transfer of Contributed Property; Bills of Sale.  Each
applicant who has constructed facilities on the applicant's property prior to
interconnection with the existing facilities shall convey such component
facilities as deemed appropriate by the City to the Utilities Department by
bill of sale or other appropriate document in a form satisfactory to the
City. Such transfers of title via bill of sale to the Utilities Department
shall be free of all liens and encumbrances. The City shall not accept and
the applicant shall not transfer any facilities in the category of customer
lines, plumber lines or customer's installation located on the property
owner's side of the point of delivery of service. Such facilities shall
remain the maintenance responsibility of the applicant or subsequent user.
Neither the City nor the Utilities Department shall be required to accept
title to any component part of the facilities as constructed by the applicant
until the Utilities Director has approved the construction of said lines,
verified the inspection of the construction, and accepted the test associated
with the construction of such facilities. The applicant shall maintain
accurate cost records, establishing a construction cost of all water,
wastewater, or reclaimed water facilities and such cost information shall be
furnished to the City concurrently with the bill of sale. The City may refuse
connection and deny the commencement of service to any applicant seeking to
be connected to portions of the facilities installed by the applicant until
such time as provisions of this paragraph have been fully met by the
applicant, or the applicant's successors or assigns.



   (M)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause,
phrase, or portion of this Policy is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall
be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.



   (N)   Mandatory Connection to Palm Bay Utility System Required. 
Mandatory connection to the System is required for all new building
construction where utility mains are within two hundred (200) feet of the
property or if septic tank failure as defined in Rule 10D-6, F.A.C. occurs.
Furthermore, applicable capital charges shall be paid by the property owner
or builder as provided for in § 171.50.  Wastewater service from the System
shall be deemed available if the System is available as that term is defined
in Section 381.0065(2)(a), Florida Statutes (Supp. 1994).

§ 200.14  GUARANTEED REVENUE/RESERVE CAPACITY CHARGE; ADOPTION;
CALCULATION; APPLICABILITY; AND TIME OF PAYMENT.



   (A)   Adoption and Calculation. The City hereby adopts, pursuant to
general law, an annual guaranteed revenue charge equal to twelve (12) times
the monthly residential base facility charge for each purchased water or
wastewater equivalent residential connection not connected to the system.



   (B)   Applicability and Time of Payment.  A Guaranteed
Revenue/Reserve Capacity charge shall be paid annually by all those customers
who have paid water, wastewater, or reclaimed water capital charges or plant
capacity charges to the City and are not yet connected or using said
capacity.  The City may permit installment payments of guaranteed revenue
charges upon such terms and conditions, as the City deems appropriate.  The
base facility charge is set at twelve (12) times the residential base
facility charge. The customer will be billed, in arrears, on an annual basis
twelve (12) months after the effective date a water, wastewater, or reclaimed
water utility agreement is executed for the previous twelve (12) months and
continuing on each annual anniversary date thereof for so long as said
reserved ERC's shall remain unconnected or unused. The right to connect to
the System under any such agreement shall remain valid for no more than ten
(10) years from the date of issuance and only for so long as the said
agreement holder pays the guaranteed revenue charge provided herein.



   (C)   Lapse. The continued reservation of equivalent residential
connections for the water, wastewater, and reclaimed water systems shall be
dependent upon the timely payment of guaranteed revenue fees as set forth
above. The customer will pay all sums due and payable to the City for the
Guaranteed Revenue/ Reserve Capacity charge within fifteen (15) days after
the billing statement has been mailed or presented by the City to the
customer as set forth in such statement. In the event of a lapse of the
remaining reserve capacity or there is a failure or refusal to pay the
amounts due on statements as rendered, the City may, in its sole discretion,
discontinue service.

         (a)   Bulk or industrial water rates different from
those established in subsection (A) above may be established for any customer
or user consuming more than 250,000 gallons per day, average annual basis or
for any customer or user that is a regulated utility or governmental entity
that receives water service through a master meter and owns its own
transmission or distribution system. Such rates will be determined on an
individual basis by the City.



         (b)   Bulk or industrial wastewater rates different from
those established in subsection (A) above may be established for any customer
or user transmitting more than 250,000 gallons per day, average annual basis
or for any customer or user that is a regulated utility or governmental
entity that owns its own transmission system.  Such rates will be determined
on an individual basis by the City.



      (6)   Government.  Connections associated with Federal,
State, and local governments other than the City of Palm Bay.



      (7)   City. Connections associated with the City of Palm Bay.



   (C)   Base Facility Charge. Any customer who requests that service
be interrupted for any length of time will pay the Base Facility Charge
during that period of interruption. Any customer who attempts to circumvent
this charge by closing their account (and requesting deposit refund) at time
of temporary departure and then returning as a new customer will be held
liable for the Base Facility Charge during the disconnected period of time.
The Base Facility Charge shall be set at the prevailing rate established in
subsection (A) above and the payment of which will be made monthly.



   (D)   Seasonal Rate. Any customer who requests that service be
interrupted on a temporary basis exceeding one full month will be charged a

all utility bills no later than 5:00 p.m. on the billing date.



   Late Fee   5% or $5.00 minimum



   (F)   Annual Index Adjustment. The City hereby adopts automatic
annual rate adjustments to apply to all water rates, wastewater rates,
reclaimed water rates, miscellaneous fees and charges, except Main Line
Extension Charges, for utility services as necessary to provide for increases
in expenses due to inflation or other such factors.  This will ensure
adequate net revenues to pay for inflationary increases in operations and
maintenance of the system and to provide all utility-related debt service
coverage requirements of the City. Unless a Certificate of the Consulting
Engineer shall state differently, the adjustment shall be effective as of the
first billing date on or after October 1 of each year and shall be equal to
the then current index pursuant to the Florida Public Service Commission
order establishing the price index for water and wastewater utilities, based
on the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator Index.

St. Johns River Water Management District or other authorities having
jurisdiction declares a water shortage requiring mandatory water use
restrictions or curtailment, the water usage charges established in
subsection (A) above will be increased by a surcharge as appropriate.  The
surcharge will be based upon the recommendation of the City as to the revenue
required to comply with debt service covenants or to meet other requirements
of the water system. The application of the mandatory water restriction
surcharge will require City Council approval prior to becoming effective and
implemented.



   (H)   No Free Service.  No free utility services shall be provided
to any customer.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 201.01  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   (A)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Sewer
Use Code.”



   (B)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for Users of the
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for the City of Palm Bay and enables
the City to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the
Clean Water Act (33 United States Code, Section 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part
403). The objectives of this chapter are:



      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW
that will interfere with its operation;



      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW
that will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters,
or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;



      (3)   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by
wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general
public;



      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater
and sludge from the POTW;



      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of
the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW; and



      (6)   To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is
subject.



   (C)   This chapter shall apply to all Users of the POTW. The chapter
authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater discharge permits; provides
for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes
administrative review procedures; requires User reporting; and provides for
the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from
the program established herein.

GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS



§ 201.20  (RESERVED).



§ 201.21  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   (A)   General Prohibitions.  No User shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes Pass
Through or Interference.  These general prohibitions apply to all Users of
the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical Pretreatment
Standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.



   (B)   Specific Prohibitions.  No User shall introduce or cause to
be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or
wastewater:



      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in
the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup
flashpoint of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140ºF) (sixty
degrees Centigrade (60ºC)) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;



      (2)   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.0,
or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;



      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in Interference but in no case
solids greater than one-half  inch (1/2") or 1.27 centimeters in any
dimension;



      (4)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause
Interference with the POTW;



      (5)   Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150ºF) (fifty-five degrees Centigrade (55ºC)), or
which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
Interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four degrees
Fahrenheit (104ºF) (forty degrees Centigrade (40ºC));



      (6)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or
products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause Interference or
Pass Through;



      (7)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems;



      (8)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Utilities Director in accordance with Section 201.43 of
this chapter;



      (9)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;



      (10)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed
by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the
treatment plant’s effluent, thereby violating the City’s NPDES permit;



      (11)   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes except in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations;



      (12)   Storm Water, surface water, ground water, artesian well

found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405–471.



      (1)   Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed
only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the Utilities Director may impose equivalent concentration or
mass limits in accordance with Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection.



      (2)   When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard
are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Utilities Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users.



      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment
Standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Utilities Director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(e).



      (4)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard in accordance with the following provisions of this
subsection.



         (a)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted
to reflect the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User’s intake water
in accordance with this subsection. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain
credit for intake pollutants must make application to the City. Upon request
of the Industrial User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a
“net” basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the
intake water) if the requirements of Subparagraph (b) below are met.



         (b)   Criteria.



            1.   Either:



               A.   The applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standards contained in 40 CFR Subchapter N specifically provide that they
shall be applied on a net basis; or



               B.   The Industrial User demonstrates that
the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the
Standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.



            2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as BOD,
TSS, and oil and grease should not be granted unless the Industrial User
demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the User’s
effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure
in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on
process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.



            3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent
necessary to meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to
a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be
necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with
Standard(s) adjusted under this subsection.



            4.   Credit shall be granted only if the User
demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as
that into which the POTW discharges. The City may waive this requirement if
it finds that no environmental degradation will result.



      (5)   When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed
only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request
that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination
to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of
the Utilities Director or said representative. The City may establish
equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions
set forth in Subparagraph (a) below:



         (a)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the
Industrial User must:



            1.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ,
water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water
use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;



            2.    Currently use control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for
treatment;



            3.   Provide sufficient information to establish
the facility’s actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based
on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the
facility’s long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily
flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of
current operating conditions;



            4.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels,
or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits
are not appropriate to control the discharge; and



            5.   Have consistently complied with all
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the
Industrial User’s request for equivalent mass limits.



         (b)   An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass
limits must:



            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and
treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent
mass limits;



            2.   Continue to record the facility’s flow
rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;



            3.   Continue to record the facility’s
production rates and notify the Pretreatment Coordinator whenever production
rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent (20%) from its
baseline production rates determined in Paragraph (5)(a)3 of this
subsection.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Pretreatment Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise
the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and



            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable
water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
Paragraph (5)(a)1 of this subsection so long as it discharges under an
equivalent mass limit.



         (c)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the
Utilities Director:



            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by
multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es)
of the IU by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average
Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the
appropriate unit conversion factor;



            2.   Upon notification of a revised production
rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and



            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in
subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the IU’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation
of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily
flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were
not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to
Section 201.26.  The IU must also be in compliance with Section 201.202
regarding the prohibition of bypass.



      (6)   The Utilities Director may convert the mass limits of
the categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual IUs. The conversion is at the discretion of the Utilities
Director. 



      (7)   Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must
comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this subsection in lieu
of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.



      (8)   Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one
limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit
for calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where
such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.



      (9)   Any IU operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard
shall notify the Pretreatment Coordinator within two (2) business days after
the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying
the Pretreatment Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the
original estimate of the long term average production rate.

the Instantaneous Limits for those pollutants which have been established for
the City of Palm Bay’s WWFs using standard procedures, calculations and
methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference,
protection of WWF employees, and adverse effects on wastewater residuals
disposal.  No Industrial User shall discharge process waste streams,
unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the
concentrations set forth by the Director. Local Limits shall be included as
permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. The
established Local Limits are subject to change and shall be modified as
needed. The established Local Limits apply at the point where the wastewater
is discharged to the WWF. The Utilities Director may impose mass limitations
in addition to the concentration-based limitations. A copy of the approved
Local Limits is available upon request at the following location: 250 Osmosis
Drive, Palm Bay, Florida.

§ 201.26  DILUTION.



   No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement.
The Utilities Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using
dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in
other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

operation), this report shall include the User’s actual production during
the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section 201.113(A) of this chapter. All sampling
will be done in conformance with Section 201.110.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.103  PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.



   (A)   All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports
even if they have been designated a NSCIU under the provisions of Paragraph
(3) below.



      (1)   Except as specified in Paragraph (3) below, all SIUs
must, at a frequency determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator submit no
less than twice per year (June 30th and December 31st) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
Pretreatment Standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period.  In cases where the Pretreatment
Standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative,
the User must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment Coordinator
or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the User.



      (2)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section 201.113(A) of this chapter.



      (3)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the
User’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.



      (4)   If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the Pretreatment Coordinator, using the
procedures prescribed in Section 201.110 of this chapter, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.

unless waived by the Utilities Director, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this chapter.



   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of
a discharge described in Subsection (A) above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.



   (D)   SIUs are required to notify the Pretreatment Coordinator
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.

notify the Pretreatment Coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the violation.  The User shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment
Coordinator within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.
Re-sampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs
sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City
performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the User or the City receives the results of this
sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the Industrial User.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.108  NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.



   (A)   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261.  Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the User
discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the User: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of
the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during
the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later
than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under Section 201.104 of this chapter. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by
Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of Sections 201.100, 201.102, and 201.103 of this chapter.



   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
(A), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of  hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  Discharge
of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a
calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
Subsequent months during which the User discharges more than such quantities
of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.



   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the Utilities
Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.



   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
User shall certify that it  has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.



   (E)   This section does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit
issued there under, or any applicable federal or state law.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.109  ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.



   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report  shall be
performed in accordance with the  techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136,
Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and the Department of Environmental Protection
Standard Operating Procedures for Field  Activities,
DEP-SOP-001/01(DEP-SOP-001/01,FS2 400, Wastewater Sampling) and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136, Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and the Department of
Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities,
DEP-SOP-001/01(DEP-SOP-001/01,FS2 400, Wastewater Sampling) does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Pretreatment Coordinator or other parties approved by EPA.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.110  SAMPLE COLLECTION.



   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be
based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative
of conditions occurring during the reporting period.



      (1)   Except as indicated in Paragraphs (2) and (3) below, the
User must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in
the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters
unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.



      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.



      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring
and 90-day compliance reports required in Section 201.100 and 201.102 (40 CFR
403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Utilities
Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section
201.103 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING



§ 201.120  RIGHT OF ENTRY:  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   (A)   The Utilities Director, Pretreatment Coordinator, or
representative shall have the right to enter the premises of any User to
determine whether the User is complying with all requirements of this chapter
and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. 
Users shall allow the Pretreatment Coordinator ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.



      (1)   Where a User has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the User shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Pretreatment Coordinator
shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.



      (2)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall have the right to set
up on the User’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the User’s operations.

install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the User at its own expense.  All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to manufacture’s
specifications to ensure their accuracy.



      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the User at the written or verbal request of the Utilities
Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the User.



      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Pretreatment
Coordinator access to the User’s premises shall be a violation of this
chapter.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.121  SEARCH WARRANTS.



   If the Pretreatment Coordinator has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, the Utilities Director
may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit
Court of Brevard County, Florida.

Requirements’, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS,
fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);



      (3)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement as defined in Subchapter ‘General Sewer Use Requirements’
(daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Utilities Director determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;



      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES



§ 201.140  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.



   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, the Utilities Director may serve upon that User a
written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions,
shall be submitted by the User to the Utilities Director. Submission of such
a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.  Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the Utilities Director to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a Notice of Violation.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.141  CONSENT ORDERS.

compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific
action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 201.143
and 201.144 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.142  SHOW CAUSE HEARING.



   The Utilities Director may order a User which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Utilities Director and show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  Notice shall
be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing.  Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the
User as defined in Section 200.02(B), and required by Section 201.66(A).  A
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the User.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.143  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.



   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, the Utilities Director may issue an order to the
User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into
compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements
to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.144  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.



   (A)   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to
recur, the Utilities Director may issue an order to the User directing it to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:



      (1)    Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.  Issuance of
a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.145  ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.



   (A)   When the Utilities Director finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, the Utilities Director may fine such User in an
amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) a day minimum with a maximum to be
determined by actual recovery cost per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a
per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the
period of violation.



   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty percent (20%) of
the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven
percent (7%) per month. A lien against the User’s property shall be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.



   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Utilities Director to reconsider the fine along with full
payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the
fine. Where a request has merit, the Utilities Director may convene a hearing
on the matter. In the event the User’s appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User.
The Utilities Director may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



   (D)    Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.146  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.



   (A)   The Utilities Director may immediately suspend a User’s
discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears
to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Utilities Director may also immediately suspend a
User’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may
present, an endangerment to the environment.



      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utilities Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Utilities Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the
User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Utilities Director that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Section 201.147 of this chapter are initiated against the User.



      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Utilities Director prior to
the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Section 201.142 or
201.147 of this chapter.



   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension under this section.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.147  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.

chapter, any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:



      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit
conditions;



      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;



      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;



      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the User’s premises
for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or



      (5)   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Subchapter
‘General Sewer Use Requirements’ of this chapter.



   (B)   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 201.142
of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.  Exercise of
this option by the Utilities Director shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement,
the City may petition the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Brevard County
through the City’s attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the User. The City may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 201.200  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless
or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the
requirements of Subsection (C) below, are met.



   (C)   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The User has submitted the following information to the
Utilities Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days):



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical Pretreatment Standards.



   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.201  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   (A)   A User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
Section 201.21(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Sections
201.21(B)(3) through (18) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not
know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference
and that either:



      (1)   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and
the User was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
Pass Through or Interference; or



      (2)   No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User’s prior discharge
when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.



(Ord. 2013-15, passed 2-21-13)



§ 201.202  BYPASS.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section:



      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestream
from any portion of a User's treatment facility.



      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of Subsections (C) and (D) of this section.



   (C)   Bypass Notifications.



      (1)   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Utilities Director, at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.



      (2)   A User shall submit oral notice to the Utilities
Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment
Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of
the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and stepstaken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Utilities Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.



   (D)   Bypass.



      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utilities Director may
take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:



         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;



         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         (c)   The User submitted notices as required under
Subsection (C) of this section.



      (2)   The Utilities Director may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Utilities Director
determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in Paragraph (1)
above.
