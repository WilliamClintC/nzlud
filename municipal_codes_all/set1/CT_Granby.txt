PREFACE
The Town of Granby has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change common
to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of
the establishment of the Town, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity
of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function
and government of the Town. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history,
and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of
new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is
an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological
enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged
for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that
the Board of Selectmen ordered the following codification of the Town's legislation.
Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and
permanent nature enacted by the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Granby, including revisions
or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the Board of Selectmen in the course
of the codification.
Division of Code
The Code is divided into parts. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all Town legislation
of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of government, that establishing
or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the
municipal government and its departments. Part II, General Legislation, contains all other Town
legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for
violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do not.
Table of Contents and
Grouping of Legislation
The Table of Contents details the arrangement of material alphabetically by chapter as a means of
identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been
combined by the editor into a single chapter, the use of article designations has preserved the
identity of the individual enactments, and the titles of the articles are listed beneath the chapter
title in order to facilitate location of the individual enactments.
Reserved Chapters
Unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the Table of Contents but are available for assignment
to new enactments. In this manner, new subject matter can be included alphabetically.
GRANBY CODE
ii 07 - 01 - 2017
Pagination
A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous
unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral
“1.” Thus, Chapter 6 would begin on page 6:1. By use of this system, it is possible to add
or to change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the sequence of subsequent
pages.
Numbering of Sections
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed in which the section number indicates
the number of the chapter and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section
of Chapter 30 would be § 30-1, while the sixth section of Chapter 57 would be § 57-6.
Scheme
The scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully
written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the
chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision
of reference, the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.
Histories
At the end of the Scheme (list of section titles) in each chapter is located the legislative history
for that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was
derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number,
resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing
parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of each part or
article is indicated in the text, under its title. Amendments to individual sections or subsections
are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.
General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General
References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's Notes are
used in the text to provide supplementary information and cross-references to related provisions
in other chapters.
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of
the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions
are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this publication is reserved
for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include.
PREFACE

Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation, indicating its inclusion in the publication
or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement
to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this publication will be used by persons
without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate
a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The Index will be
supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added.
Instructions for Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or additions, should be adopted
as amendments to the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively altered
should not be renumbered.
Adding new sections. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at
the end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing
sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between §§ 65-5 and 65-6 should be designated
§ 65-5.1).
Adding new chapters. New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in
the appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation),
utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word
for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles,
Abandoned" under "V" in the Table of Contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement
devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under
"A" in the Table of Contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should
be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 166 and 167 should be designated
Chapter 166A).
Adding new articles. New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g.,
adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to
be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA). The section
numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA contains six sections and
existing Article XVI ends with § 166-30 and Article XVII begins with § 166-31, Article XVIA
should contain §§ 166-30.1 through 166-30.6).

Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation or
amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible
after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old
pages removed, in accordance with the Instruction Page which accompanies each supplement.
Acknowledgment
The assistance of the Town officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The codification
of the legislation of the Town of Granby reflects an appreciation of the needs of a progressive and
expanding community. As in many other municipalities, officials are faced with fundamental
changes involving nearly every facet of community life. Problems increase in number and complexity
and range in importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning. It is the
profound conviction of General Code that this publication will contribute significantly to the efficient
administration of local government. As Samuel Johnson observed, "The law is the last result
of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the benefit of the public."

Streets and sidewalks — See Ch. 150.
§ 133-1. Purpose.
The scenic and rural roads of the Town of Granby are irreplaceable resources. It is the
purpose of this chapter to balance the need to provide for convenient and safe public
transportation routes with the need to preserve these scenic and rural roads. Therefore, be
it ordained by the Town of Granby that, pursuant to the authority granted by Connecticut
General Statues, § 7-149a, the Town of Granby shall provide for the designation of
certain Town highways or portions thereof within its borders as scenic roads.
§ 133-2. Authority to designate.
The Planning and Zoning Commission is hereby authorized to designate any Town public
highway or any portion of any Town public highway ("road") as a scenic road ("scenic
road") in accordance with the procedures in this chapter.
§ 133-3. Designation criteria.
A. No road or portion of road shall be designated as a scenic road unless it is free of
intensive commercial development and intensive vehicular traffic and unless it has
a minimum length of 2,500 feet, except that the length of the road may be less if the
Commission finds that the road segment contains unique scenic features and/or is
located between identifiable environmental features and/or road intersections.
B. Prior to designating a road as a scenic road, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall first specifically find that at least one of the following criteria is met:
(1) The highway is unpaved;
(2) The highway is bordered by mature trees or stone walls;
(3) The traveled portion of the highway is no more than 20 feet in width;
(4) The highway offers scenic views;
(5) The highway blends naturally into the surrounding terrain;
(6) The highway parallels or crosses over brooks, streams, lakes or ponds.
C. Aside from these criteria, the Planning and Zoning Commission may give
consideration to the following, including without limitation:
(1) Buildings, structures or places of historical significance;
(2) Recreational uses;
(3) Proximity to open space, agricultural, forest lands, including land that is
public nonprofit or privately owned;
(4) Notable geologic or other natural features which would benefit from a road's
designation as a scenic road.
D. No road may be designated as a scenic road by the Planning and Zoning
Commission unless the owners of the majority of the lot frontage abutting the
portion of the road proposed for such designation agree to its designation as a
scenic road by filing a written statement of approval with the Town Clerk of the
Town of Granby, which statement of approval shall meet the requirements of § 133-
4 of this chapter.
§ 133-4. Application procedure.
A. Request for designation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider a
road for designation as a scenic road upon receipt of a request for designation and
may itself initiate such a request, as herein described. No road shall be designated
as a scenic road by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless a request for
designation has been filed with the Commission on a form prescribed by it,
containing the following information:
(1) The name of the road proposed to be designated as a scenic road and a general
description of the road or portion of it to be designated, which includes the
total frontage of the road section proposed, and the names and addresses of all
abutters. The above information shall be shown on a plan at a minimum scale
of one inch equals 200 feet, showing the limits of the proposed designated
section of the road.
(2) A written description identifying those characteristics of the road which
qualify it for scenic road status, including as a minimum but not limited to the
criteria set forth in § 133-3 of this chapter.
(3) A copy of a statement of approval signed by the owners of a majority of lot
frontage abutting the proposed scenic road stating that they consent to its
designation as a scenic road. The statement of approval shall include their
names and addresses and the measured lot frontage of each along the proposed
scenic road. The statement of approval shall be in a form prescribed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and the original of it shall be filed with the
Town Clerk at the same time as the copy is filed with the Planning and Zoning
Commission as part of the request for designation. Where the Planning and
Zoning Commission itself initiates a request for designation, it may waive the
requirement that the written statement of approval accompany the request;
provided, however, that no designation of a scenic highway shall be effective
unless the written statement of approval executed by the requisite number of
owners is filed with the Town Clerk and the Commission within such time
period as the Commission shall specify.
B. Hearing and decisions. Before designating a road as a scenic road, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with § 133-6.
C. Rescission. The Planning and Zoning Commission may rescind the designation of a
road as a scenic road in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 133-6,
provided that the owners of a majority of the lot frontage abutting the scenic road
concur with such rescission and have filed with the Town Clerk a written statement
of approval of rescission, which shall include their names and addresses and the
measured lot frontage of each along the scenic road. A copy of said written
statement of approval of rescission shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning
Commission at the same time as it is filed with the Town Clerk. No designation of a
road as a scenic road may be rescinded, and no statement of approval of rescission
may be filed, for at least two years after the effective date of the designation of a
scenic road.
§ 133-5. Maintenance, alteration and reconstruction.
A. Preservation objective. The Town shall maintain its scenic roads in good and
sufficient repair and in a safe, passable condition, pursuant to its regular schedule
for maintenance of Town roads. Routine maintenance, alteration and reconstruction
of a scenic road shall be carried out so as to preserve to the highest degree possible
its scenic and rural characteristics, compatible with safe road operations. In the case
of natural disaster in which a scenic road becomes impassable or unsafe for public
travel, emergency repairs may be made only to the extent needed to restore the
scenic road to its preemergency condition.
B. Routine road maintenance. Routine road maintenance shall include the removal of
dead trees, the trimming of tree branches that encroach on the traveled portion of
the scenic road below the height needed to allow school buses, road maintenance
vehicles and emergency vehicles to pass, the trimming or removal of brush and the
removal of boulders or other obstacles that encroach on the traveled portion of the
scenic road or block safe sight distance, the necessary trimming for utility lines, the
trimming of brush to enhance and protect scenic views, stone walls, mature trees
and other characteristics of the scenic road set forth in the decision designating it as
a scenic road, the correction of drainage problems, provided that such measures
would not otherwise be considered alteration or improvements, the regraveling of
scenic roads having gravel surfaces and the resurfacing, restoration and repair of
existing paved roadway surfaces. The Town Engineer shall monitor routine road
maintenance of scenic roads to ensure compliance with this chapter.
C. Definitions.
(1) As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ALTERATION OF A SCENIC ROAD — All repairs or improvements, other than
routine road maintenance as described in Subsection B above, or repairs made necessary
by a natural disaster, as described in Subsection A above, and shall include any widening
or straightening of the right-of-way, any widening, straightening or change of grade of
the traveled portion of the scenic road, the paving of a scenic road having gravel surface,
the removal of stone walls, the removal of mature trees, the regrading of roadside slopes
and all other similar improvements.
RECONSTRUCTION OF A SCENIC ROAD — The complete removal of the road
surface and/or subsurface for the purposes of reconstructing the scenic road in its entirety,
including recycling methods and any extension of the width of the scenic road.
(2) Any alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road shall be
made in accordance with the following procedures.
D. Procedures.
(1) The Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the
requirements of § 133-6 on any proposal for the alteration or reconstruction of
a scenic road, even where the proposal is part of a zoning or subdivision
application for which no public hearing is otherwise required. Upon the filing
of such a proposal with the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
Commission shall ask the Director of Community Development and the Town
Engineer each to submit a report of their views on the proposal and shall
consider each report in the process of making the decision. If the decision of
the Planning and Zoning Commission is anything other than approval of the
proposal as submitted by the public agency, the public agency may, within 15
days after the decision has been published in a newspaper having general
circulation in the Town, file an appeal, in writing, with the Board of
Selectmen. The Board shall thereafter review the record before the Planning
and Zoning Commission, including the public agency proposal, the
Commission decision and the reasons for the decision as stated in the record
and, within 30 days after filing of the appeal with it, shall render its decision
either affirming, modifying and affirming or overruling and setting aside the
decision of the Commission.
(2) The Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the
requirements of § 133-6 for any zoning or subdivision application which
includes proposals for the alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a
scenic road as part of the application. The process and timing of both requests
shall be conducted simultaneously. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may require the applicant to submit engineering or other technical reports
documenting a need for the alteration or reconstruction and evaluating
potential alternative solutions. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
evaluate both the subdivision road standards and the scenic values when
considering the application.
(3) Proposals for alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road
made by a private applicant, other than those for a subdivision having a public
hearing, shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
approval, and the Commission shall approve, modify and approve or
disapprove any proposal after a public hearing conducted in accordance with
the requirements of § 133-6. If it deems it necessary, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require the applicant to submit engineering or other
technical reports documenting a need for the alteration or reconstruction and
evaluating potential alternative solutions. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall evaluate both the subdivision highway standards and the
scenic values in considering such proposals for alteration or reconstruction.
E. Standards for alteration or reconstruction.
(1) No alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road (see
Subsection C) shall be made unless the Planning and Zoning Commission
determines that such alteration or reconstruction is necessary to maintain the
scenic road in good and sufficient repair and in safe condition for public
travel.
(2) In determining whether to allow the proposed alteration of a scenic road or
reconstruction of a scenic road, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
take into account the specific safety features of the proposed change and the
overall impact of the proposed change. Any decision by the Planning and
Zoning Commission to permit an alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction
of a scenic road shall reflect the least possible damage to the character of the
scenic road. If an alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road
is approved, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall specify the following
requirements as they relate to scenic values:
(a) Curves. Curves shall not be eliminated unless they are found to be a
hazard.
(b) Grades. Hills and valleys shall not be destroyed by cuts and fills unless
absolutely essential for road safety.
(c) Widths. A scenic road should only be widened if the Planning and
Zoning Commission finds that the amount of traffic, safe road
operations and maintenance needs require such widening. For some rural
roads, the amount of traffic that can be handled can be greatly increased
by wide bypasses and turnouts, constructed at intervals where they do
the least damage to scenic and other values.
(d) Side slopes. The existing steepness of side slopes is preferable to the
reduction of gradient by extensive removal of soil and rock. This is
especially true where the slope is fully stabilized and where it is rich
with existing ground cover, shrubs and trees.
(e) Vistas. Vistas of distinct landscapes shall be preserved by suitable
vegetation management techniques.
(f) Vegetation. Vegetation on the side of the scenic road shall be managed
in such a way as to preserve wild flowers, shrubs of ornamental and
wildlife values, trees, overarching isolated trees and trees forming a
canopy.
(g) Stone walls. If stone walls or portions thereof must be removed, they
shall be rebuilt along the affected portion of the scenic road.
(3) The Planning and Zoning Commission shall assure itself that suitable
vegetation management techniques are employed to preserve any tree canopy,
shrubs and other vegetation, consistent with the need for clearances for utility
lines.
(4) The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not grant an application for
alteration or reconstruction of a scenic road to accommodate a proposed
subdivision or other development of land to which the scenic road would
provide access unless the Commission determines that such alteration or
reconstruction will not have a material adverse effect on the characteristics of
the scenic road which formed the basis for its designation as a scenic road.
(5) Reconstruction criteria. No scenic road may be reconstructed beyond that
permitted in accordance with the provisions of § 133-5 of this chapter, unless
the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that there is no reasonable
alternative to the improvement or alteration of the scenic road other than such
reconstruction. Such finding shall be based upon approved road construction
and safety standards and a finding that the alteration or reconstruction is
necessary to maintain the scenic road in good and sufficient repair and in a
safe condition for travel in accordance with provisions of this section. Before
any alteration or reconstruction may be made to a scenic road pursuant to this
section, all other requirements and procedures of § 133-6 of this chapter must
be complied with.
(6) Rights of landowners.
(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit a person owning or
occupying land abutting the scenic road from maintaining and repairing
the land which abuts the scenic road if the activity is outside of the rightof-
way of the scenic road. No person shall be denied access to his or her
property by driveway or subdivision road, provided that the connection
to the scenic road is designed and constructed to safeguard the basis for
a scenic road as recorded by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(b) Nothing herein shall prohibit a landowner from permanently removing a
portion of a stone wall in order to construct or improve a driveway, or in
the case of a subdivision, to connect a subdivision road with a
designated scenic road, but these activities must be consistent with these
guidelines and are subject to approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
§ 133-6. Administration.
A. Public hearings. A request for designation, a request for rescission of designation, a
proposal for alteration of a scenic road and a proposal for reconstruction of a scenic
road shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall commence a public hearing within 65 days after receipt
of such request or proposal of an application prepared in accordance with this
chapter, and said hearing shall be completed within 30 days after such hearing
commences. The applicant or the Commission may consent to one or more
extensions of any period specified in this section, provided that the total extension
of any such period shall not be for longer than the original period as specified in
this section, or the applicant may withdraw such application. For the purposes of
this section, the day of receipt of a request or proposal shall be the day of the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission immediately
following the day of submission to the Planning and Zoning Commission or 35
days after such submission, whichever is sooner. Notice of the time and place of
such public hearing shall be published at least twice in a newspaper having a
substantial circulation in the Town at intervals of not less than two days, the first
not more than 15 days or less than 10 days, and the last not less than two days
before the day of such hearing. At such hearing, any person may appear in person
and may be represented by agent or by an attorney.
B. Decision. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall render its decision on any
request or proposal made under Subsection A within 65 days after closing the
hearing. The applicant may consent to one or more extensions of this period,
provided that the total extension shall not be for longer than 65 days. Within 15
days after the date the Commission rendered its decision, the decision shall be
published in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town, and notice of such
decision shall be sent by certified mail to the owners of the lots fronting on that
road designated as a scenic road. Such notice shall include a statement of a
decision, together with the date of such action and the reasons for the decision as
stated in the records of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Notice of the
decision and the reasons for the decision shall be forwarded to Public Works and to
all utility companies which service the area affected by the application within 15
days after acting.
§ 133-7. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by a designation of a highway or portion of a highway by the
Planning and Zoning Commission as a scenic road pursuant to this chapter may appeal
such designation in the manner and utilizing the same standard of review provided for
appeals from the decisions of the Planning and Zoning Commission under Connecticut
General Statutes, § 8-8, as the same may be amended from time to time.

§ 138-27. Discharge of deleterious substances.
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged into the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in § 138-26 of this article, and which in the judgment of the Water
Pollution Control Authority may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitutes a public nuisance, the Water Pollution Control Authority may:
(1) Reject the wastes;
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public
sewers;
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes
not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of § 138-
32 of this article.
B. If the Water Pollution Control Authority permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Water Pollution Control Authority.
§ 138-28. Interceptors.

of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the
effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property.
§ 138-32. Special arrangements.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the Water Pollution Control Authority and any
industrial concern whereby any compatible industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Water Pollution Control Authority for treatment,
subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern, and further provided that in the
judgment of the Water Pollution Control Authority such compatible waste will not
unduly tax the sewage treatment facilities.

time to time as he deems proper, but such rules shall not be inconsistent with this
article. Any such procedure, however, must first be approved by the Town
Manager.
§ 144-19. Responsibilities and obligations of refuse collectors. 9
A. Place of delivery, payment. Each refuse collector shall deliver all solid waste
meeting the contractual standards collected within the territorial limits of the Town

The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause,
sentence, or paragraph of this chapter or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or
circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or
application of this chapter.
§ 146-6. Ultimate responsibility.
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards;
therefore, this chapter does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that
there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
§ 146-7. Discharge and illicit connection prohibitions; exemptions.
A. Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into
the storm drainage system any materials, including but not limited to, pollutants or waters
containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
A. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drainage
system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this
chapter: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or
lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to
storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not
including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air
conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural
riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated, typically less
than one ppm chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not
containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the Town Manager as being necessary to protect
public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a written notification to the Town
Manager prior to the time of the test. Said written notification may be in the form of
electronic mail, facsimile transmission or hard copy letter format.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an
NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and
administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency,
provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit,
waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the
storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the
past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or allows such a connection to
continue.
§ 146-8. Suspension of (MS4) storm drainage system access.
A. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Town Manager may,
without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Town
Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
storm drainage system or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the storm
drainage system in violation of this chapter may have their storm drainage system access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town
Manager will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its storm drainage system
access. The violator may petition the Town Manager for reconsideration and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates storm drainage system access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the Town
Manager.
§ 146-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit
shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be
required in a form acceptable to the Town Manager prior to the allowing of discharges to the
storm drainage system.
§ 146-10. Right of entry, evaluation, and monitoring of damages.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges
associated with industrial or construction activity, and any other commercial or residential
facilities that discharge stormwater to the storm drainage system.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Town Manager shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance
with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives or designees of the
Town Manager.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Town Manager ready access to all parts of the
facility for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records
that must be kept under the conditions of a town, state or federal NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by
state and federal law.
(3) The Town Manager shall have the right to set up on any NPDES permitted facilities
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Town Manager to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Town Manager has the right to require the installation of sampling and
monitoring equipment on any NPDES permitted facility by the discharger at its own
expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure
their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or
oral request of the Town Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town Manager access to a permitted facility is a
violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the
operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the Town Manager
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
(7) If the Town Manager has been refused access to any part of the facility from which
stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Town Manager may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(8) While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in Subsection
B(1) through (5) of this section, the Town Manager shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the facility.
§ 146-11. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best
management practices.
The Town Manager will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any
activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of
a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the storm
drainage system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or facility, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the storm drainage
system as directed by the Town Manager. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial or construction
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 146-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not
become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 146-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or
operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of
any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or water of the
United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the Town
Manager in person or by phone, electronic mail or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the Town Manager within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 146-14. Enforcement; notice of violation; fines.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) Whenever the Town Manager finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed
to meet a requirement of this chapter, he/she shall order compliance by written notice
of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(b) The elimination of illicit discharges or connections;
(c) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
(d) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards
and the restoration of any affected property; and
(e) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property are required, the
notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be
completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate
or restore within the established deadline, the Town Manager may order the work be
done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the violator fined an
amount equal to the expense thereof in addition to any fines imposed in Subsections
B or C of this section.
B. Procedure for issuance of citations.
(1) The Town Manager shall issue a written notice to any person who violates any
provision of this chapter. No written notice may be issued against the state or any
state official or state employee acting within the scope of his/her employment. Such
written notice shall explain the nature of the violation and the steps required for
compliance, and shall allow a seventy-two-hour period within which to correct the
violation or within which a written plan for correction shall be submitted to the Town
Manager, setting forth a reasonable time period for correction of the violation as
agreed upon by the Town Manager. A written notice issued pursuant to this
subsection shall be served: by hand delivery, at which time the seventy-two-hour
period shall begin; or by certified mail return receipt requested and by regular
first-class mail. Three business days shall be allowed for mail delivery of the notice
prior to the commencement of the seventy-two-hour period.
(2) Within two business days after the period for correction established in Subsection A
expires, the Town Manager shall reinspect the subject property to determine
compliance.
(3) If the violations set forth in the written notice have not been corrected at the time of
reinspection, the Town Manager, in his/her capacity as chief executive officer, may
issue a citation and fine of up to $100 for each violation by hand, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, by leaving a true and attested copy of the citation at the usual
place of abode or residence of the person in violation, or in the case of a corporate or
business entity, delivery to the business address or the address of the statutory agent
of said entity. No such fine shall be levied against the state or any state official or
state employee acting within the scope of his/her employment. All citations issued
pursuant to this section shall state the violation for which the citation is being issued,
the fine imposed for the violation, the time period within which the fine must be paid,
and an address for remittance of the fine.
C. Compliance periods after citation.
(1) Any violation for which a citation is issued and which is not corrected within the time
period specified in Subsection B of this section shall be a new violation of this
chapter, and every twenty-four-hour period thereafter in which the violation is not
corrected shall constitute a new violation. The citation shall include a notice to the
alleged violator that each twenty-four-hour period of noncompliance after the time
period specified in § 146-14B shall constitute a new violation and a new fine of up to
$100.
(2) The Town Manager shall not be responsible for a daily reinspection. Rather, the
person to whom the citation has been issued shall be responsible for reporting
subsequent compliance by way of written report to the Town Manager. The Town
Manager shall reinspect to confirm compliance within one business day of receipt of
such report.
D. Payment of fines.
(1) All fines imposed under this chapter which are uncontested shall be made payable to
the Town of Granby and shall be received by the Town Manager within 14 calendar
days from date of notice of the citation. All fines collected by the Town Manager
shall be deposited into the Town of Granby general fund.

notice of action and a statement of the right to an appeal to the facility operator or facility
owner.
B. The facility operator or facility owner may appeal a notice of violation to the Town
Manager by setting forth, in writing, the reasons for the appeal within 10 calendar days
after date of the notice of violation.
C. The facility operator or facility owner may appeal the decision of the Town Manager to the
hearing officer as follows:
(1) The facility operator or facility owner may file a written request for a review by
paying an appeal fee of $25 and setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 10
calendar days after the date of notification of the decision from the Town Manager.
Appeal fees shall be returned to the appealing facility operator or facility owner if the
appeal is upheld.
(2) The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar
days after the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be informal in nature. The
person requesting the hearing may testify concerning the facts, circumstances and
nature of his/her appeal and may present supporting documentation.
(3) The hearing officer shall render a written decision within 15 calendar days of the
hearing. The decision will affirm or reverse the decision of the Town Manager.
D. The filing of a request for appeal shall stay the action by the Town Manager requiring
payment of a surcharge until the hearing officer has completed his/her review. If a request
for appeal is not made within the 10 calendar day period, the action of the Town Manager
is final.
§ 146-16. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the
requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this
chapter, the Town Manager may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining
the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 146-17. Compensatory action.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this chapter, the Town
Manager may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain
stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, watershed cleanup, or other related activities.
§ 146-18. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or
permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health,
safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or
restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 146-19. Criminal prosecution.
Any person that has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall be liable to criminal
prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The Town Manager may recover all attorneys' fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including sampling
and monitoring expenses.
§ 146-20. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any
applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the Town Manager to seek
cumulative remedies.

ARTICLE I
Exemption for Elderly and Disabled Persons
[Adopted 11-16-1987; amended in its entirety 4-15-1991]
§ 156-1. Purpose. 1
The purpose of this article is to provide property tax relief for residence property of the
elderly and totally disabled to supplement the amount provided by the State of
Connecticut in accordance with C.G.S. §§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and §§ 12-
170aa to 12-170cc, inclusive.
§ 156-2. Qualifications.
Any person who owns real property located in the Town of Granby or who is liable for
the payment of taxes thereon under C.G.S. § 12-48 and occupies that property as his or
her principal residence shall be entitled to tax relief in accordance with this article,
provided:
A. Age or disability requirement.
(1) Such person is 65 years of age or over; or whose spouse, living with him or
her, is 65 years of age or over; or who is 60 years of age or over and the
surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified for relief under this article at the time
of his or her death; or
(2) Such person is under 65 years of age and eligible in accordance with
applicable federal regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits
under social security; or has not been engaged in employment covered by
social security and accordingly has not qualified for benefits thereunder, but
has become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal,
state or local government retirement or disability plan, including the Railroad
Retirement Act and any government-related teachers' retirement plan, in
which requirements with respect to qualifications for such permanent total
disability benefits are comparable to such requirements under social security.
1. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
B. Such person or spouse has been a real property taxpayer of Granby for one year
immediately preceding the receipt of tax benefits.
C. The property for which tax relief is claimed is the principal residence of such
person.
§ 156-3. Application.
A. An application must be filed with the Granby Assessor annually not earlier than
February 15 or later than May 15 to obtain property tax relief under this article for
taxes assessed on the list of October 1 of the preceding calendar year.
B. Prior to filing an application in accordance with this article, an application for tax
relief under any state statute for which such person is eligible must be filed. If such
person is not eligible for tax relief under any state statute, he or she must certify his
or her ineligibility, under oath, on a form acceptable to the Assessor.
§ 156-4. Form and amount of tax relief.
A. The amount of tax relief granted hereunder shall be that percentage of the tax due
corresponding to the applicable qualifying income shown on the schedule hereto
attached and incorporated herein. "Qualifying income" means total adjusted gross
income for purposes of the federal income tax plus any other income not included
in such adjusted gross income in the calendar year ending immediately preceding
the date of the application for benefits under this article, except that, for any
taxpayer born before 1910 who had qualified for the state Freeze Program but has
been disqualified therefrom, "qualifying income" shall mean total taxable income
for purposes of the federal income tax plus any other income not included in such
taxable income in such calendar year. The amounts of qualifying income shown on
the schedule hereto attached and incorporated herein shall be adjusted annually in a
uniform manner to reflect the annual inflation adjustment in social security income
as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management pursuant to
C.G.S. § 12-170aa(b)(2).
B. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no tax relief under this article
shall be in an amount which, combined with any tax relief for which the taxpayer
may be eligible in accordance with C.G.S. §§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and
12-170aa, exceeds in the aggregate 75% of the property tax for which such taxpayer
would be liable but for the benefits under this article and any of the foregoing
sections of the Connecticut General Statutes.2
§ 156-5. Death of taxpayer.
A. If any person entitled to the tax credit pursuant to this article dies prior to June 15,
unless his or her spouse is otherwise qualified, no tax credit shall be given for the
next fiscal year. If such person dies on or after June 15, the tax credit for which
such person applied prior to this death shall be granted, but no additional tax credit
2. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
shall be allowed for his or her interest in the property for any fiscal years thereafter,
unless his or her spouse is otherwise qualified.
B. If any person entitled to the tax credit pursuant to this article sells the property on
which the tax credit is granted, no additional tax credit shall be allowed for his or
her interest in the property for any fiscal years commencing after the date of the
sale of the property, and provided further that the purchaser of such property shall
pay the Town a prorated share of the tax credit as provided by § 12-81a of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 156-6. Deferral as further relief for certain taxpayers.
A. In addition to tax relief under § 156-4 of this article, a person qualified under § 156-
2 of this article who has owned and occupied the property for which the tax relief is
claimed as his or her residence for a minimum continuous period of five years
preceding the date of his or her application in accordance with § 156-3 of this
article, may be granted a deferral of the payment of that portion of the tax levied
against the property calculated in accordance with Subsection B hereof until the
earlier of his or her death or the sale or transfer of the property except as otherwise
provided in Subsection C hereof. Taxes so deferred, together with interest at the
rate of 0.75% per month shall constitute a lien on the property until such deferred
taxes become due. Interest on such taxes once due until they are paid shall be at the
rate provided in the General Statutes for interest on delinquent municipal real
property taxes generally.
B. The amount of tax which may be deferred hereunder is that amount due from the
taxpayer which exceeds the amount due from the taxpayer on the assessment list
immediately preceding the assessment list on which he or she first qualified for
relief hereunder except that no taxes deferred hereunder shall be in an amount
which, combined with any tax relief for which the taxpayer may be eligible in
accordance with C.G.S. §§ 1-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and 12 170aa, and § 156-4
of this article, exceeds in the aggregate 75% of the property tax for which such
taxpayer would be liable but for the benefits under this article and any of the
foregoing sections of the Connecticut General Statutes.3
C. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the failure of the taxpayer to
pay any taxes actually due when they are required to be paid shall render all taxes
deferred hereunder, together with interest thereon, immediately due and payable.
D. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no taxpayer whose qualifying
income, as defined in § 156-4 of this article, is 15 times the actual taxes due from
him or her or more in any year shall be eligible for the deferral of any taxes in that
year.

purposes.
§ 156-8. Procedure for obtaining exemption.
A. Any owner of any such motor vehicle used for the purposes stated above shall apply
to the Assessor's Office of the Town of Granby for such personal property tax
exemption. The Assessor's Office shall determine whether or not said motor vehicle
has been adapted and/or modified and that it will be used exclusively for the

eligible to receive an exemption of municipal taxes, as described in § 156-12 below,
when he or she meets the following criteria:
(1) The member must not receive any remuneration, other than incidental
payments or reimbursement of lost wages if called to court, from the Town for
his or her service with the LAFD or GAA;
(2) The member must have completed one year of continuous service with the
LAFD or GAA on or before October 1 of a given year in order to be eligible
for a tax exemption on July 1 of the next following year; and
(3) The member must be certified by the Chief of the LAFD or President of the
GAA to have met criteria defined by that organization as defined in § 156-11
below.
B. The criteria defined by each organization shall be reviewed and approved by the
Board of Selectmen prior to implementation. Any changes in the criteria shall
likewise require Board of Selectmen approval before implementation. Criteria will
be placed on file as a matter of public record in the office of the Granby Town
Clerk. Said criteria are subject to annual change in accordance with § 156-10B.6
§ 156-11. Certification.
A. On or before October 1 of each year, the Chief of the LAFD and the President of
the GAA shall submit to the Assessor a list of the members of their respective
organizations who are eligible as defined in § 156-10 above. This list shall include
the address of each individual and the amount, as determined from the schedule in §
156-12 below, for which the member is eligible.
B. The Chief of the LAFD and President of GAA shall cause such records as may be
required by the Town to be maintained in order to verify members' eligibility.
These records shall be available at any time during normal business hours for audit
by Town staff or by persons employed by the Town for that purpose.
§ 156-12. Exemption benefit and schedule.
Exemption of municipally levied real property and motor vehicle taxes ("property taxes")
for which the eligible member may be liable shall be granted to eligible members of the
LAFD and GAA on October 1 of the year following their certification of eligibility, as
defined in § 156-11 above, according to the following:
6. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
A. Maximum benefit. The maximum benefit shall be defined as an exemption
applicable to the assessed value of real or personal property up to an amount equal
to the quotient of $1,000,000 divided by the Town's mill rate in effect at the time of
the assessment, expressed as a whole number of dollars per $1,000 of assessed
value. The maximum benefit amount may not exceed $1,000.
B. Benefit schedule.
(1) An eligible member shall receive the maximum benefit, as defined above;
provided, however, that no member will be entitled to an exemption of more
than the total property taxes for which he or she is liable to the Town of
Granby.
(2) The amount listed above may be modified as described under §§ 156-14 and
156-17 below.
§ 156-13. Retirement benefit.
A member who has served a minimum of 20 years on active duty with either the LAFD
or GAA and has left the organization in good standing after the effective date of this
article shall be eligible to continue to receive the maximum benefit, as defined in § 156-
12, annually for as long as he or she owns property subject to property tax in Granby and
is a resident thereof. The benefit shall end at the earlier of the death of the member or the
transfer of all property subject to such tax. In order to qualify for this benefit a member
must complete a minimum of two years' active service after the effective date of this

both the LAFD and GAA will not receive full separate exemptions for service in both
organizations.
§ 156-15. Years of service.
To be eligible for exemption as described in this article, a member of the LAFD or GAA
must serve continuously for the designated period outlined in § 156-12 above. Years of
service shall not be deemed to be interrupted if LAFD or GAA grants medical leave, or
military service leave with the United States, or by periods of absence for disability for
which LAFD or GAA workers' compensation benefits are paid. Otherwise, when a
person has served as a volunteer with LAFD or GAA, left such service and then returned,
he or she shall not be eligible for exemption until he or she has completed one full fiscal
year of service. Upon his or her completion of this year's service, his or her total years of
service shall then be deemed to include the total number of years previously served plus
the one year.
§ 156-16. Application and record of exemption.
A. The exemption under this article shall be applied first to any real property owned by
the eligible member and taxable in the Town of Granby and then against any motor
vehicles so owned and taxable.
B. The exemption under this article shall be applicable for any real property or motor
vehicle of an LAFD or GAA volunteer eligible for such exemption whether such
property is owned individually, jointly, or as tenant in common with one or more
other persons; provided, however, that the maximum benefit may not exceed the
volunteer's proportionate share of tax.
C. The Assessor for the Town of Granby is delegated the authority to administer this
program and promulgate such forms, rules and regulations consistent with this
article and applicable state statutes.

Pursuant to the authority of C.G.S. § 12-81f, any veteran entitled to an exemption from
property tax in accordance with Subdivision 19 of C.G.S. § 12-81 and any veteran's
surviving spouse entitled to an exemption from property tax in accordance with
Subdivision 22 of C.G.S. § 12-81 shall be entitled to an additional exemption of $10,000
applicable to the assessed value of property, provided such veteran's or such surviving
spouse's qualifying income does not exceed the applicable maximum amount as provided
under C.G.S. § 12-81l.
§ 156-20. Application.
Any such veteran or spouse submitting a claim for such additional exemption from
property tax shall be required to file an application on a form prepared for such purpose
by the Assessor by not later than the assessment date with respect to which such
additional exemption is claimed, provided when an applicant has filed for such
exemption and received approval for the first time, such applicant shall be required to file
for such exemption biennially thereafter, subject to the provisions of § 156-21 below.
Each such application shall include a copy of such veteran's or spouse's federal income
tax return, or, in the event such return is not filed, such evidence relating to income as
may be required by the Assessor, for the tax year of such veteran or spouse ending
immediately prior to the assessment date with respect to which such additional exemption
is claimed.
§ 156-21. Presumption of qualification; duty to report disqualification.
Any person who has submitted an application and been approved in any year for the

following such approval, the Assessor shall notify, in writing, each person presumed to
be qualified pursuant to this section. If such person has qualifying income in excess of the
maximum allowed under § 156-19 above, such person shall notify the Assessor on or

reapplied and again qualified for such exemption. Any person who fails to notify the
Assessor of such disqualification shall make payment to the Town in the amount of the
property tax loss related to the exemption improperly taken. The failure of the Assessor
to provide the written notice herein required or the failure of such person to have received
such notice shall not operate to excuse such person from the obligation to report the
disqualification as required herein or to pay to the Town the amount of the tax loss
related to the exemption for which such person was disqualified.

This article shall take effect for the assessment year commencing October 1, 2004, and

3.9 	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ED 
3.9.0 	Introduction 
3.9.0 	The Economic Development Zone (ED) is comprised of over 300 acres. At the time of the rewriting of this zone in July of 2000, there were only 2 owners of this entire land area, with Griffin Land Resources owning all but approximately 32 acres. The undeveloped nature of the property and the small number of owners provide the Town with a unique opportunity to guide the development of this area to assure that it is compatible with the Town’s Plan of Conservation and Development. The ED zone has several important attributes. It is strategically located geographically, with direct access to Route 10/202 and easy access to Route 
189. The ED Zone can be serviced by public water and public sewer and is linked to major electrical and communication services. The area that comprises the ED Zone has been set aside for non-residential development since zoning was first established in Granby in the 1950s. This is the primary and only significant area remaining within the Town with potential for the diversification of the Town’s tax, employment and commercial service base. It is the desire of the Town of Granby to have this area developed in a manner, which accomplishes this diversification while preserving the Town’s fundamental values and rural atmosphere as outlined within the Plan of Conservation and Development. Understanding the attributes of the ED Zone, as outlined above, the Town has an opportunity to encourage development within this area in a manner that can be a model of quality and success. The development of the ED Zone can demonstrate that preservation and growth are not mutually exclusive and that diversification of the Town’s tax, employment and commercial service base, while preserving the Town’s fundamental values and rural atmosphere, can be achieved. A variety of Special Regulations have been adopted to regulate development within this ED Zone. These Regulations are found in Section 
3.9.4.

USE DISTRICTS 

SPECIAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE ED ZONE. 
3.9.4.1 CURB CUT LOCATIONS/TRAFFIC ANALYSIS 
The Route 10 corridor study recognizes the area of the ED Zone as a future development area. While Salmon Brook Street and Floydville Road can accommodate additional traffic volumes, the development of the area must be accomplished with careful attention to managing traffic flow and minimizing increasing traffic volumes. The addition of turn lanes, acceleration and decelerations lanes may be appropriate in the design of new developments, but the overall widening of Salmon Brook Street and/or Floydville Road above the 2 travel lanes is not. Care must be taken to diversify the land uses within the ED Zone to limit the impact of peak hour volumes. A complete traffic analysis by a competent traffic engineer will be required for all applications that have the potential to impact the existing road network. 
The street frontage along Route 10 and 202 and Floydville Road, within the ED Zone, is extensive. In an effort to manage the traffic flow within this area, curb cuts shall be limited within the ED zone as follows: 
• 	
No more than three new curb cuts may be created along Route 10 and 202. These curb cuts shall be located in basic conformance with the locations shown on the ED zone curb cut map attached hereto. 

• 	
No more than four curb cuts may be created along Floydville Road. These curb cuts shall be located in basic conformance with the locations shown on the ED zone curb cut map attached hereto. 

• 	
All intersection leading into the ED zone shall be major intersections, which include the construction of a town road. These town roads shall be designed in accordance with the Town of Granby Road Standards and shall typically include a right of way, which extends to the rear of all properties, allowing for the future linkage of roads to Floydville Road and/or Route 10 and 202 as appropriate 

• 	
Any proposed subdivision of property within the ED zone shall be designed in basic conformance with the ED zone curb cut map. All new lots created shall have their primary frontage along the new town roads. 


The majority of the new development created within the ED zone shall be internal to the site and have the primary access not along the existing roads but along the new Town of Granby roads, which will extend throughout the area. 
USE DISTRICTS 


3.9.4.2 	FRONT YARD SETBACKS FROM FLOYDVILLE ROAD AND SALMON BROOK STREET 
The properties located within the ED Zone contain approximately 4,700 feet of frontage along Salmon Brook Street and 4,500 feet of frontage along Floydville Road. To preserve and promote the scenic quality of these roads, and to further the goals of the Town’s Plan of Conservation and Development, the Commission shall give serious consideration to the establishment of Streetscape Buffers as outlined within Section 4.2.5 of the Regulations and in accordance with the criteria established therein. 
As a large portion of the streetscape within this area is void of significant vegetation, in determining the depth of the Streetscape Buffer the Commission shall give added weight to the quantity and quality of any new vegetation proposed along the frontage of the of the site. 

3.9.4.3 	OPEN SPACE 
As stated in the general purposes of this zone, the area contains ample amounts of land, providing an opportunity to create significant areas of open space. Within the ED zone undeveloped areas shall be set aside to create a park like setting. In order to accomplish such a setting, an effort shall be made, and the Commission may require open space areas that are comprehensively linked throughout the ED zone. Such areas of open space shall be designed to complement building placement and to enhance the working environment of the employees and others who frequent the commercial facilities by serving as recreational corridors, public spaces, and natural areas. In lieu of the requirements of Section 4.2.5.B, all developments shall have a primary and contiguous open space area equal to the footprint of the proposed building or buildings. This open space area shall be located to balance the developed areas, serving the above stated purpose. Where a development fronts Salmon Brook Street and /or Floydville Road, the open space requirement may be satisfied through the creation of the streetscape buffer/open space setback. 
All developments shall be designed with consideration of a means of linkage with the Farmington Valley Greenway. This recreational and commuter corridor is located in East Granby just east of the Granby Town Line, bisecting property currently owned by Griffin Land. By connecting developments to the Greenway the Town and the developer will encourage the use of alternate means of commuting to the new business developments, particularly by bicycle, while providing increased recreational and social opportunities for the business employees. Greenway connectors may be designed to run adjacent to proposed roadways or be internally located, meandering between buildings, parking areas and open space. Greenway connectors will typically have a minimum paved width of 10 feet. 
USE DISTRICTS 
3.9.4.4 Parking 
The size of the parking area is dictated by the required number of parking spaces, outlined within Section 7 of these Regulations. All parking lots shall be designed for the ease and clarity of traffic flow and as an aesthetic design element of the development. Safe pedestrian movement must also be provided within the parking lot. Large planting islands are encouraged within the parking areas to reduce visual and audio impacts and the impact of heat, while aiding in drainage and snow removal. Parking areas that are designed in modules, separated by landscaped islands, are encouraged and will aid in conforming to the design recommendations outlined herein. Landscaped islands shall contain not less than 360 square feet (18x20) and shall provide a landscaped break between parking spaces as outlined within Section 7. The Commission may permit greater groupings of parking spaces when the size, design and placement of the landscape islands demonstrate the desirability of such groupings. Landscaped islands shall be designed to accommodate plants, shrubs and trees, particularly maple trees, of sufficient size and quantity to meet the above purposes. In order to provide the landscape island with sufficient water, necessary to support the plant life, the applicant, in designing the site, shall consider recessing the landscape islands below the paved area rather than raised and surrounded with curbing. The Commission may require recessed islands where design and soil conditions warrant such requirements. A portion of the surrounding paved area shall be pitched towards the recessed islands, thereby directing storm water to these areas. The overall parking lot drainage analyses shall outline the volume of storm water directed to landscape islands, in addition to that, which is directed into the structural drainage system. 
No more than 50% of the parking area for the entire property shall be located between the front facade of the principal building(s) and the primary abutting street. The Commission may modify this requirement based on the placement of the open space, number and actual design of the adjacent street(s), the size of the parking lot, the design of the building and the quality of the overall parking lot design. 

3.9.4.5 Drainage/Aquifer Protection Area 
The ED zone is located within an aquifer protection area. The drainage of the parking lots shall recognize the concerns for the aquifer and shall be designed accordingly. 
USE DISTRICTS 
All parking lots shall discharge storm water to a retention or detention pond which shall be designed to mirror the functions of a natural wetlands in an effort to slow the CFS and to provide for the purification of the storm water before it enters the Salmon Brook or other drainage way. All uses, identified above shall be specifically reviewed for compliance with the Section 8.21, Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone. In the event of a conflict between the ED zone regulations and the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone regulations, the latter shall take precedence. 

3.9.4.6 Retail Development 
While retail development is permitted as a Special Permit use within the ED zone, additional regulations have been established to promote the establishment of smaller retail operators that can more readily serve the employees and diverse users of the businesses within the ED Zone. Individual Business within the ED Zone may occupy no more than 40,000 square feet of retail space, except that the Commission may permit up to 75,000 square feet, when at least two thirds of the voting members vote in favor of the increase. In determining whether or not to allow the square footage to exceed 40,000 square feet, the Commission shall consider the building design, the site characteristics, the compatibility of the structure with surrounding buildings, the quality of building materials and the quantity and quality of the landscape materials, all of which can aid in reducing the visual bulk and mass of the building. Retail uses shall be limited to the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and the Commission may further restrict the hours of the retail development based on the specific proposal for use. While retail buildings may exceed 40,000 square feet in overall area, the design of the building shall be broken up in appearance in an effort to make the buildings appear to be of a much smaller scale. This design will come about by using and applying the design guidelines outline in Section 4.2.9. To prevent the ED zone from being dominated by retail uses, a strict limit on the overall square footage for retail use is as follows: 
The total square footage of retail use shall be limited to 4% of the total square footage of land area existing on any property or lot where the retail use is proposed. For example, a 10-acre lot can accommodate no more than 17,424 square feet of retail use. (43,560 x 10 acres = 435,600 square feet x .04 = 17,424 square feet of retail use. 
USE DISTRICTS 


3.9.4.7 Diversification of Uses 
As stated in Section 3.9.4.1, care must be taken to diversify the land uses within the ED Zone in order to limit the impact of peak hour traffic volumes. Additionally, the diversification of commercial uses is a goal of the Town’s Plan of Conservation and Development. The Commission must be diligent in its consideration of special permit uses within the ED Zone. Should the Commission find that particular Special Permit uses are beginning to dominate the zone, it must reject future such applications until a more adequate mix of uses begins to evolve. 

3.9.4.8 Building Design Review 
The Zoning Regulations currently contain building design guidelines, outlined within Section 4.2.9 of these regulations. However, based on a recommendation of the ED Zone Subcommittee, The Commission, upon adoption of these regulations will begin the process of establishing a Building Design Review Board, which will serve as an advisory board to the Commission. Prior to the establishment of a permanent board, the Commission will establish a preliminary Board of at least 3 members who are licensed design professionals. These preliminary members shall prepare detailed operating and design guidelines for review and possible adoption by the Commission. Upon adoption, all buildings proposed within the ED Zone shall be reviewed by the DRB, and the Board shall provide the Commission with appropriate recommendations. Until such time that a permanent DRB is established, together with all operating and design guidelines, any proposed development within the ED Zone shall be reviewed by the Commission and the guidelines as outlined within Section 4.2.9 applied. The DRB shall make recommendations to the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning new development applications, but shall not have any independent decision-making authority. 

3.9.4.9 Site Lighting 
Site lighting shall be designed as the absolute minimum necessary to achieve the desired purpose. Light pollution and excessively bright or intrusive lighting is a concern in the Town of Granby. Lighting plans shall include the height and type of poles, the design of the fixtures (primarily those that provide full horizon shading), the wattage and type of lighting and a written justification, with citation to published standards by authoritive sources, for the amount and type of lighting proposed. Lighting plans shall also include an illumination profile outlining the level of lighting, in foot-candles, produced throughout the site. Lighting shall be a specific design element of the development, comprehensively planned with uniformity of poles, fixtures and lighting. Metal halide lighting shall be considered for use throughout the ED Zone. 
USE DISTRICTS 


3.9.4.10 	Noise 
Noise is a community concern and should be considered and measures taken to reduce its impact, in the design of all developments. The large and undeveloped nature of the ED Zone provides the developer with the opportunity to locate buildings, loading docks, dumpsters and parking areas in a manner that will reduce the impact of noise on surrounding properties, particularly residential properties. Care should be taken to buffer areas of potential noise by shielding such areas through the strategic placement of buildings, earth berms or through a combination of these and other appropriate techniques. 

3.9.4.11 	Buffering/Transition of Uses 
The Town is concerned about the impact of future development on existing residential properties. The requirements of the above sections will aid in reducing the negative impact of ED Zone uses on residential properties. The ED Zone permitted uses, and the uses outlined in Sections 3.9.2.3 and 3.9.2.4, given proper site design, are suitable to properly transition the ED Zone use from the residential use. This is less clear with a number of the other ED Zone uses. Therefore, developments that are to be within 1,000 feet of a residential zone must be of a use and design chosen with consideration of the impact on the nearby residential properties. More compatible ED Zone uses, such as offices, shall generally be preferred within these areas to the more intense ED Zone uses such as retail sales. 

3.9.4.12 	Outside Storage 
No goods, merchandise, equipment or machinery shall be stored or displayed outside of a building unless the areas are specifically authorized by the Commission as a part of a site plan or special permit approval. Parking spaces and landscaping areas shall not be used for sales, storage, display of goods or for advertising purposes of any kind, except for detached signs installed in conformance with these Regulations. 
All commercial activity shall be conducted wholly within enclosed buildings, except for off-street loading, periodic sidewalk sales and other operations normally conducted outdoors, and excepting other uses specifically authorized by the Commission as part of a site plan or special permit approval. 
3.9.4.13 	The provisions of Sections 3.8.4.1 through 3.8.4.4 of these Regulations are incorporated by reference into this Section, as if set forth in full herein. 





USE DISTRICTS 

3.9.4.14 	In the ED Zone, lots may be established in accordance with Sections a-f herein, when lots are created on newly constructed town roads. No lot may be approved under this section unless all of the lot lines that make up the parcel are set back a minimum of 500 feet from Salmon Brook Street and Floydville Road. 
The minimum criteria that follow are reductions in the requirements outlined within Section 5. While the Commission may approve lots that comply with the reduced criteria, all subdivided lots must be in compliance with the Subdivision Regulations and all Zoning Regulations not specifically reduced herein. 

MINIMUM 
a. 
Lot area 50,000 sq. ft.

3.10 	NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMERCIAL TRANSITION ZONE -T1 
3.10.0 	Goal of the T1 Zone 
The T1 zone is adopted in an effort to avoid the development of small commercial establishments along Route 10, through the elimination of an existing commercial strip zone. The T1 zone encourages comprehensive development and the cooperation of individual landowners. A primary goal of the zone is to avoid the establishment of commercial curb cuts along Route 10, while requiring that new commercial buildings be placed at least 100 feet back from Salmon Brook Street. The T1 zone is designed to provide a transition of uses, from high intensity commercial use to residential use. This transition can be achieved by combining existing lots, limiting new curb cuts along Route 10, limiting the size of commercial buildings, regulating the style and quality of construction and establishing buffer areas. The objective is to create a unified commercial or mixed use area, developed with an internal service road. All applications for development within the T1 zone must take into account this concept for an internal roadway. Designs that will prevent the possibility of bringing this concept to fruition shall not be approved. 
The transitional zone is created in recognition of the commercial growth that is occurring in this area, the relocation of the Canton Road intersection, the availability of public water and public sewer and the Town’s overall success in limiting curb cuts and managing traffic flow within the overall area. 
USE DISTRICTS  
The following regulations and standards are designed to bring about the above goal.  
3.10.1  Permitted Uses  
The following uses are permitted:  
3.10.1.1  Single-family dwellings;

3.10.2.11  Assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, multi-family residential  

3.10.2.12 	Accessory uses customarily incidental to principal uses. 



3.10.3 	Special T1, Zone Criteria 
3.10.3.1 The Special Permit uses listed above may only be approved on a lot which contains a minimum of 4 acres. 
3.10.3.2 	The maximum area of the footprint of a single commercial building is 20,000 square feet. 
3.10.3.3 	All commercial buildings must be clearly separated by a minimum of 30 feet. 
3.10.3.4 	The establishment of commercial uses that do not currently exist within the Town shall be preferred over the replication of existing uses. 
3.10.3.5 	The combined area of the footprints of all commercial buildings must be less than or equal to 20% of the total land area. (Example: 4.6 acres = 200,376 square feet. 20% of 200,376 = 40,075. Therefore, the total area of the footprint of any combination of commercial buildings on a property of 4.6 acres shall be 40,075 square feet, or less) 
3.10.3.6 	No Special Permit use may be approved unless the Route 10 curb cut (west side), which serves the Special Permit use, is separated by at least 800 feet from any other curb cut, serving a Special Permit use and also located on the west side of Route 10. For the purpose of this regulation the existing YMCA curb cut is a curb cut serving a Special Permit use. This is the only commercial curb cut that exists within the T1 zone as of the adoption of this regulation. New Special Permit developments that do not comply with the curb cut separations may not be approved. 
3.10.3.7 	A primary purpose of this zone is to encourage the construction of an internal service road which extends from a point opposite Floydville Road to a point located on Canton Road Extension, as outlined above. It is anticipated that the majority of new uses will be serviced through the construction of this service road. The internal roadway shall be designed as a Town Road and easements shall be established at property boundaries to permit the future extension of the road. It is understood that the road may be constructed in segments and further understood that the actual transfer of the ownership of the road, to the Town, may occur at a future date, well after the earliest road segments were constructed. All appropriate bonds, deeds and easements shall be maintained to provide for the future transfer of the ownership of the road to the Town. 
3.10.3.8 	All developments shall provide vehicular and pedestrian easements, at the direction, and in locations determined by the Commission, to allow passage to and from adjacent properties to achieve the goals of the T1 zone. 

3.10.3.9 No parking area, for a commercial development may be located within 100 feet 
of the Salmon Brook street line. 
3.10.3.10 	A landscape buffer area of not less than 150 feet shall separate any proposed Special Permit uses from single family homes, existing on the date of adoption of this regulation, and located within the adjacent R30 zone. The Commission shall determine the planting and design requirements for all such buffer areas. The preservation of existing trees and shrubs for buffering is preferred to the planting of new materials. However, the planting of new materials may also be required to supplement the existing vegetation. Applicants are advised not to remove existing vegetation prior to the Commission’s consideration of an application. Where existing vegetation has been removed prior to the filing of an application, the Commission may deny the application and recommend that the removed vegetation be replaced. 



3.10.3.11 	RESERVE 
3.10.3.12 	A landscaped Streetscape buffer along the frontage of Salmon Brook Street shall be designed for each application. Where possible, applicants shall use the design elements of the landscape berm located at 124 Salmon Brook Street (Stop and Shop Plaza) as a guide in designing the streetscape buffer. 
3.10.3.13 	No goods, merchandise, equipment or machinery shall be stored or displayed outside of a building unless the areas are specifically authorized by the Commission as a part of a site plan or special permit approval. Parking spaces and landscaping areas shall not be used for the sales, storage, display of goods or for advertising purposes of any kind, except for detached signs installed in conformance with these Regulations. 
3.10.3.14 	All commercial activity shall be conducted wholly within enclosed buildings, except for off-street loading, periodic sidewalk sales and other operations normally conducted outdoors, and excepting other uses specifically authorized by the Commission as part of a site plan or special permit approval. 
3.10.3.15 	Site lighting shall be designed as the absolute minimum necessary to achieve the desired purpose. Light pollution and excessively bright or intrusive lighting is a concern in the Town of Granby. Lighting plans shall include the height and type of poles, the design of the fixtures (primarily those that provide full horizon shading), the wattage and type of lighting and a written justification, with citation to published standards by authoritive sources, for the amount and type of lighting proposed. Lighting plans shall also include an illumination profile outlining the level of lighting, in foot-candles, produced throughout the site. Lighting shall be a specific design element of the development, comprehensively planned with uniformity of poles, fixtures and lighting. Metal halide lighting shall be considered for use throughout the T1 Zone. 

USE DISTRICTS 
3.10.3.16 	Noise is a community concern and should be considered and measures taken to reduce its impact, in the design of all developments. Care should be taken to buffer areas of potential noise by shielding such areas through the strategic placement of buildings, earth berms or through a combination of these and other appropriate techniques. 
3.10.3.17 	A complete site plan as outlined within Section 4 shall be prepared for all special permit uses as stated above. 
3.10.3.18 	Parking requirements shall be as outlined within Section 7. The Commission may waive the specific requirements regarding the location of parking spaces to achieve the goals of the T1 zone as stated above. 
3.10.3.19 	All Special Permit Application shall include an analysis of the anticipated vehicular traffic that will be generated by the proposed use. Of specific concern is the peak hour traffic and the related turning movements of vehicles during the peak hours. The Commission shall strive to establish a mix of commercial uses which differ in their peak hours of traffic generation. 
3.10.4 	Required Lot Areas, Yards, Coverage, Heights and Frontages shall be as outlined for the R30 zone in Section 5, except as outlined herein. The Commission may waive the requirements of Section 5 to achieve the goals of the T1 zone as stated above.

3.10.5.1 	High quality masonry building materials (brick, stone, or materials having the appearance of them) should make up no less than 50 percent of the wall surface area, not including windows, of any façade of the building. The balance of wall surface area shall be made up of wood siding or shingle (shakes) or a combination of wood and synthetics. However, synthetic materials shall be limited to no more than 25 percent of the surface area of any façade other than the rear façade and shall not be permitted in any degree on the front façade. 
3.10.5.2 	Substantial structural elements shall be made prominent in building design to provide relief to large walls, create visual interest, define entrances, and convey a sense of permanence. 
3.10.5.3 	Use of carefully chosen architectural details, such as cornices, brackets, and awnings is encouraged. 
USE DISTRICTS  
3.10.5.4  Building material colors should primarily consist of neutrals and darker tones.  
3.10.5.5  Whenever practicable, recessed entrances should be used to allow for a small outdoor shelter, increase window display area, reduce the massing and add relief to a façade.  
3.10.5.6 3.10.5.7  Doors should be designed so as to make the doorway a unique and inviting architectural characteristic of the building. It is not essential that the primary entranceways be situated toward the street.  
3.10.5.8  In cases where a customer entrance is required at the rear of a building the standards of the rear façade shall equal the quality of design and materials of the façade facing the front.  
3.10.5.9  Roof materials should be chosen with respect for building sustainability and durability.  
3.10.5.10  Standing seam metal, or other dimensional, commercial grade shingle, slate, or simulated slate roofing in neutral colors should be preferred.  
3.10.5.11  Parking should be central to the overall development and if possible, surrounded on no less than two sides by the proposed commercial business.  
3.10.5.12  Parking should be situated to provide efficient pedestrian business to business to ensure that a single parking space enough to all corners of the commercial center.  access will be  from close  
3.10.5.13  The circulation lanes of the parking area should be located adjacent to the front facade, should be characterized by benches, street trees, trash receptacles, high quality materials, textured pedestrian crossings and pedestrian scale lighting. The desired effect of such an arrangement is to create a small scale “main street” environment within individually developed cluster mixed-use or commercial centers.  
3.10.5.14  Extensive use of street trees and curbside landscaping should characterize the T1 zone.  
3.10.5.15  A system of sidewalks, designed for the convenience of pedestrian traffic, shall be incorporated in all development applications. Sidewalks shall be designed and constructed to serve pedestrian movement within each proposed development and with consideration of linkages to adjacent sites. Proposed site plans shall also include provisions for pedestrian and non-motorized amenities, such as benches (stand alone or permanent fixture), garbage receptacles, and bicycle racks.  

USE DISTRICTS  
3.10.5.16  In cluster commercial settings, pedestrian pathways should be covered along the front façade by awnings or arcades to permit efficient all weather pedestrian circulation from business to business.  
3.10.5.17  Developments shall consider incorporating outdoor plaza areas containing benches, trash receptacles, landscaping, instructional signage, and partial shelter (such as a gazebo or awning). Outdoor plazas may also be characterized by substantial defining central amenities, such as a fountain, a clock tower or public art. Out-door plaza areas should be centrally located, insofar as possible. Restaurant uses having outdoor cafes should be encouraged to located adjacent to and interplay with plaza areas to encourage public use of the space.  
3.10.5.18  Ground mounted mechanical equipment may be located along a rear façade, but should be screened from view by a decorative masonry screen wall comprised of masonry materials mimicking or complimenting those used in the primary structure.  
3.10.5.19  Roof mounted mechanical equipment should be screened from public view.

GRANBY CENTER ZONE 

Statement of Intent 
The Granby Center Zone is a unique zoning district promulgated to allow and regulate a variety of related land uses within an interconnected area. This Center Zone is enacted to further the goals and objectives of the Plan of Conservation and Development by expanding the Town Center through the incorporation of compatible commercial, residential, governmental, educational and other uses often found within a traditional town center. The further goal of the zone is to encourage the continued rehabilitation of the commercial center, encourage a greater variety of mixed uses and unite the uses through common design features, pedestrian and vehicular access, common signage, lighting and through the inclusion of street furniture and common open areas. Overall the goal is to integrate commercial and noncommercial uses through the creation of a mixed-use district that has the look and feel of a traditional New England village. The Granby Center Zone is designed to maintain and promote an area where residential development can exist within reasonable proximity to commercial type development. Development in the District will be guided by an overall desire to create a thriving Village with a wide variety of businesses and housing where residents can walk to work, work from home and walk from business to business. While the District is certainly designed to permit a variety of commercial developments, encourage new and innovative housing development, and preserve the Granby Historic District, overall it is designed to establish a sense of place that is different from the low density housing and preserved open space that characterize most of the Town of Granby. 
The Granby Center Zone is designed to: promote the efficient use of a limited land area; respect and reinforce historic development patterns; provide flexibility to meet changing needs, technologies, economics and consumer preferences; promote efficient development patterns and a land use mix which encourages walking and bicycling and encouraging compatible architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within a New England Village. 
The Granby Center Zone consists of four components: 
Commercial Center; 
Center Commons; 
Center Edge, and 
Granby Center Historic Overlay District, 
all as outlined within the Granby Zoning Map. 

USE DISTRICTS 
Each of these zones has a separate set of permitted and special permit uses and design criteria. The Comprehensive Granby Center Zone Criteria shall be applied to all 4 components of the Center Zone. 
3.12.1 Commercial Center Zone 
The Commercial Center is the primary commercial area within the Town of Granby. It contains a variety of retail, service and office uses, numerous restaurants, gas stations, banks, the Post Office and more. The Commercial Center contains the Town Green and serves as the primary gathering place for Town residents. The Commercial Center contains very few residential units and its current design pattern discourages residential use. Future residential use is not anticipated within the area. 

Commercial Center Zone Permitted Uses. 
In the Commercial Center Zone, the following uses are permitted subject to the Commercial Center Zone Special Criteria, Section 4 and other applicable requirements. 
• 	
Business or professional offices; 

• 	
Restaurant, limited seating. 



Commercial Center Zone Special Permit uses. 
In the Commercial Center Zone the following uses may be permitted by Special Permit, subject to the Commercial Center Zone Special Criteria, Section 8.2 and other applicable requirements. 
• 	
Retail sale, rental and/or repair of items such as food, clothing, hardware, garden supplies, jewelry, electronics, appliances, books, sporting goods, nursery items, home improvement products and general merchandise; 

• 	
Printing, photography and similar service; 

• 	
Banks and other financial institutions;

• 
Retail sales or alcoholic beverages, subject to Section 8.3; 

• 
Open air markets; 

• 
Multifamily use; 

• 
Accessory uses customarily incidental to the above uses. 


Commercial Center Zone Special Criteria 
The maximum area of the footprint of a single commercial building is 8,000 square feet. The Commission may permit an expansion of an existing building (existing on the date of approval of this regulation) that would increase the footprint above 8,000 square feet, where such expansion conforms to the general principles of the zone. Where an existing building is removed/demolished in whole or in part, the Commission may permit the reconstruction or new construction of a building that exceeds a footprint of 8,000 square feet, provided the construction is in basic conformity with the scale of the existing site and conforms to the general principles of the zone. As a general rule the Commission shall encourage the construction of multi-story buildings, with reduced footprints. 
Parking requirements shall be as outlined within Section 7. The Commission may waive the specific requirements regarding the number and location of parking spaces to achieve the goals of the zone as stated herein. Individual developments are encouraged to share parking and access. Shared parking can be used to comply with the parking requirements. 
The Commission may waive the minimum landscape area of Section 4.2.5 to achieve the goals of this zone as stated herein. 


USE DISTRICTS 
Adjacent property owners are encouraged to share curb cuts leading to the adjacent roadways. No new curb cuts will be permitted within this zone, except that any existing lot legally establish prior to the date of adoption of this regulation shall have the right to access the adjacent roadway. Existing curb cuts may be relocated. 
Pedestrian access to the proposed building, from the nearest street, shall be incorporated within the site design. Pedestrian and vehicular access from adjacent sites shall be incorporated where feasible. 
Required Lot Areas, Yards, Coverage, Heights and Frontages shall be as outlined for the C2 Zone in Section 5, except that the minimum front yard shall be 25 feet. This change is made in an effort to encourage parking at the rear and sides of the building and to aid in design interest and flexibility. 
3.12.2 Center Commons 
The Center Commons Zone is a diverse area of office buildings, public service use, retail use and housing.

Center Edge Zone Special Criteria 
All new construction within this zone shall be designed in a residential style, designed to blend and enhance the historic nature of the area, if the construction is within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District or adjacent to any structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Use of carefully chosen architectural details, such as cornices, brackets, shutters, columns and awnings is encouraged within such areas. The exterior colors of building materials shall mirror or be compatible with the colors of nearby buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building color schemes shall be a specific part of any approval. 
The site design for any proposed new development or for the re-use of an existing building must blend with the traditional area site design as appropriate for the specific location. This would typically include lawn between the structure and the street and parking to the side or rear of the building within the Historic District. 
The maximum area of the footprint of a building that is used for non residential purposes is 4,000 square feet. 
The building frontage (front yard) shall be guided by the average frontage of existing buildings located within the immediate vicinity of any proposed new building or addition. 
The building front yard shall be a minimum of 50 feet, except that the Commission may permit a front yard of less than 50 feet, but not less than 30 feet, where other area buildings have front yards of less than 50 feet. In determining the front yard the Commission shall consider the front yard setback of existing buildings located within 600 feet of the proposed new building. 
Required Lot Areas, Yards, Coverage, Heights and Frontages shall be as outlined for the R30 Zone in Section 5, except that the minimum front yard shall be 30 feet.

USE DISTRICTS 
3.12.4 Granby Center Historic Overlay District 
The Granby Center Historic Overlay District is a specific area outlined within the Granby Zoning Map and located within the comprehensive Granby Center Zone. The overlay district generally follows the boundaries of the Granby Center Historic District, a large and beautiful area that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Granby Center Historic Overlay District is not a separate zone, but an area which overlays upon the other Center Zones. Within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District additional requirements and regulations will be applied as specifically outlined with the Center Zones. 
3.12.5 Comprehensive Granby Center Zone Criteria 
The following requirements and guidelines shall apply to all Center Zones: 
1. 	
The primary and most appropriate use of existing homes within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District portion of the Center Edge zone, is residential use. 

2. 	
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall notify the Salmon Brook Historical Society, within 10 days of the receipt of any application that includes a property, or any portion of a property located within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District. 

3. 	
Due to the historic nature of the buildings and the desire to maintain the traditional quality of the existing landscape, any proposed re-use or renovation of buildings located within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District shall be accomplished in a manner which preserves the historic integrity of the building’s exterior façades and preserves the traditional design of the grounds, particularly the front area facing the street. 

4. 	
The conversion of low density housing to multifamily housing is generally encouraged, except within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District. 

5. 	
Design criteria for multifamily developments shall generally follow the criteria of the PDM Zone, Section 3.7.4, except that a maximum number of 15 units per acre may be permitted. Structures that are visible from Salmon Brook Street shall be designed to blend with the historic designs typically found within the Granby Center Historic Overlay District. Multi­story structures are preferred over single story structures. 






USE DISTRICTS 
6. 	
When considering Special Permit applications, the Commission shall encourage the establishment of commercial uses that do not currently exist within the Town Center area. The zone’s permitted uses will be preferable to the establishment of uses that are allowed only by Special Permit where such special permit uses replicate existing center businesses. The Commission, the public and new applicants should recognize the limited area of the Town Center and the need to diversify the commercial uses. The success of the center as a local commercial service center is largely dependent on the availability of a wide range of commercial retail items, services and offices. An abundance of offices (permitted uses) will enhance the overall business environment as the office workers are likely to frequent the other center businesses during the morning, lunch and dinner times. 

7. 	
Multi-storied buildings are preferred over single story buildings. Single use one story structures shall be discouraged except in unique situations where the property cannot support a multi-story structure and multiple uses. 

8. 	
Where mixed use buildings are proposed that will contain both residential and nonresidential uses, the number of residential units may not exceed 15 per acre. Living units shall typically be located above the first floor and shall be serviced by elevators and fire prevention sprinkler systems. The minimum area of a residential unit is 400 square feet. One parking space per unit shall be required. Overall the density of the site will be guided by the site development requirements outlined herein. 

9. 	
Applications for new commercial construction shall include an analysis of the anticipated vehicular traffic that will be generated by the proposed use. Of specific concern are the peak hour traffic and the related turning movements of vehicles during the peak hours. The Commission shall strive to establish a mix of commercial uses, which differ in their peak hours of traffic generation. 


10.Parking requirements shall be as outlined within Section 7. The Commission may waive the specific requirements regarding the location of parking spaces to achieve the goals of the zone as stated above. Vehicular access and parking shall be designed to permit passage between adjacent properties. Shared parking is strongly encouraged. 
11.Curb cuts shall be closely scrutinized by the Commission. The existing traffic flow within the area is often delayed and poorly placed curb cuts and/or increased numbers of curb cuts will exacerbate the problem. Therefore the Commission shall require the sharing of curb cuts between property owners and may prohibit a proposal for non-residential use of property where the curb cut separation is found to be unsatisfactory. A minimum distance of 150 feet between curb cuts is preferred. 

USE DISTRICTS 
12.A system of sidewalks, designed for the convenience of pedestrian traffic, shall be incorporated in all proposed development applications. Sidewalks shall be designed and constructed to serve pedestrian movement within each proposed site and with consideration of linkages to adjacent sites. Proposed site plans shall also include provisions for pedestrian and non-motorized amenities, such as benches (stand alone or permanent fixture), garbage receptacles, and bicycle racks. All site designs shall include sidewalks, which lead from the existing street to the proposed or re-used structure. The application shall include a pedestrian access plan that links the proposed site to other properties within the Center. 
13.Extensive use of street trees and curbside landscaping should characterize the developments. 
14.Businesses developments shall consider incorporating outdoor plaza areas containing benches, trash receptacles, landscaping, instructional signage, and partial shelter (such as a gazebo or awning). Outdoor plazas may also be characterized by substantial defining central amenities, such as a fountain, a clock tower or public art. Outdoor plaza areas should be centrally located, insofar as possible. Restaurant uses having outdoor cafes are encouraged. 
15.No goods, merchandise, equipment or machinery shall be stored or displayed outside of a building unless the areas are specifically authorized by the Commission as a part of a site plan or special permit approval. Parking spaces and landscaping areas shall not be used for the sales, storage, and display of goods or for advertising purposes of any kind, except for detached signs installed in conformance with these Regulations. 
16.All commercial activity shall be conducted wholly within enclosed buildings, except for off-street loading, periodic sidewalk sales and other operations normally conducted outdoors, and excepting other uses specifically authorized by the Commission as part of a site plan or special permit approval. 
17.Ground mounted mechanical equipment may be located along a rear façade, but should be screened from view. Screening shall be designed with materials that mimic or complement those used in the primary structure. 
18.Roof mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view. 
19.Utilities shall normally be located underground. 

USE DISTRICTS 
20.Site lighting shall be designed as the absolute minimum necessary to achieve the desired purpose. All exterior light poles and lighting fixture must of a type and style that mirrors the existing poles and fixtures located along Bank Street. These are often identified as traditional style and can be found in figure 2 outlined below. The height of pole, to the top of the fixture shall be between 9-14 feet. 
21.Noise is a community concern and should be considered in the site design and measures taken to reduce its impact, in the design of all developments. Care should be taken to buffer areas of potential noise by shielding such areas through the strategic placement of plantings, buildings, earth berms or through a combination of these and other appropriate techniques. 
22.All freestanding and directory signs shall be of wood (simulated wood or wood composite) construction and suspended from either one or 2 poles as outlined in figure 3 below. Signs shall be externally illuminated with the light typically emitted onto the face of the sign from a fixture or fixtures located above the sign face. Narrow signs and uniquely shaped signs may be illuminated by ground mounted lighting fixtures, where approved by the Commission. The lighting intensity shall be the minimum necessary to illuminate the sign face.

A. 	Preserve the pre-development site hydrology to the greatest extent possible. 
B. 	Preserve and protect streams, channels, wetlands, water bodies, watercourses and other natural features that protect water quality and provide water quality and quantity benefits. 
C. 	Reduce the peak rate of runoff from developed land to minimize increases in flooding. 
D. 	Manage stormwater runoff in a manner that maintains or improves the physical and biological characteristics of existing drainage systems, both on-site and off-site, and prevents increases in downstream flooding, stream bank erosion and water pollution. 
E. 	Emphasize non-structural approaches to controlling runoff and water quality, where appropriate. 
F. 	Prevent pollution of drinking water sources, both above ground and below ground (aquifers) by minimizing the discharge of soluble pollutants. 
G. 	Prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters and wetlands that exceed the systems ability to assimilate or treat the pollutants. 
H. 	Reduce the average total suspended solids (TSS) loadings in the post development runoff by at least 80 per cent (80%). 
I. 	Remove oils, greases and vehicle fluids from the post development runoff, prior to the runoff leaving the site. 
J. 	Incorporate stormwater management practices that mitigate potential increases in the temperature of runoff. 
The analysis and design of drainage systems and stormwater management systems shall utilize the following publications, at a minimum; 
• 	
State of Connecticut Department of Transportation (CONNDOT) Drainage Manual; 

•

U. S. Soil Conservation Service TR-20 Manual; 

• 	
Connecticut Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment Control (2002); 

• 	
Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual (2004). 


4.2.4.1 Stormwater Management Requirements 
The following stormwater management requirements shall be addressed: 
• 	
All proposed developments shall include an analysis of the upstream tributary drainage area and shall include a downstream impact analysis based on the post-development conditions. 

• 	
Proposed developments shall attenuate the post-development peak runoff rate to no more than the pre-development peak runoff rate, unless otherwise modified by the Commission. 


SECTION 4 
SITE PLANS 

• 	
All drainage/conveyance systems, whether structural or non­structural, shall be analyzed, designed and constructed to accommodate existing upstream off-site runoff and developed on-site runoff (post-development). 

• 	
Proposed developments shall include provisions for the treatment of surface runoff in order to minimize the discharge of pollutants into existing conveyance systems, watercourses, water bodies and wetlands. 

• 	
All proposed developments shall include measures to control soil erosion and sedimentation during construction and post-development. 

• 	
Maintenance of all proposed drainage systems/facilities not dedicated to the Town shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner or property association. Maintenance and operation plans/schedules shall be part of any approved site plan. 



4.2.4.2 Stormwater Quantity 
All stormwater conveyance systems, storm sewer systems, surface drainage systems, detention systems, swales, channels, etc. shall be appropriate for the site and shall be designed in accordance with current engineering practice. Design storm frequencies used in the drainage analysis shall be appropriate for the site and shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Town and the CONNDOT Drainage Manual. 
4.2.4.2.1 Peak Runoff Attenuation 
Peak runoff attenuation can be accomplished by limiting impervious coverage, increasing travel times, utilizing pervious pavements, introducing groundwater recharge, constructing stormwater detention facilities or other approved methods. Increases in peak runoff must be attenuated for the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year and 100-year storm unless otherwise modified by the Commission. Detention systems not dedicated to the Town will require an operation and maintenance schedule which addresses: items of routine maintenance; frequency of maintenance; the party responsible for maintenance; and an emergency operation plan. 


4.2.4.3 Stormwater Quality 
All site developments shall include provisions for the treatment of stormwater runoff in order to minimize the transport of pollutants downstream or into the groundwater. These treatment requirements are an important part of the Town’s strategy to comply with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Phase II Requirements for Post-Construction Runoff Control. 
SECTION 4 
SITE PLANS 

4.2.4.3.1 Stormwater Treatment Procedures 
In general, the procedures for meeting the objectives of post-construction runoff control are: 
a. Site Design Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
Site design BMPs are techniques and facilities that can be used within the proposed development to reduce the quantity of runoff and treat runoff in order to reduce the level of pollutants. Site design techniques include minimizing impervious areas and retaining native vegetation. Site design facilities include roof downspout infiltration systems, drywells and the utilization of pervious pavement where appropriate. If practical, runoff storage and treatment measures shall be spread throughout the site rather than being placed at a single stormwater collection point (end-of-pipe structure). 
b. Pretreatment Facilities 
Pretreatment of runoff is required prior to discharging to the site’s primary treatment facility or to any infiltration facility. The purpose of pretreatment is to remove large particles and debris from runoff in order to prevent clogging and minimize maintenance of any downstream treatment facility. Appropriate pretreatment facilities include deep sump catch basins, sediment traps, grass swales, vegetative buffers, gravel/riprap flow spreaders, underground detention systems, oil water separators and proprietary settling devices. Further downstream treatment utilizing primary treatment facilities is required after pretreatment. 
c. Primary Treatment Facilities 
Primary treatment of stormwater runoff is required at all points where stormwater discharges from the site into an existing stormwater conveyance system, watercourse, water body or wetland. Primary treatment facilities should be capable of capturing and treating the design water quality volume (WQV) or the design water quality flow (WQF) in accordance with the design procedures contained in the Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual. Examples of primary treatment facilities include infiltration trenches, infiltration basins, rain gardens, bio-filtration swales, surface or underground filtration systems, bio-retention systems and proprietary filtration devices. 





SECTION 4 
SITE PLANS 

LandscapeTreatment 
A. 	The following shall apply to all developments where a Site Plan approval is required: 
Where any commercial, industrial or multi-family use abuts a residential zone, a twenty-five (25) feet wide landscaped buffer strip shall be provided, on the lot used for such commercial, industrial or multifamily-use, extending the length of the property boundary, seeded and properly planted with trees and shrubs to insure a proper break between the two uses. The Commission may waive this requirement where the abutting residential zone does not contain a residential use; 
B. 	The site shall contain a minimum landscaped area in the aggregate 20% of the total Site. 
C. 	The site shall contain a landscaped area adjacent to the street which is not less than twenty (20) feet wide and extending along the entire linear front footage. This landscaped area shall be free of parking areas and planted with deciduous and coniferous trees located in clusters at a minimum rate of 1 tree per 25 feet of frontage. In addition to the trees, the frontage should include a variety of additional vegetation clusters utilizing local species of vegetation such as azalea, rhododendron and mountain laurel. The Commission may waive this requirement where existing slopes are present or where the developer demonstrates an excellence in building placement and landscape design; 
D. 	Where any commercial, industrial or multi-family use abuts a residential zone, a twenty-five (25) feet wide landscaped buffer strip shall be provided extending the length of the zone boundary, seeded and properly planted with trees and shrubs to insure a proper break between the two uses. The Commission may waive this requirement where the abutting residential zone does not contain a residential use; 
E. 	The Commission may require additional landscaping measures under unusual conditions or for noise abatement to prevent the depreciation of adjoining properties which may include fencing, walls, earth berms, mature plantings or a combination of measures; 
F. 	The Commission may reduce the landscape requirements by not more than 25% for excellence in building or open space design. The Commission shall consider, among other features, the site characteristics, compatibility of proposed structures with surrounding architectural types, quality of building materials and the size and quality of landscape materials. 


SECTION 4 SITE PLANS 
G. 	The Commission shall consider, and may require, a Visual Streetscape Buffer when reviewing applications for Site Plan or Special Permit. The depth of the Streetscape Buffer will vary based on the factors outlined herein, up to a maximum depth of 500 feet. The buffer area shall be preserved in a natural state, between the street line and new interior development, except as necessary to allow access and achieve proper sight line for vehicles exiting and/or entering the development. The street or driveway that will provide access and egress to the developable portion of the property, by crossing the streetscape buffer, shall be landscaped to visually ease the transition from the existing road to the proposed development. 
H. 	The streetscape buffer shall be permanently preserved through the creation of a conservation or similar easement and/or by deeding the fee or easement to an approved entity. In determining the applicability of a Streetscape Buffer the Commission shall consider the following: 
• 	
The setback of existing developments with the general area of the proposal. 

• 	
The condition of the streetscape within the area of the proposal. 

• 	
The potential to expand the streetscape buffer upon application of future developments. 

• 	
The impact that a streetscape buffer will have on the general aesthetics of the area. 

• 	
The depth of the property and the effect that such a requirement will have on the overall development potential of the site. 

• 	
The feasibility of developing the rear portion of the site. 

• 	
Factors that limit the developable areas of the site such as soils, wetlands and slopes. 

• 	
The extent of vegetative cover and the landform within the area of the streetscape buffer, before and after development. 


4.2.6 Natural Features 
Due regard shall be given to the preservation and potential enhancement of natural features, trees, streetscapes, scenic points, rock formations, and other assets of a community nature. All watercourses should remain in as natural a state as possible, and all land filing shall be subject to the landfill regulations of the Town. The developer shall preserve, insofar as possible, hardwood and evergreen trees that are not required to be removed by the building construction or public improvements.

8.6.4 COMPUTATIONS 
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
8.6.4.1 Computations of Area of Individual Signs 
The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display. This area shall include any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but shall not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets Zoning Regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. The area of a freestanding sign shall include all solid areas located between the posts. Where there is only one post, the sign area will be all areas, except the post. Where a post is not clearly distinguished from the sign, the entire area, including the posts shall be counted within the area of the sign. 
8.6.4.2 Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs 
The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. 
When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
8.6.4.3 Computation of Height 
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal building on the zone lot, whichever is lower.

8.11 	OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION OVERLAY ZONE 
8.11.1 	It is the policy of the Town of Granby to preserve open space in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. These Open Space and Recreation Requirements have been prepared from a regional perspective in an effort to preserve wildlife habitat, flora and fauna, while preserving for the citizens of the region an area in which to enjoy nature, with an opportunity to walk, jog, cross country ski, bicycle, horse ride, picnic, fish, wade, sit or otherwise spend time in a natural setting. In addition to these passive activities these requirements recognize the importance of areas which may be used for active recreational activities which include competitive sports and the importance of the Town's agricultural areas, which the Town strives to preserve, in an effort to provide locally grown fruits and vegetables, dairy products, trees, shrubbery and similar products. The Open Space and Recreation requirements outlined herein are based on the Town's Long Range, Master Plan, titled Preservation and Growth, A Plan of Conservation and Development and on studies and research which have identified agricultural and other important undeveloped areas throughout the town together with areas which can unite or link these areas. These "linkages" are formed by joining undeveloped and undevelopable land areas; including existing open spaces, areas with developmental restrictions, such as streams, wetlands and severe slopes and through the identification and plotting of existing trails. These areas are combined and identified on a map contained herein and entitled Granby's Open Space and Recreation Map. 
8.11.1.1 	All subdivision and zoning applications which include areas contained within the Open Space and Recreation Map, shall clearly identify those areas on a map of the property or properties which comprise the application, drawn at a scale of one inch equals one hundred feet (1"=100'). The areas outlined on the Open Space and Recreation map shall be directly transposed from said map to the 100-scale application map using a simple scaling process. 
8.11.1.2.1 	Development applications, which include, areas contained within the Open Space and Recreation Map; shall, where possible, set aside those areas for preservation. As provided within the Subdivision Regulations, Section 3.1.3.1, an area equal to twenty percent (20%) of the combined acreage of the lots shall be preserved for open space, and as outlined within Section 8.20 of the Zoning Regulations, Flexible Residential Development, fifty percent (50%) of the site shall be preserved for open space. Where applications for development contain areas within the Open Space and Recreation Map the required preservation of open space shall closely correspond with those areas outlined within the open space and recreation map. To aid in the final determination of the location of the open space a pre application meeting with the Planning and Zoning Commission is strongly recommended for all applications. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 

8.11.1.3 	All subdivision applications, which contain a total of 10 acres or more, shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.20 of the Zoning Regulations, Flexible Residential Development, where 50% or more of the total area to be subdivided is contained within the Open Space and Recreation Map. The Commission may waive this requirement where soil conditions clearly prevent a reduction in the minimum lot size outlined within the underlying zone, as required in Section 5 of these Regulations or where no new road construction is proposed. 
8.11.1.4 	All subdivision applications, which contain a total of 10 acres or more, shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.20 of the Zoning Regulations, Flexible Residential Development, where 25% or more of the total area to be subdivided is contained within the Open Space and Recreation Map and identified as agricultural land. A minimum of 25% of the required open space shall be the agricultural land area. The Commission may waive this requirement where soil conditions clearly prevent a reduction in the minimum lot size outlined within the underlying zone, as required in Section 5 of these Regulations or where no new road construction is proposed. 
8.11.1.5 	Where a proposed subdivision includes an area containing a significant stream or a stream linkage as shown on the Open Space and Recreation Map, the applicant shall, where possible, preserve as open space the stream and an area located within two hundred feet from either side of the center line of the stream. Streams under this section include, but are not limited to: the East and West branch of the Salmon Brook; Dismal Brook; Mountain Brooks; Higley Brook; Kendall Brook; Kendall Brook; Hungary Brook; Bissell Brook; Ring Brook; and Belden Brook. This preservation area will be required as part of the fifty percent (50%) FRD, or twenty percent (20%) conventional subdivision requirement. 
8.11.1.6 	Where a proposed development includes an area containing an existing trail or trail linkage, the trail and an area located within 50 feet from either side of the centerline of the trail shall be preserved. The Commission may agree to a relocation of any existing trail, provided the relocation is made in consideration of environmentally sensitive areas and is attached at both ends with the original trail. 
8.11.1.7 	Where a proposed development includes an area abutting an existing trail, which can be used for a future trail linkage, an area for a new or connecting trail shall be preserved, together with a land area of 50 feet from either side of the centerline of the proposed trail. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 

8.11.1.8 	Development applications shall preserve a location for the parking of vehicles within areas that can provide public access to existing and proposed open space, particularly those areas which provide access to new and existing trails and recreational areas. 
The preservation of these areas will be required as part of the fifty percent (50%) FRD, or twenty percent (20%) conventional subdivision requirement.

8.18  SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS  

8.18.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION 

The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-148(c)(7)(A) and in Title 8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Granby, Connecticut, does ordain as follows: 
8.18.2 FINDING OF FACT 
The flood hazard areas of the Town of Granby are subject to periodic flood inundation, which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community. 
The Town of Granby has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since February 15, 1980. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community’s role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to receive federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
8.18.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE 
It is the purpose of this Regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
. 	
To protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property; 

. 	
To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects; 

. 	
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 

. 	
To minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 

. 	
To minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain; 

. 	
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas; 

. 	
To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area; 

. 	
To prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; 

. 	
To ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions; and 

. 	
To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 


8.18.4 OBJECTIVES 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that: 
a. 	
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 

b. 	
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 

c. 	
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 

d. 	
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 

e. 	
Prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 


8.18.5 EFFECTIVE DATE OF REGULATIONS 
The effective date of these regulations is February 15, 1980, as amended to September 9, 2008.

8.18.9 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
8.18.9.1 General Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
1. 	New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
2. 	
New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 

3. 	
New construction, substantial improvements, and repairs to structures that have sustained substantial damage shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 

4. 	
New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water. 

5. 	
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HVAC ductwork, and other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing a structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE) to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This includes, but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical junction boxes, and circuit breaker boxes. 

6. 	
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 

7. 	
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges from the system into flood waters. 

8. 	
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 

9. 	
Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water. 

10. 	
In any portion of a watercourse that is altered or relocated, the flood carrying capacity must be maintained. Notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Inland Water Resources Division prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. 


SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
11. 	
If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone. 

12. 	
If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone. 

13. 	
Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas, which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure; shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality. 

14. 	
Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.

. 	
Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building and result in the loss of historic designation of the building. Variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause for a variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or disapproval of one’s neighbors. 

. 	
Variances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area, cause fraud on or 

victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, ordinances or regulations. Only hardships that are based on unusual or unique physical characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall quality to meet subsection (ii) above. Claims of hardship based on the structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances, are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance. 

. 	
No variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any increase in the 100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a “functionally dependent use” provided that there is good and sufficient cause for providing relief; and the variance does not cause a rise in the 100-year flood level within a regulatory floodway. The structure and other development must be protected by methods that minimize flood damages. 

. 	
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted, to be built; with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation. 


8.18.12 ENFORCEMENT 
Each Floodplain Permit shall authorize, as a condition of approval, the Director of Development or designated agents to make regular inspections of the subject property. The Director of Community Development or designated agents, are also authorized to inspect any property in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where it appears that violations of these regulations may be taking place. 
If the Director of Community Development finds that any person is undertaking any construction, substantial improvement, filling, or any other activity or maintaining a condition which in violation of these regulations, the Director of Community Development shall: 
. 	
Issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the subject property owner, ordering that the activity cease and ordering the property owner to either seed to obtain a Floodplain Permit prior to continuing with the activity or, if appropriate, ordering that all violations and/or obstructions be removed from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) immediately. 

. 	
Notify the Building Official and request that any floodplain permit(s) in force be revoked or suspended and that a stop work order be issued. 


SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
. 	
The Director of Community Development may suspend or revoke a Floodplain Development Permit if it is found that the applicant has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of work as set forth in the application including application plans. Prior to revoking any permit, the Director of Community Development shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct, which warrants the intended action. 

. 	
Failure to comply with any written order issued under this section shall be considered a violation of these regulations and is subject to the penalties described in Section 10.0. 

. 	
In the event violations or obstructions are not promptly removed from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the Director of Community Development may cause such removal and remediation work to be performed utilizing bond money held in escrow pursuant to Section 3.0 of this Regulation, or may direct the director of public works or appropriate agent to cause such work to be done and to place a lien against the property. 


8.18.13 	PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION 
Any violation of the provisions of this Regulation or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grant of variances or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Regulation or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined a penalty of [$250.00] per day [or imprisoned for not more than ten (10) days for each day of violation, or both,] and in addition shall pay all costs and reasonable legal fees involved in the case.

SPECIAL REGULATIONS 

8.20 FLEXIBLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (FRD). 
8.20 PRINCIPLE 
A flexible residential development arranges homes closer together in groups on smaller lots than those normally required by Zoning Regulation. FRD permits a reduction in lot size and a variation in shape and location without increasing the overall density, following the approval of a Special Permit in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in Section 8.20. 
8.20.1 Purpose 
Without increasing overall density, the purpose of FRD is to ensure that residential development in Granby, to the extent reasonably possible, preserves the natural features of the land including agricultural soils, wetlands, watercourses and the rural character of the community. In the interest of promoting these objectives, development shall be permitted on lots of lesser dimension than would otherwise be required by Section 5 of the Zoning Regulations if the conditions set forth in this section are met. 
8.20.2 Establishment 
It is hereby established that all land within the R30, R50, and R2A zones is eligible for a Special Permit for a FRD. Where the Commission approves a FRD the dimensional requirements of the underlying zones, outlined in Section 5 are hereby superseded in their entirety. 
8.20.3 Pre Application Conference 
The Commission strongly recommends that prior to the submission of an application for a FRD, the applicant initiate a pre application conference with the Commission and its staff to discuss the conceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan, or it's equivalent, for informal consideration by the Commission. The conceptual plan, or its equivalent, shall be designed to allow the Commission to make a general comparison between the FRD and a conventional development plan. 
Neither the pre application conference, the informal review of the conceptual plan, or its equivalent, nor the Commission's suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval of any portion of the application. 
8.20.4 Application 
The applicant for a Special Permit for Flexible Residential Development shall file with the Commission, in the Office of the Director of Community Development the following: 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
8.20.4.1 	A completed application form and fees for the Special Permit in accordance with Section 10.2.3 and Section 8.11 of these Regulations and in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations. 
8.20.4.2 	Nine (9) copies of the proposed development plan showing the information required by the Subdivision Regulations. 
8.20.4.3 	Any and all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with Section 8.2 of these Regulations and the information regarding site plans set forth in Section 4 of these Regulations. 
8.20.4.4 	As applicable, a summary or general description of the proposed bylaws, rules and Regulations of any association or corporation of lot owners within the proposed FRD; the proposed method by which all site utilities will be provided; the manner of ownership and maintenance of any private roadways, private or public facilities and any commonly owned real property rights, including Open Space, and a description of the proposed Open Space, including the method of proposed protection of each of those areas and the manner of preservation of the Open Space. 
8.20.5 	Conservation Commission Review 
The applicant for the FRD permit shall, simultaneously with the filing described in 8.20.4 above, file a copy of the application with the Conservation Commis­sion. The Conservation Commission may submit written comments to the Planning and Zoning Commission within forty-five (45) days of the filing date. Failure by the Conservation Commission to comment within forty-five (45) days shall be deemed lack of objection to the proposed development plan. 
8.20.6 	General Eligibility Requirements For A Special Permit 
8.20.6.1 	A FRD shall only be permitted in the R-30, R-50, and R2A zones. 
8.20.6.2 	A FRD shall consist of parcels of land containing no less than six (6) contiguous acres. 
8.20.6.3 	A FRD must provide for the preservation of Open Space in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations and the requirements of Section 8.11. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
8.20.7 	Open Space and Development Densities. 
8.20.7.1 	In all FRD's a minimum of 50% of the site shall be preserved as open space. At least 40% of this open space must be free of wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, flood plain-A zones, and slopes in excess of 20% that extend 50 linear feet or more. The Commission may modify the 40% requirements where the applicant can demonstrate that the percentage of wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, flood plain A zones, and excessive slopes that exist on the total property is equal to or greater than the percentage of such areas that is proposed for the open space area. 
8.20.7.2 	For the purposes of Section 8.20, Open Space is an area covered by a restriction, which permanently prohibits development in a manner consistent with the conditions and requirements set forth in Section 8.20. 
8.20.7.3 	The Commission, in its sole discretion, may permit non-commercial recreational uses within the open space, provided that such uses are not inconsistent with or harmful to the preservation of the restricted area or to the character of the neighborhood. The Commission may also permit activities and accessory structures necessary to support open space and agricultural uses. 
8.20.7.4 	The Commission may modify any application so as to designate Open Space in locations other than those proposed if such modification will further the conditions and requirements set forth in Section 8.20.9.1 and Section 8.11. 
8.20.7.5 	To determine the maximum number of lots permitted in a FRD, the total area to be developed shall be reduced by subtracting 75% of the wetlands, water­courses, water bodies, flood plain A zones, 100% of slopes in excess of 20% that extend 50 linear feet or more, 10% of the total area for roadways, and 100% of all designated use areas other than single family lots and open space. The remaining area shall be divided by the minimum lot size permitted in the zone, as outlined in Section 5, in which the subdivision is proposed. An increase in density may be only allowed as provided in Section 8.11. 
For Example: Total acreage minus 75% of wetlands, watercourses, water bodies and flood plain A zones, 100% of qualifying slopes, and 10% of the total acreage for roads = "X". "X" divided by the minimum lot size = number lots permitted. Not withstanding the number of lots produced by this formula, a FRD must not result in the creation of more lots than would occur in a standard subdivision. A conceptual standard design plan must be prepared for this purpose. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
8.20.7.6 	Minimum Lot Area, Frontage and Yard Requirements 
Minimum Lot Area 
R50 & R2A 20,000 sq. feet 
R30 15,000 sq. feet 
Minimum Lot Frontage 25 feet 
Minimum Front Yard 20 feet 
Minimum Side Yard 10 feet 
Minimum Rear Yard 20 feet 

8.20.7.7 	Community wells and community septic systems may be permitted within the Open Space, provided that they are in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 8.20.8, and provided that they are in accordance with the State of Connecticut Department of Health Regulations as administered by the Farmington Valley Health District and the State Department of Environmental Protection, as applicable. 
8.20.7.8 All parcels created by a flexible development plan shall be counted as buildable lots unless specifically restricted from residential use. 
8.20.7.9 	The Open Space shall not contain any portion of a buildable lot. 
8.20.8 	Design Guidelines

8.20.8.2 	That all or part of any existing forests, fields, pastures and other land in agricultural use be preserved and maintained, especially the preservation of land mapped as Class I or II farmland soils, together with sufficient buffer areas, of not less than 50 feet, to minimize conflict between residential and agricultural use. The Commission may waive the minimum buffer requirement where existing features exist which provide an acceptable buffer at less than the required minimum. 
8.20.8.3 	That consideration be given to the preservation, creation, and connection of areas used for wildlife habitat, recreational corridors and trails within subdivision open space. 
8.20.8.4 	That a provision be provided for pedestrian access between properties and for a perimeter design concept intended to facilitate the networking of trails for pedestrian and/or equine use to ensure recreational access to resource lands as provided for in the Subdivision Regulations. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 
8.20.8.5 	That the location of the open space areas be primarily in areas, which are contiguous to existing open space areas, or in areas of the site with the highest probability of connecting with future open space areas.

(10) feet lower than the average canopy height of trees on the ridge or hilltop. 
8.20.8.9 	That consideration be given to the protection of existing residential areas, which shall include the creation of sufficient buffer areas, of not less than 50 feet, to minimize conflict between existing residential use and the proposed FRD. The Commission may waive the minimum buffer requirement where existing features exist which provide an acceptable buffer at less than the required minimum or where the proposed lots, which abut the existing residential use, contain the minimum required area outlined in Section 5. 
8.20.9 	Requirements for the Open Space 
8.20.9.1 	All developments under the terms, conditions and requirements of these Regulations shall preserve open space land to serve one or more of the following purposes: 
1.

SPECIAL REGULATIONS 

8.28 	RESIDENTIAL LANDSCAPE BUSINESS 
8.28.0 	Purpose: 
It is the purpose of this regulation to permit the filing of a Special Permit application, within residential zones, for the operation of a Residential Landscape Business. Such use may only be permitted where the Commission determines that such use will be compatible within the specific residential area identified within the application. Residential Landscape Businesses are those that provide services in locations away from the business operator’s residence, performing a service for an off site client. 
While most of the actual landscape activity occurs off site, the business owner’s residential property may be approved for equipment storage, parking, material storage and a building or buildings for storage and plant propagation. 
By allowing such use by Special Permit, but not otherwise, the Commission provides an opportunity for a business owner to operate such use in conjunction with a residential property, while creating a mechanism for review, oversight and registration of the use. The following general guidelines place basic limitations on such use and establish criteria to aid the Commission in its evaluation of an application for Residential Landscape Business. It is understood that proposals for a Residential Landscape Business will vary in scope and that based on the specific location and surrounding uses, individual properties will be suited for differing levels of operation. It is further understood that some sites will simply not be suited at all for such use. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed use is compatible with the specific site and surrounding area and in compliance with the criteria set forth in Section 8.2. 
In accordance with the above purpose, the Commission may issue a Special Permit for a Residential Landscape Business, subject to the following requirements. 
8.28.1 	The property must be the primary residence of the owner of the Residential Landscape Business. 
8.28.2 	The scope of the Residential Landscape Business shall be appropriate to the size of the property and its proximity to neighboring residential uses. 
8.28.3 	Retail sales from the property are prohibited. 
SPECIAL REGULATIONS 

8.28.4 	No individual building, used for the business operation, shall exceed 2000 sq ft., and the total sq. footage of all such buildings shall not exceed 5,000 square feet. The design of any proposed building shall blend with the surrounding area. Any building that is visible from the street or from an adjacent residential structure shall be designed in the style of a traditional, wood frame barn. However, the major factor in determining the size of each building and the total size of all buildings shall be based on the compatibility with surrounding residential uses. 
8.28.5 	Greenhouses may be permitted, if found to be compatible with neighboring properties, provided the total area of all greenhouses shall not exceed 1,000 square feet per acre of property. Greenhouses may be used for over-wintering plants, propagation of plants and off-season equipment storage. Greenhouses are not subject to the limitations of Section 8.28.4. 
8.28.6 	The Commission may permit a maximum of six (6) employee vehicles to be parked on the property during business hours. Parking spaces shall be designed and placed in a manner that does not impact or detract from neighboring residential properties. Vehicles shall only be parked in approved designated locations. 
8.28.7 	Hours of operation shall be restricted based on the specific location, distance and screening from surrounding residential properties, and intensity of the proposed use. 
8.28.8 	The Commission shall limit vendor material deliveries based on the specific site, street and street access and potential impact on surrounding residential properties. 
8.28.9 	The Commission may permit the storage of landscape materials on the property, provided the materials are specifically identified on the site plan. Such plan shall show the location and maximum quantity of any material to be stored. 
When determining whether such material will be permitted on the site, the 
Commission shall consider the specific location and any environmental impact 
such storage may pose. 
Material may include bark mulch, topsoil, sand, base material, stone, brick, concrete block, peat moss, plants and timbers. Limited quantities of fertilizer may also be stored, provided they are in the manufacturer’s original sealed plastic bags, maximum weight of 80 lbs and placed inside of a building. 
8.28.10 	Landscape vehicles used in the operation may be stored on the property in areas specifically approved by the Commission, if the Commission determines that the property can accommodate such vehicles and that the storage of such vehicles is appropriate to the neighborhood. Such determination shall be based on the ability of the applicant to properly locate such vehicles and screen them from area residential properties and the street. All vehicles must be specifically listed and identified in the application. 
The on site bulk storage of gasoline, diesel fuel or other petroleum product for the use of the business is prohibited. 
The proposed use shall not create traffic, noise, odors or produce light that are incompatible with the residential character of the neighborhood.

g. 	
That truck access to and from the site will be so arranged as to minimize danger to traffic and nuisance to surrounding properties and that any access road used to service the operation will be provided with a dustless surface. 

h. 	
That feasible and prudent measure will be taken to minimize the nuisance of noise and dust. Upon review of the application the ZEO may require specific measures necessary to reduce the anticipated level of noise and dust. Upon inspection of the operation, the ZEO may also require further measures to reduce the level of noise and dust. Such noise measures may include limiting the use of engine braking assist systems such as “jake brakes”, adjusting the work areas during certain periods of the day, modifying work practices to limit back-up alarms, delaying the clearing of vegetation, requiring the creation of temporary earthen berms and other such measures as determined by the ZEO. Measures to control dust may include the regular watering of the site or specific areas of the site, the application of chlorides; the mulching of exposed areas; adjusting the scheduled clearing and grubbing; prioritizing the replanting of vegetation; early hydro-seeding and other such measures as determined by the ZEO. 

i. 	
That upon completion, the excavated or filled area will be graded so that no gradients in disturbed earth shall be steeper than a slope of 3-1 (horizontal/vertical), unless, after review by the Town Engineer it is determined that the soil condition can support a slope up to 2-1 (horizontal/vertical) and it is further determined that such slope is appropriate for the area. 

j. 	
That a layer of topsoil of a quality and depth approved by the Town Engineer will be spread over the disturbed area, except exposed rock surfaces, in accordance with the approved contour plan.

p. 	
All feasible and prudent steps shall be taken to assure that the operation continues to comply with the above criteria throughout the period of the operation. Upon a determination by the ZEO that the operation is not in compliance, the operation shall immediately cease and the operation shall not be allowed to continue until written approval is provided by the ZEO. Such written approval shall not be provided without a written documentation of the issues which led to the cessation of the operation and the resolution of the issue. Any operation that continues following a notice to cease shall be subject to the remedies and sanctions provided by the Connecticut General Statutes and Section 10.1 of the Granby Zoning Regulations.

SECTION 3 
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 
AND DESIGN STANDARDS 

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS 
Subdivisions and resubdivisions, including related streets, drainage and other improvements required by these Regulations, shall be planned, designed and constructed in accordance with the standards hereinafter specified. 
3.1.1 	Plan of Development Subdivisions shall be planned and designed in general conformity with the Town of Granby Plan of Development, adopted by the Commission under Chapter 125 of the Connecticut General Statutes 
3.1.2 	Subdivision Name -The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by these Regulations. The principal road in the subdivision shall bear the same name as the subdivision and shall be taken from the "Suggestions for Street and/or Development Names" prepared by the Salmon Brook Historical Society. 
3.1.3 Dedication of Open Space 
Granby is a community located on the western fringe of the more densely developed suburban and urban communities to the south and east. Granby serves as the transition between those communities and the very rural areas west of Granby. The Town of Granby, through its open space policies and its preservation efforts continues to maintain large areas of natural habitat for flora and fauna and significant agricultural areas. These areas must not become islands of preservation, isolated by thoughtless independent developments. Agricultural use and wildlife habitat cannot adequately survive in isolation and must be linked and supported through the continuous preservation of additional land areas. Therefore, proposed developments must preserve land areas at a level and in areas that are consistent with the type of community that Granby is today. Proposed developments must not alter the basic character of the community by siting developments in a manner that will negatively impact the preservation of the Town 
s open space and agricultural areas. As Granby is unique, so too are its regulations, design and preservation standards. It is only through these efforts that the Town of Granby can succeed in maintaining within this community the open spaces, habitat and agricultural areas that serve the local community, the region and the State of Connecticut. 
In accordance with Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes and consistent with the State Plan of Conservation and Development and the Granby Plan of Conservation and Development, no subdivision of land shall be made unless proper provisions have been made for the preservation of Open Space. 
10 

3.1.3.1 	All subdivision applications shall include a dedication of open space equal to or greater than twenty (20) percent of the combined acreage of the lots proposed within the subdivision. At least fifty (50) percent of this open space shall be preserved as Useable Open Space. Useable Open Space shall contain no wetlands, as defined by the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations, no excessive slopes (greater than 20%), and no storm water detention facilities. The Commission may waive this requirement and permit the required open space area to include areas of wetlands and excessive slopes where the total area of the property to be developed contains more than 25% of such areas. In all cases the proportion of wetlands and excessive slopes that is included within the open space shall not exceed the proportion that exists within the total area to be developed. Useable Open Space must be permanently preserved by deeding the land, to the Town of Granby, Granby Land Trust, McLean Game Refuge, State Department of Environmental Protection or other approved nonprofit or preservation organization. The applicant shall provide documentation that the receiver of the open space, as outlined above, agrees to take ownership of the open space. 
3.1.3.2 	The location of the Useable Open Space shall be designed in accordance with one or more of the following factors as appropriate to the site, bearing in mind that some factors conflict with others. 
3.1.3.2.1 	Where new roads are proposed, open space is located so as to create a buffer between the existing Town/State road(s) and the proposed lots. Open space that is preserved as part of the Visual Streetscape Buffer (Section 3.1.4.1.5) may be counted as a part of the open space preservation requirement and as Useable Open Space where it complies with the requirements of Section 3.1.3.1. 
3.1.3.2.2 	The open space is suitable for public active recreational use. 
3.1.3.2.3 	The open space is located to preserve such natural features as scenic vistas, ridge tops, significant tree groves and environmentally sensitive areas. 
3.1.3.2.4 	The open space is located in areas to preserve significant man made features such as stonewalls or historic structures. 
3.1.3.2.5 	The open space is located so as to preserve agricultural lands. 
3.1.3.2.6 	The open space is located in areas which connect existing open space, or areas with the greatest potential for future open space, and facilitate recreational and green space corridors and/or trails. 
3.1.3.2.7 
3.1.3.2.8 	The open space extends beyond the wetland boundary of a stream or watercourse a minimum of 100 feet on either side. 
3.1.3.2.9 	The Commission may waive the above requirements for the preservation of all or part of the Open Space under one of more of the following circumstances: 
Where the primary purpose of the subdivision is to facilitate a transfer of ownership 
of an existing building or buildings that are located on a previously developed 
property; 
Where the subdivision is for conservation or non-residential purposes, or; 
Where the preservation of open space is found to be unnecessary due to the unique 
and unforeseen nature of the application. 

11 

3.1.3.3 	In all cases, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine where the usable open space will be located, based on the needs and the benefits to the community and the environment and in basic conformance with the Town s Plan of Conservation and Development. 

3.1.3.4 	The additional open space area that is not identified as Usable Open Space, as defined herein, shall be preserved in one (1) or more of the following ways: 
3.1.3.4.1 	Deeded in fee to an approved entity as identified for the Usable Open Space in Section 3.1.3.1 above; 
3.1.3.4.2 	Deeded in the form of a conservation easement to an approved entity as identified for the Usable Open Space in Section 3.1.3.1 above; 
3.1.3.4.3 	Deeded in fee or in the form of a conservation easement to a home owners' association; 
3.1.3.4.4 	Deeded in the form of an agricultural easement for the exclusive use of crop production to an approved user; 
3.1.3.4.5 	Deeded in the form of a scenic easement to an approved preservation organization; 
3.1.3.4.6 	Where the open space (that which is not a part of the Usable Open Space) is preserved in the form of a conservation easement or similar restriction, the restriction shall be granted in perpetuity exclusively for the conservation and preservation of open space for the enjoyment of the general public. Except as otherwise set forth within the approval, prohibited within conservation areas shall be the following: 

The construction or the placing of buildings, roads, parking areas or other impermeable surfaces, signs or other advertising materials, utilities or other structures on or above the ground, except those structures used for agricultural purposes and approved by the Commission; 

The dumping or placing of soil or other substances or materials as landfill, or the dumping or placing of trash, waste or other unsightly and offensive materials; 

The excavation, dredging, or removal of loam, peat, gravel, soil, rock, or other substances; 

All uses excepting passive outdoor recreational uses, providing the land remains predominantly in its natural condition; 

All activities which are detrimental to drainage, flood control, water conservation, erosion control, or soil conservation; 

Any manipulation or alteration of natural watercourses, marshes, or other water bodies and any other acts or uses detrimental to the retention of said land in its natural and scenic and open condition. 

The use of motorized recreational vehicles. 
3.1.3.5 	The Commission may reduce the open space area that is not identified as Usable Open Space under the following conditions: 
12 

3.1.3.5.1 Where prime agricultural land with class 1 or 2 soils is preserved, as outlined in the soil survey of Hartford County, CT, report by Arthur E. Shearin, Soil Conservation Service and David E. Hill, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. 
3.1.3.5.2 	Where affordable housing is proposed. 
3.1.3.5.3 	Where solar access and other energy conservation methods are employed. 
3.1.3.5.4 	Where less then six (6) lots are proposed. 
3.1.3.5.5 	Where no new road construction is proposed. 
3.1.3.5.6 	Where the proposed average lot size is 100% larger than the lot size required under Section 5 of the Zoning Regulations. 
3.1.3.6 	All applicants are strongly encouraged to appear before the Commission for a pre­application discussion of their proposed open space plan, prior to the submission of the complete application. Requests for a pre-application discussion shall be made in writing to the Director of Community Development and shall be placed on the earliest possible agenda of the Commission. 
3.1.3.7 A site improvement plan must be prepared in any case where improvements are proposed in public or private open space land. 
3.1.3.8 	There shall be no depositing, dumping or storage of waste or other natural or man-made materials, supplies or equipment on any subdivision land designated as open space without the prior approval of the Town Engineer and in accordance with State law. 
3.1.3.9 	Land to be used as public or private open space shall be left in a condition for the purpose intended. Where directed by the Commission, the applicant shall remove undesirable vegetation and debris. Open space that is to be used for recreation shall be graded and seeded to dispose of surface water. In general, wooded areas and areas along the edges of waterways areas shall be left undisturbed. 
3.1.3.10 	Security deposits, as outlined in Section 7, which provide for the completion of public improvements shall be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of required improvements to public or private open space areas. 
3.1.3.11 	In the event that the dedication and the location of the open space is deferred, due to a phased development, that fact shall be stated on the mylar and a cash bond or other security shall be established to assure the future dedication of open space as required by the subdivision. 
3.1.3.12 	The total area of required open space may be broken up into separate areas of not less than one (1) acre, provided the total of all areas is equal to or greater than the minimum requirement of Section 3.1.3.1. The Commission may waive the one (1) acre minimum when the future development of adjoining land makes smaller areas feasible or where the area is a continuation of a stream protection area, existing or future open space corridor or other natural features. 
13 

3.1.3.13 	When a tract is to be developed in stages, the Commission may allow the preservation of open space to be included in any of the phases provided the necessary total amount of open space is preserved as required by the Commission upon the completion of the development of the entire tract and provided the open space meets all requirements of the Commission. The Commission shall require a bond as per Section 7 to assure the preservation of the total area of the open space proposed for the subdivision. 
3.1.3.14 	All Useable Open Space shall abut or have direct access to a street through a right­of-way dedicated to public use. In acceptable circumstances, such as where the proposed Useable Open Space abuts an existing open space, the Commission may reduce or waive this requirement. 
3.1.3.15 	Fees in Lieu of Open Space Dedication 
As set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission may authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the Town of Granby, or may approve a combination of paying a fee to the Town of Granby and preserving the land in accordance with this section, in lieu of the full requirement to preserve open space otherwise required by these Regulations. In considering any land to be transferred under this Section, the Commission shall follow the procedures outlined in the Connecticut General Statues, as amended. The procedure is set forth below: 
The applicant shall provide the Commission with a narrative setting forth the proposal to pay a fee, or pay a fee and transfer land, in lieu of the full open space dedication as set forth above. 
The Commission shall determine whether to accept the proposal of the applicant, to recommend an alternate fee, a different combination of dedication and fee, or to require a dedication only. 
If fees in lieu of open space are to be allowed, the Commission, through the Director of Community Development, and the applicant shall first jointly select an appraiser to determine the fair market value of land proposed to be subdivided. The applicant shall be responsible for all of the appraisal fees and expenses. At the option of the applicant, the applicant may request that the Commission agree to establish the fair market value based on the value noted on the Assessor Property Card, for land only, as adjusted for inflation, if any, by the Town Assessor. 
The final fair market value of the land shall be determined by the Commission, when and if, the fee in lieu of open space is accepted. 
The payment, or combination of payment and the fair market value of the land transferred for preservation, shall be equal to ten percent of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision, except that the Commission may accept a payment of 6% where only one new parcel is created and 8% where two new parcels are created. 
The method of payment of any fees under this Section shall be one of the following two options: 
The applicant, at his option, may submit the entire fee in one lump sum prior to the filing of subdivision mylars with the Town Clerk; or 
14 

The applicant may elect to submit a fraction of such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved building lots in the subdivision, no later than the time of the sale of each approved building lot; and a notation describing this requirement shall be placed on the final subdivision map filed in the Town Clerk's office. If this option is chosen, the applicant shall submit a bond or other security acceptable to the Director of Community Development, equal to the full amount of fee required, prior to the filing of the subdivision maps in the Town Clerk's office. 
Fees submitted under this section shall be deposited by the Town in a fund, which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes. The disbursement of such fees shall be approved by the Commission and shall be consistent with the Plan of Conservation and Development. Any required fees shall be paid to the Town prior to the release of any subdivision bond. 
3.1.3.16 	The open space requirements of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a, equal to twenty per cent or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. 
3.1.4. Vegetation Preservation/Planting Plan (VPPP) 
3.1.4.1 	All applications for subdivision shall include an overall VPPP plan. The plan must include as applicable the following: 
3.1.4.1.1 	The boundary of wooded areas located on the site. 
3.1.4.1.2 	The area of the subdivision to be cleared, providing for a minimum of three (3) trees within the front yard of each lot to be planted or preserved. Each tree shall have a minimum caliper of three and one-half (3.5) inches. 
3.1.4.1.3 	Where the proposed subdivision borders an existing agricultural use, the common boundary shall contain a buffer area of at least fifty (50) feet. Said buffer shall be designed to minimize the potential for conflict between the uses. Dense vegetation, earth berms, fencing and the use of existing natural features; such as, streams, wetlands, existing woodlands, slopes, stone walls, etc., shall be utilized in the design of buffers. 
3.1.4.1.4 	The interior area of all cul-de-sacs shall be landscaped in a manner that will require little or no future maintenance. The use of native trees, shrubs, vegetative ground cover and boulders shall be preferred to the establishment of grassy areas. 
15 

3.1.4.1.5 	A visual streetscape buffer shall be established whenever subdivisions are proposed which have access or create new lots on any street, existing within the Town on 1/1/2000. The streetscape buffer shall stretch along the entire street frontage of the property, adjacent to the through street. The streetscape buffer shall extend from the street line, back into the property to a minimum depth equal to the lesser of 50% of the depth (as measured, perpendicular from the street line to the furthest point of the rear property line), or a distance of 500 feet. The depth of the buffer shall be computed based on the configuration of the entire parcel, prior to subdivision. Within the streetscape buffer all existing vegetation shall be preserved, the removal and depositing of earth and other materials shall be prohibited, and all construction activity shall be prohibited, except as specifically approved by the Commission. 
Where new streets will provide access and egress to the property by crossing the streetscape buffer, the area of the entrance shall be landscaped to visually ease the transition from the existing town road to the proposed subdivision. The buffer area shall be established as outlined above, and preserved between the street line and new interior subdivision lot(s), except as necessary to achieve proper sight line for vehicles exiting and/or entering the development. The Commission may require the use of natural features such as wetlands, existing woodlands, slopes, stonewalls, etc., in the design of the buffer. The development shall also provide for the preservation of existing historic structures, barns, period fencing, or other significant features where they exist within the area of the buffer. Where natural, historical or other significant features are absent, earth berms and boulders may be used in conjunction with the planting of native trees and shrubs. 
The Commission may reduce the depth of the streetscape buffer where conditions exist 
which, while preserving the streetscape, lessen the required depth of the buffer. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to: 
the vertical and horizontal alignment of the roads, 
the quality and quantity of the existing vegetation, 
the quality and quantity of proposed vegetation, 
the existence of natural and geological features which serve as a buffer, 
the existence of man made and historical features which serve as a buffer. 

The streetscape buffer shall be permanently preserved through the creation of a conservation or similar easement, shown on the approved subdivision map and/or by deeding the fee or easement to an approved entity. 
3.1.4.2 	The new road and existing rights-of-way shall only be cleared of existing vegetation as outlined in the VPPP to provide for safety, drainage and construction. 
3.1.4.3 	Maintenance of the visual integrity of hilltops and ridge lines shall be maintained by designing the development so that building silhouettes will be below the ridgeline or hilltop or, if the area is heavily wooded, so that the building silhouette will be at least ten 
(10) feet lower than the average canopy height of trees on the ridge line or hilltop. 
3.2 	DESIGN AND LOCATION 
3.2.1 	Lot Arrangement -The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning Regulations and Health Codes and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved street. 
3.2.2 	Double Frontage (Through Lots) -Double Frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
16 

3.2.3 	Solar Access The developer must demonstrate to the Commission that she/he has considered, in the locations of the lots, using passive solar energy techniques which would not significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer after tax credits, subsidies and exemptions. As used in this subsection, passive solar energy techniques mean site design techniques that maximize heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide thermal storage within a building during the heating season and minimize heat gain and provide for natural ventilation during the cooling season. 
The site design techniques shall include, but not be limited to: (1) house orientation; (2) street and lot layout; (3) vegetation; (4) natural and man-made topographical features; and (5) protection of solar access within the development. See Connecticut General Statutes (CGS), Section 8-25 (b). 
3.2.4 	Lot Arrangements on Existing Streets -Lots proposed for existing streets shall, in addition to meeting other applicable standards of these Regulations, be arranged to conform with the following:

The Commission may require that the title to all land between the center of the road and the front property lines of the subdivision lots be dedicated to the Town of Granby in accordance with the legal requirements for such a procedure. 
3.2.4.2 	Where the development of a lot fronting on an existing street will cause drainage problems in that street, the developer shall install drains in the street or make such other provision as may be necessary to correct the condition. 
3.2.5 Lot Dimensions -Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning Regulations except where the Commission approves a site-specific flexible residential development (see Section 5). Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to street lines. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit the minimum lot frontage on each street. 
3.2.6 	Lot Square -The shape of all lots shall be such that the lot can fit a square having sides equal to the minimum frontage required (for the particular zone where subdivision is proposed) minus twenty-five (25) feet, with one side of the square placed along the required lot frontage as close to parallel to the road as possible. This requirement is not applicable to subdivisions designed under the Flexible Residential Development guidelines of Section 8.20 of the Zoning Regulations. 
3.2.7 	Contiguous Developable Area -All lots created through subdivision or resubdivision shall contain a contiguous developable area equal to at least 40,000 square feet in the R2A zone; 35,000 square feet in the R50 zone; and 30,000 square feet in the R30 zone. 
3.2.7.1 	For the purpose of this Regulation, a contiguous developable area shall be defined as an uninterrupted contiguous area, which does not contain wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, or areas with slopes in excess of 20% that extend 50 linear feet or more. The contiguous developable area may be reduced by 50% when both public water and public sewer are available. Where Flexible Residential Development applications are proposed the minimum Contiguous Developable Area shall be reduced to 20,000 square feet in the R2A zone; 17,500 square feet in the R50 zone; and 15,000 square feet in the R30 zone. The 50% reduction for public water and public sewer shall not apply to FRD applications. 
17 

3.2.7.2 	The lot development plan shall demonstrate that: 
a. 	
The primary structure can be accommodated within the Contiguous Developable area. 

b. 
The primary structure, as its is placed within the Contiguous Developable Area, can be accessed from a public street. The primary structure shall be constructed within the Contiguous Developable Area, except where extraordinary circumstances are identified that justify the location of the structure elsewhere on the site. 


3.2.8 	Electric Power, Telephone, and Other Cable Systems: 
3.2.8.1 	Electric power, telephone, and other cable systems shall be placed underground in all residential subdivisions; except that in those portions of a subdivision adjacent to an existing Town road, the existing electric power, telephone and cable system facilities on such road may be used. 
3.2.8.2 	The whole or any part of an electric power, telephone, or cable system may be permitted above ground on new roads whenever and to the extent that the Commission has determined that safe underground installation is not feasible because of soil or water conditions or other natural or man-made conditions. In these cases, utility poles shall be seven (7) feet from the right-of-way lines. 
3.2.9 	Monuments -Permanent reference monuments shall be placed within the subdivision as required herein. 
3.2.9.1 	Town road right-of-way mere stones, perimeter boundary and lot corners shall conform to Class A-2 of Code of Recommended Practice for Standards of Accuracy of Maps, as amended. A registered land surveyor in the State of Connecticut will certify to vertical/horizontal correctness.

Horizontal coordinates will be from the Granby co-ordinate system with tie-in requirements as above. Vertical control will be datum National Geodetic Vertical Data (NGVD). The markers used for horizontal and vertical control shall consist of a mere stone with a brass cap. 
3.2.9.3 	A registered land surveyor shall certify to the horizontal and vertical accuracy of the points set in accordance with Class A-2 of the Code of Recommended Practice for Standards of Accuracy of Maps prepared by the Connecticut Association of Land Surveyors, January 1984. 
3.2.9.4 	Highway lines shall be monumented by standard mere stones at all points, (Point of Curve, Point of Radius, and Point of Radius Curve). The maximum distance between highway mere stones will be 500 feet on tangent or curved sections of the highway line. Highway mere stones will be set to the accuracy of Class A-2 of the Connecticut Association of Land Surveyors. The proposed highway line will be tied into existing highway lines by distance and bearing. Additional locations shall be shown on the highway line as required by the Town Engineer. 
3.2.9.5 	Unless otherwise required by the Town Engineer, all lot corners shall be permanently located by metal pins at least 3/4 inch in diameter and thirty (30) inches in length.

4.16.6.7  The Commission may modify the thickness of the roadway sub base and base courses, in accordance with a recommendation of the Town Engineer and based on the suitability of the existing site materials.  
4.16.7  A written agreement, which provides for the permanent, cooperative, maintenance of the private street, by the owners of the lots that are served by the private street, shall be prepared and filed in the office of the Town Clerk. Such agreement may not be amended without the prior approval of the Commission. The agreement shall require that the developer is responsible for the maintenance and insurance of the private road and all associated costs. The developer s responsibility for the private road shall continue until such time that the ownership of the private road is transferred to the owners of the lots that are served by the private road, which shall not occur until such time that the Town deems the subdivision complete, as demonstrated by the final release of security. Should the developer fail to complete the required improvements, the Commission may use the security (bonded funds) to complete the remaining work. If more than 80% of the lots have been sold, then, at the discretion of the Commission and in cooperation with the homeowners, the security may be released to the owners of the lots served by the private street for the purpose of completing the required improvements.  
4.16.8  Private streets shall not serve as a connector between two or more public streets.  
4.16.9  Private streets shall be named in the same manner as public streets and in accordance with Section 3.1.2.

SECTION 1
TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an
indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the
citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses
are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface
and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and
erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the
existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland
wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of
destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or
removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of
structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and
eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had,
and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment
and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil
the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic,
historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now
and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and
watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses,
disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the
health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the
purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making
provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the
inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and
pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the
highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage
from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial
aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural
habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution;
protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation,
economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and
values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the
dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by
providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of
the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and
ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of
such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit
and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Regulations of the Town of Granby."
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission of the Town of Granby

matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions
thereof, the Commission shall take into consideration all relevant facts and
circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses;
b. the applicant’s purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to,
the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no
environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses;
25
SECTION 10
CONSIDERATION FOR DECISION
c. the relationship between the short term and long-term impacts of the
proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands
or watercourses;
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources
which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the
extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect,
enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which
may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity
including, but not limited to, measures to: (1) prevent or minimize pollution
or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing
environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore,
enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or
the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the
proposed regulated activity; and
f. impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses
outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities
associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity
which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which
may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application, which received a public hearing pursuant to a
finding by the Commission that the proposed activity may have a significant
impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the

alternative does not exist. In making this finding the Commission shall
consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection 10.2 of this
section. The finding and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record
in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that
there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated
activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the
Commission shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives
which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be
construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to
the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
26
SECTION 10
CONSIDERATION FOR DECISION
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands and watercourses” includes
aquatic, plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2)
“habitats” means areas or environments in which an organism or biological
population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands Commission shall not deny or condition an

life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics
of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the
Commission shall base its decision on the record of that hearing.
Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not
be considered by the Commission in its decision.
10.8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice
pursuant to subsection 7.11c of these regulations, the holder of the
restriction may provide proof to the inland wetlands agency that granting of
the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction. Upon a finding
that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction, the inland
wetlands agency shall not grant the permit approval.
10.9
10.10
In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations, (1) the party
holding the conservation or preservation restriction, other than a state
agency that holds such restriction may, not later than fifteen days after
receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland
wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency
relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall reverse the permit
approval upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of
such restriction; or (2) the state agency that holds such restriction may, not
later than thirty days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an
appeal with the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations
of such agency relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall
immediately reverse such permit approval if the commissioner of the state
agency that holds such restriction certifies that the land use authorized in
such permit violates the terms of such conservation or preservation
restriction.
Nothing in subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations shall be
construed to prohibit the filing of a permit application or to require such
written notice when the activity that is the subject of such permit application
will occur on a portion of property that is not restricted under the terms of
such conservation or preservation restriction.
27
SECTION 11
DECISION PROCESS AND PERMIT

provided the total extension of all such periods shall not be for longer than
sixty-five (65) days, or may withdraw the application. The failure of the
Commission to act within any time period specified in this subsection, or any
extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of the
application. An application deemed incomplete by the Commission shall be
withdrawn by the applicant or denied by the Commission.
11.3 The Commission shall state upon its record the reasons and bases for its
decision.
11.4 The Commission shall notify the applicant and any person entitled to such
