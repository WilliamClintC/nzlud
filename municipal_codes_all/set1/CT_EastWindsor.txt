Standards for Streams Without Established Base Flood Elevations, Floodways and/or Flood Mapping
1. The Zoning Official shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, including data developed pursuant to Section 2.4.4 of the Subdivision Regulations as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Community's FIRM meet the standards of these regulations. If such data is not readily available from existing sources the Zoning Official may require the applicant to provide such data certified by a professional engineer.
2. In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than 1 foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
Town of East Windsor Zoning Regulations Page 90
3. The Zoning Official may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the Town's request or not), the Town shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than 1 foot at any point along the watercourse.
b. Specific Standards
The following provisions shall apply in all areas of special flood hazard A1-30, AE, and AH zones where base flood elevations data has been provided.
1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure: shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the level of the base flood elevation.
2. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure: shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall a.) be flood-proofed to one foot above base flood elevation so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water: b.) have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of the subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Official.
3. New Construction or Substantial Improvements with fully enclosed area below: For either commercial or residential properties, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following criteria: a minimum of two openings having a net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
4. Compensatory Storage: The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction, or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been granted from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100 year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
5. Equal conveyance: Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic
Town of East Windsor Zoning Regulations Page 91
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
6. Above Ground Oil Tanks: Above-ground oil tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
7. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone: If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure that extend into a more restrictive flood zone.
8. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water: New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water.
9. Subdivision Proposals: Require the following:
a. Base Flood elevation data for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser;
b. Review subdivision proposals to assure that:

ii. All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
iii. Adequate drainage is provided.
11. Recreational Vehicles: All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1- 30, AH and AE and must be either:
i. on the site for fewer than 30 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
ii. meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of a manufactured home. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on it’s wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
12. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
1. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development shall be prohibited unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a licensed professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences located in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. When utilizing data other than that provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a regulatory floodway must be adopted which is designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
c. Variance Prohibited
No variances may be granted from this Section of the Regulations.

2.2 TOWN PLAN AND ZONING
The proposed subdivision shall conform to the town Plan of Development and to Zoning Regulations. Where strict conformity to the Subdivision Regulations would cause undue hardship or injustice to the owner of the land, a subdivision plan substantially in conformity with the Regulations may be approved by the Commission provided that the spirit of the Regulations and public convenience and welfare not be adversely affected.

2.4 RESERVE STRIPS
In general, no reserve strip controlling access to land dedicated, or to be dedicated, to public use will be permitted. Reserve strips of land, which may prove to be untaxable for improvements, shall not be permitted.
-4-
2.5 WATER, SEWER SYSTEMS (AMENDED 3/13/90, EFFECTIVE 4/1/90)
No subdivision shall be approved until the health officer of the North Central Health Department has approved the layout and design of on-site water service and sewage systems and disposal methods. When public utilities are available, no subdivision shall be approved until: 1) it is demonstrated that the WPCA has available capacity to serve the system and has approved the sewer system layout, and 2) the water company has verified the availability of public water service to the site. When deemed necessary, the Town Engineer shall review construction requirements.
2.6 DEVELOPABLE LAND (AMENDED 10/1/89)
That portion of a parcel of land deemed to be appropriate for development by the Commission after deducting those portions of the parcel that have slopes in excess of 15% or are in areas of Special Flood Hazard as defined in Section 19.2.3 of the East Windsor Zoning Regulations. Only land that is so determined to be developable can be used in calculating the minimum lot area required for the district.
2.7 STREET TREES
Street trees, selection of which shall be approved by a registered Landscape Architect or by the municipal official whose duties include supervision of street trees, shall be incorporated into the plans and planted as construction of the subdivision progresses.
2.8 PERFORMANCE BOND
Before final approval of a subdivision, there shall be filed a performance bond in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the construction of streets and other improvements, approved as to form and sureties by the Town Attorney, and conditioned on the completion of such within two (2) years of the date of the bond. Conditional approval may be given, in lieu of a bond, if the Commission shall be satisfied that no lots shall be sold until the specified streets, together with the necessary sanitary improvements, are satisfactorily constructed within two (2) years of the date of such conditional approval.
2.9 OPEN SPACE
The Planning Commission may require the provision and reservation of open space in any subdivision as a condition of subdivision approval. Specific requirements are outlined in Section 7. (Effective 6-17-06)
-5-
2.10 ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
Any subdivider submitting a Final Plan for approval must demonstrate through plans, maps or narrative statement that consideration has been given to using passive solar energy design techniques which maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide for natural ventilation during the cooling season. Such design techniques include, as an example: 1) house orientation, 2) street and lot layout, 3) vegetation, 4) natural and manmade topographical features, and 5) protection of solar access within the development.
2.11 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
The following improvements shall be required in all subdivisions except where waived by a specific resolution of the Commission:
2.11.1 Curbs, storm sewers and pavement between the edge of the existing pavement and the new curb and pavement between the edge of existing streets which bound or intersect the proposed subdivision.
2.11.2 Street signs, monuments, driveway aprons, streetlights, loam and seeding and shade trees;
2.11.3 The Commission may require sidewalks on thoroughfares, in pedestrian easements, on local streets in the vicinity of existing or planned schools and playgrounds and in other places deemed proper by the Commission for the public necessity and safety.
2.11.4 Fire hydrants as necessary.
2.11.5 Such improvements shall be installed in accordance with Town, State or utility company standards.
2.12 INSPECTION PROCEDURE
All subdivision improvements, to be dedicated to the Town, shall be inspected by the Commission, or such agent as may be designated by the Commission. The developer shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to the first stage until such inspection has been made by the Commission, or its approved agent, on the preceding stage and approval, in writing, has been obtained on the preceding stage. At least forty-eight (48) hours notice, excluding Sundays and Holidays, shall be given by the developer to the Commission or its appointed agent, for each inspection.
2.13 STAGED DEVELOPMENT
The Commission may require a large subdivision to be developed in stages to promote the purposes of Section 8-23 and 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
-6-
2.14 ENFORCEMENT
These regulations shall be enforced under, and any violations shall be subject to, penalties set forth in the Connecticut General Statutes or any ordinance enacted by the Town. The building official and zoning enforcement official may withhold certificates of occupancy if these regulations are not adhered to.
2.15 WAIVER OF PROVISIONS (AMENDED 2/26/02, EFFECTIVE 3/19/02)
The Commission may waive certain provisions and requirements of the regulations by a three-fourths vote of the Commission and no waiver may be granted unless specifically authorized by these regulations. If a waiver has a major and significant adverse effect on adjacent property or public health and safety, it shall not be granted.
2.16 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
All land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for its intended purposes without danger to healthy or the public safety, that proper provision will be made for water, drainage and sewerage and, in areas contiguous to wetlands, brooks, rivers or other areas subject to flooding, that proper provision will be made for protective flood control measures, that in places deemed proper by the Commission, open space for parks and playgrounds will be established and, if the Commission shall have adopted a town Plan Of Development affecting the area of the proposed subdivision, that any proposed street shown on the subdivision plan is in harmony with existing or proposed streets shown on said plan, especially in regard to safe intersections with such streets.
2.17 AGRICULTURE BUFFER ZONES (AMENDED 12/13/2011; EFFECTIVE 1/1/2012)
Buffers adjacent to actively farmed land shall be established in residential subdivisions. Said buffer strips, when required shall be no less than one hundred (100) feet in width, but may be lessened through a waiver. The setback shall be determined based on the type of agriculture or farm use, the topography, existing vegetation and the proposed design and planting of such strip.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer, subject to approval by the Commission, to provide an effective barrier that will reasonably protect adjacent residential living areas from dust and spray drift. It shall be the responsibility of individual lot owners where such buffers are established on their lots, to maintain the buffer in accordance with the designed intent. Such responsibility shall be specifically noted on the filed subdivision plan and in the deeds of affected lots. Where a buffer strip is part of a common open space, the responsibility for maintenance will be assumed by a Homeowners Association or any other arrangement that is acceptable to the Commission.
In addition, the following statement shall be noted on the subdivision plan: “This property abuts or is in proximity of an active agricultural or farming operation
- 7 -
which is a permitted zoning use, and protected in accordance with Section 19a – 341(a) of the Connecticut General Statutes. Agricultural operations sometimes emit noise, run-off, odor, dust or chemical spray drift during either the day or night that may be annoying or irritants to some people”.
If abutting actively farmed land comes under development, then these requirements shall be voided. New farm activity abutting existing residential development is exempt from agricultural buffers.
- 8 -
SECTION 3: PROCEDURES
3.1 SUBMISSION OF FORMAL FINAL PLANS
The subdivider shall submit to the Town Planner a formal application for subdivision approval and any final plans for a proposed subdivision at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission. In the period between the submission of the final plans and the meeting with the Commission, the Town Planner shall refer the application to the appropriate Town Officials and Commissions to evaluate the proposal, review the final plans, and compile their comments and recommendations regarding the subdivision, including bonding requirements.
3.2 PUBLIC HEARINGS
Before the final plan shall have been approved or disapproved, the Commission may hold a public hearing on the plan. No plan of resubdivision will be acted upon without a public hearing. Such hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-26d of the CGS as amended and shall be advertised as prescribed in Section 8-26, Chapter 126, 1985 Revision of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut as amended.
3.3 DECISIONS – APPROVAL, DISAPPROVAL, MODIFICATION
The Commission may approve, modify and approve or disapprove any formal Final Plan of subdivision. All decisions shall be rendered within the statutory time limit established in Section 8-26d of the CGS as amended.
3.4 NOTIFICATION OF DECISION
The Commission shall notify the subdivider of its decision by certified mail within 15 days after the decision has been rendered. Notice of the decision shall also be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation within the town.
3.5 APPROVAL BY DEFAULT
Failure of the Commission to approve or disapprove a final plan of subdivision or to recommend modifications within the statutory time limits established in Section 8-26d of the CGS, as amended, shall constitute approval of the plans, and a certificate of approval shall be endorsed thereon by the Commission upon demand.
3.6 FILING OF THE APPROVED FINAL PLAN
Two sets of mylars of the final plans will be provided to the Commission for signature after an approval has been issued. One set of the signed mylars will be retained in the Town Planner’s office and one set of signed mylars shall be returned to the subdivider for recording and filing after the time for taking an appeal from the action of the Commission has lapsed. Final approved plans may be filed, at the subdivider’s expense, in the office of the Town Clerk. Any plans
- 9 -
not so filed within 90 days of approval or 90 days of the date upon which such Final Plan is approved because the Commission failed to act shall be null and void. Filing time may be extended for two 90-day periods upon request of the subdivider and approval of the Commission. No Final Plan may be recorded or filed unless approval has been endorsed thereon by the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission. Without such approval the plan is null and void.

SECTION 6: DESIGN INFORMATION AND CRITERIA
6.1 STREETS in a subdivision shall conform to the following criteria:
6.1.1 STREET ARRANGEMENT
The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the coordination of the principal streets of adjoining properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic, and the construction or extension, presently or when later required, of needed utilities and public services such as sewers, water and drainage facilities. When the topographic or other conditions make such continuance impractical in the opinion of the Commission, the above requirements may be modified.
6.1.2 STREET ORIENTATION – SOLAR ACCESS
Where the topography and soil/ledge conditions will permit, streets shall be oriented so that they run in an east-west direction. In the case of new subdivisions where the topography, soil/ledge or previous street orientation prohibits the east-west orientation of new streets, the layout of the lots and buildings shall be adjusted for orientation to the sun.
6.1.3 NEW STREETS
Where the subdivision adjoins unsubdivided and potentially developable land, the Commission may require new streets to be carried to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision. If proposed new streets either do not extend, or are not adjacent to, the boundaries of the tract, they shall be separated from such boundaries by a distance of not less than two hundred feet (200’). Reservation of title in and land controlling access to streets is prohibited.
6.1.4 RESERVED RIGHTS-OF-WAY
When required by the Commission, the developer shall dedicate, to the Town, reserved rights-of-way for future street connections to adjoining properties susceptible to being subdivided. Such reserved rights-of-way shall be included in any agreement by and between the Town of East Windsor and the developer, and shall include slope rights fifteen feet (15’) outside of the street right-of-way. These right-of-ways shall have necessary radial intersection. Lots adjoining these rights-of-way shall be so laid out that access to the house or garage shall not be over the reserved right-of-way. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the developer of said adjoining property shall be required to connect to and build the street over the reserved right-of-way at his own expense.
- 16 -
6.1.5 STREET WIDTHS (EFFECTIVE 6/17/06)
Minimum widths for the various street designations shall be as shown in the following table:

Minor local street Fifty feet (50’) Twenty-six feet (26’)
Cul-de-sac serving Fifty feet (50’) Twenty-two feet (22’)
Less than 20 lots
Wider streets than those specified above may be required where the Commission deems them to be necessary.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street, which does not comply with the specified width requirements, the subdivider shall dedicate the necessary area to the Town for street widening and show such widening on the final subdivision plan.
6.1.6 BLOCK DIMENSIONS
Block dimensions shall be sufficient, in the opinion of the Commission, to allow for safe ingress and egress to the subdivision for Fire Department and public safety vehicles with regard to the topography and location of said subdivision, but the minimum block length shall be no less than two-hundred feet (200’). Special attention shall be given to blocks in industrial and business areas to provide for access to off-street parking and loading areas.
6.1.7 CUL-DE-SAC STREETS
Where cul-de-sac streets are included in a subdivision, they shall not contain more than twenty (20) homes. They shall be equipped with a turn-around which has a minimum right-of-way radius of sixty feet (60’) and a minimum pavement radius of fifty feet (50’). On permanent cul-de-sac streets, the Commission may permit a landscaped center island provided that the inside radius of the paved travel way shall be able to accommodate the turning radius of a vehicle with a 40-foot fixed wheelbase (WB-40). When a cul-de-sac is proposed as a temporary measure pending future development of adjoining property, it shall be so designed as to be feasible of continuation in the adjacent tract. (EFFECTIVE 6/17/06)
-17-
When there is a possibility of extension of street, all portions of the cul-de-sac, including pavement, grass strip and sidewalk width, shall occupy the space
by virtue of an easement delivered to the Town before acceptance of the street.
The developer extending a street from a cul-de-sac shall be required to remove the existing pavement outside of the standard traveled way, loam and seed said area in which pavement has been removed and install curbs and sidewalks in the original cul-de-sac area in accordance with Town requirements and all at his own expense.
6.1.8 HALF STREETS
The dedication of half streets at the perimeter of a new subdivision is prohibited. If circumstances render this impractical, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street must be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists a half-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed development.
6.1.9 SIDE SLOPES
Streets in cut of fill shall be provided with slopes not steeper than two feet (2’) horizontal to one foot (1’) vertical, or the permanence of the street grade shall be otherwise provided to the satisfaction of the Town. In all areas where the side slopes are steeper than four feet (4’) horizontal to one foot (1’) vertical and slope down from the street, metal beam type guardrails shall be installed in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Subdivisions.
Where new streets abut private property, necessary slope rights shall be obtained by the developer when in cut or fill, and these slope rights shall be shown on the final layout submission to the Commission. The developer shall investigate the effect of fills on adjacent property within the slope rights area. The developer shall provide the Town with evidence that no drainage problems or other problems will arise on adjacent property due to construction or fill operations.
6.1.10 RELATION TO TOPOGRAPHY
The street of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical relationship to the topography, and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of the street. Special effort should be made to orient streets east/west on south facing slopes to allow buildings to be sited for optimum solar access. All natural features shall be preserved where so required by the Commission.
-18-
6.1.11 INTERSECTIONS
No more than two (2) streets shall intersect or meet at any one (1) point and the centerline of all streets entering an intersection shall pass through a single point. Except where impracticable because of topography or other conditions, all streets shall join each other so that, for a distance of at least
One-hundred feet (100’), the street is at approximately right angles to the street it joins. Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed five percent (5%) for a distance of not less than one hundred feet (100’) from the centerline of said intersection. Intersections shall be spaced a minimum of two hundred feet (200’) apart, measured from the point of intersection of the center lines. Two (2) streets intersecting opposite sides of a third street are to have the same points of intersection or else their center lines are to be separated by a minimum of two-hundred feet (200’) on a third street. The subdivision plan shall be submitted to the State Highway Department if a proposed street in the subdivision intersects with a State Highway.
6.1.12 STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT (STATE OF CT DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION)
Review may be required by the Commission. For a distance of fifty feet (50’) from the point of two (2) intersecting lines nearest to the street intersection, all planting, screening and grading shall be so designed and maintained as to assure adequate visibility for approaching pedestrian and vehicular traffic. This sight line shall be shown on the map so as to become a permanent property requirement.
6.1.13 WATERCOURSES
Where a major watercourse separates an existing street from abutting property to be subdivided, provision shall be made for carrying such watercourse by means of culverts or other structures of design. Any such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Inland Wetlands Agency/Conservation Commission and the Town Engineer prior to Commission approval.
6.1.14 DEDICATION OF STREETS
Approval of a Final Subdivision Plan shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance of any street by the Town. However, the filing of an approved final Subdivision Plan shall constitute an irrevocable offer of dedication by the owner of the land to the Town.
6.1.15 DRIVEWAYS
All driveways shall be provided with fifteen foot (15’) paved aprons ending at the gutter or street face of the curb lines.
-19-
6.1.16 STREET SIGNS

6.1.17 VERTICAL DESIGN CRITERIA
The minimum grade of all streets shall be one percent (1%). The maximum grade on major local streets shall be five percent (5%) and on secondary local or minor local streets shall be eight percent (8%). All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves so that clear visibility shall be provided for a minimum stopping distance of three hundred feet (300’) on minor local streets and three hundred fifty (350’) on secondary local and major streets. Vertical curves shall be designed in accordance with AASHO Standards for stopping sight distance for sag and crest curves.
6.1.18 HORIZONTAL DESIGN CRITERIA
Where street lines deflect from each other within a block, the inside radius shall not be less than one hundred feet (100’). At street intersections, the property lines shall be on a curve with the radius of fifteen feet (15’).
6.1.19 EXCESSIVE COST TO THE TOWN
Where, in the opinion of the Commission, a subdivision requires undue expenditure by the Town to improve existing Town streets which do not conform to the minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width, and construction set forth in these Regulations, the Commission may not approve such subdivision until the Board of Selectmen and the Board of Finance have recommended such expenditures, and such expenditures have been approved by a Town Meeting.
6.1.20 STREET BOUND STONES
Street bound stones shall be placed at all block corners, at angle points, and the points of curves in streets and at such intermediate points as may be necessary. The location of all street monuments shall be indicated on the final subdivision plan. They shall be installed and their accuracy certified by a registered land surveyor.

SECTION 7: OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS (AMENDED, EFFECTIVE 6/17/06)
7.1 Open Space Required
The Commission shall, except as noted below, require provision be made for preservation of open space as part of every residential subdivision.
7.2 Flexibility of Approach
1. In accordance with Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, such preservation may be accomplished through the dedication of one or more parcels of open space land in the subdivision or through the provision of a fee in lieu of dedication of land or both.
2. The Commission is aware that it is not desirable in all situations to require the dedication of open space land in all subdivisions, particularly those which are small, and because there is a need to treat all subdividers equally, the Commission may, at its discretion, accept a fee in lieu of land dedication from the subdivider for all or any part of the open space, in accordance with the provisions of section 8-25 of the CGS.
7.3 Declaration and Consideration
1. At the time of filing the formal application for subdivision approval the subdivider shall indicate on the application and final plans whether 20% of the land will be reserved for open space purposes or a fee in lieu of the land for open space will be paid to the town or a combination of land reservation and fee is proposed.
2. The Commission shall consider the proposal and make the final determination after discussing with the subdivider as to whether land shall be dedicated, or fee levied or any combination thereof shall occur. The Commission’s decision shall be based on an examination and evaluation of:
a. The Town’s existing and proposed recreation elements, proposals in the town’s Plan of Development and recommendations of the Park and Recreation Commission and Inland Wetland / Conservation Commission;
b. The topography, geology, access and location of land within the proposed development, and;
c. The size and shape of the development and its relation to other proposed developments in the immediate area.
7.4 Dedication Requirements
1. Where the open space requirement will be met, in whole or in part, through the dedication of land, the total area reserved for open space shall equal or exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total land area of the subdivision.
-26-
2. Such open space shall:
? Be contiguous to other open space whenever possible.
? Be of sufficient size to make a meaningful contribution to the open space network, and
? At the option of the Commission, be dedicated to the Town, State, land trust, or other recognized conservation organization with adequate controls to assure its maintenance and preservation.
3. Land which comprises the minimum open space set-aside of twenty percent (20%) of the total parcel shall be of a similar ratio of buildable land to unbuildable land as the entire subdivision or shall, in the opinion of the Commission, preserve environmentally sensitive areas such as river corridors, wildlife sanctuaries or other natural features.
4. To satisfy all or a portion of the open space requirements of a subdivision, the Commission may consider lands located elsewhere in East Windsor.
5. When the subdivision is a portion of a larger parcel of land, the Commission may consider dedication of an area of land in the undeveloped part of the parcel but outside of the proposed area of the subdivision.
6. The Commission may determine the area to be preserved as open space on the parcel being subdivided in order to:
a. preserve important natural resources,
b. preserve scenic areas,
c. preserve agricultural lands,
d. provide for the establishment of a greenway, or
e. expand adjacent open space areas.
7. The ultimate ownership of dedicated open spaces, parks and playgrounds – be it the Town of East Windsor, a land trust, or a recognized conservation organization – should be determined by the Commission on a case-by-case basis at the time of subdivision approval after considering such factors as:
a. the function and location of the parcel,
b. its intended users/beneficiaries, and
c. the amount and cost of the future maintenance.
8. The Commission reserves the right to make the final decision on the suitability of open space land and the means of preservation.
7.5 Fee In Lieu Requirements
1. Where the open space requirement will be met, in whole or in part, through the payment of a fee, a flat fee shall be paid for each lot. The amount of the per-lot fee shall be established by the Commission each year based on a recommendation from the Assessor. Alternatively, the subdivider may instead pay a fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision based on an appraisal prepared by a licensed appraiser paid for by the subdivider. If there is any dispute about the value of the appraisal, the fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the Commission and the subdivider at the subdivider’s expense.
-27-
2. If payment of a fee is proposed, the Commission may refuse such fee if it determines, in its sole discretion, that there is one or more areas on the parcel being subdivided which should be preserved through dedication of land.
3. When a fee in lieu of land is accepted by the Commission, the subdivider may elect, at his or her option, to pay the fee to the Town Treasurer prior to filing the approved subdivision with the Town Clerk.
4. If the applicant chooses not to pay the fee prior to the recording of the subdivision then the pro-rated fee for each lot shall be paid to the Town Treasurer at the time of the first sale or transfer of each approved lot in the subdivision. The fee due the Town of East Windsor shall constitute a lien against each individual lot, and shall be so noted on the land records of the Town. The Commission, or its designated agent, shall cause such lien(s) to be discharged upon notice by the Town Treasurer that the fee for an individual lot has been paid.
5. The Town Treasurer shall place all fees collected under the provisions of this regulation in a special fund appropriately named to be used at some future date for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
7.6 Exemptions
1. The open space requirements of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first cousin for no consideration provided, however, that the waiver of the provisions for open space fees shall be noted on the land records along with a notice stating that any lot subject to the waiver shall be liable for its proportional share of the total fee at the time of subsequent sale or transfer to a person not exempt under this subsection if such sale or transfer occurs within five years of the original subdivision approval.
2. The open space requirements of this section shall not apply if:
a. a subdivision meets the requirements for an affordable housing development under Section 8-30g of the Connecticut General Statutes, or
b. the Commission elects to exempt the proposed subdivision since it will contain affordable housing, as defined herein, equal to twenty percent or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision.
-28-
SECTION 8: EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
8.1 ACTIVITIES REQUIRING A CERTIFIED EROSION AND SEDIMENT PLAN
8.1.1 A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted with any application for development when the disturbed area of such development is cumulatively more than one-half acre.
8.1.2 The determination of the area that will be disturbed shall be the responsibility of the Planning and Zoning Commission or its designated agent.
8.2 EXEMPTIONS
A single family dwelling that is not part of a subdivision of land, farming activities normally demonstrated in the growing of crops, cultivation of soil and harvesting shall be exempt from these soil erosion and sedimentation control regulations.
8.3 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLAN
8.3.1 To be eligible for certification, a soil and sediment control plan shall contain proper provisions to adequately control accelerated erosion and sedimentation and reduce the danger from storm water runoff on the proposed site, based on the best available technology. Such principles, methods and practices necessary for certification are found in the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control (1985) as amended. Alternative principles, methods and practices may be used with prior approval of the Commission.
8.3.2 Said plan shall contain, but not be limited to:
a. A narrative describing:
1) the development;
2) the schedule for grading and construction activities, including:
(a) start and completion dates;
(b) sequence of construction and grading activities;

SECTION 11: PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (EFFECTIVE 6/17/06)
11.1 Purpose and Authority
The purpose of this Regulation is to encourage variety and flexibility in single-family detached residential development, conservation of open spaces and scenic and natural resources, and imaginative site planning and architectural design.
The Planned Residential Development (PRD) is an open space/conservation subdivision regulation that is allowed for single-family detached residential development in the R-2, R-3, A-1, and A-2 residential/agricultural zones and MFDD – Multi-Family Development Districts, provided that a Special Permit is granted by the Commission for the location and development. The requirements and provisions of the existing zone shall apply, unless specifically noted as part of the PRD or specifically waived by the Commission as part of the subdivision approval in accordance with Section 8-26 of the CGS.
The Commission may waive any requirement of the Subdivision Regulations, including the provisions of Section 11, by a three-fourths vote, of those members present and voting provided the following conditions are met:
a. Conditions exist which affect the subject land adversely and are not generally applicable to other land in the area
b. The granting of a waiver will not have a significant adverse effect upon adjacent property or the public health and safety.
c. The granting of a waiver will not be in conflict with the Plan of Conservation and Development
d. Sound engineering practices shall be followed and approved by the Town Engineer.
11.2. Design Requirements for PRD
When designing a PRD site, the developer shall consider the following:
a. The natural layout of the site including natural resources and topography.
b. The character of the surrounding land and area.
c. Open space policies and open space needs of the community.
When designing a PRD site, the developer shall, when possible:
a. Provide or maintain adequate green space along existing roads.
b. Avoid or minimize driveway access to existing roads.
c. Avoid or minimize rear yards fronting on existing roads or limit the views of rear yards.
d. Preserve natural and scenic vistas.
11.3. Open Space Requirements
The following are the Commission's Open Space priorities and policies:
a. Open Space shall be meaningful and contribute to the Town's Open Space plan and policies.
? If the open space does not contribute to the Town's Open Space Plan, the
-34
developer shall demonstrate the value of the proposed open space.
? A fee in lieu of open space or combination of open space and a fee may be accepted. The applicant must demonstrate the need and value of this option. The base fee may increase in relation to the area and bulk waivers granted.
b. Open space that encourages active recreation (ball fields, playgrounds, etc.) is strongly encouraged.
c. The Commission encourages open space that includes passive recreation (walking trails) and that adds to or creates open space networks.
d. The Commission encourages open space that is adjacent to existing open space and is willing to consider off-site open space that is adjacent to existing open space, provided that satisfies open space needs.
e. Depending on the situation, open space may be dedicated to the Town, State, a land trust or other recognized conservation organization acceptable to the Commission.
? The Commission encourages dedication options that encourage public access, ensure maintenance, and maximizes public benefit and minimizes financial impacts to the Town.
? When open space is part of the Town's Open Space Plan, dedication to the Town is preferred.
? The Commission encourages open space that preserves prime agricultural land and provides the opportunity to continue agricultural use of the land.

2. Storm drainage shall be designated to flow full.
3. Storm sewers shall have a minimum pitch of one-half of one percent (0.5%). Variance from this requirement may be granted by the Commission if storm sewers are designed with a minimum self-cleaning velocity of three feet per second (3’/s) with full flowing pipes.
4. A minimum cover of two and one-half feet (2½’) shall be provided for all storm drains.
No storm drain shall outlet into a natural watercourse, whether continually flowing or intermittent, so as to exceed the capacity of the watercourse without provisions being made to satisfactorily increase the capacity of the watercourse as required.
5. All storm drain system outlets shall be terminated with an approved outlet structure.
6. The first inlet in a storm drain system shall be located within three hundred-fifty feet (350’) of the roadway highpoint. A drainage structure, either an inlet or a manhole, shall be provided at three hundred foot (300’) intervals on all storm drains with exception of the first inlet. A drainage structure shall also be placed at each grade change along a storm drain, at each change in horizontal direction, and at each junction point of two (2) or more storm drains.
7. Under drain outlets shall be connected to drainage structures whenever practical. When impractical, they shall be terminated with an approved end wall. At all under drain outlets, a “free outlet” condition should be provided.
8. The minimum pipe size for all storm drain systems constructed under these Regulations shall be fifteen inch (15”) inside diameter except that culverts in rural areas shall be thirteen (13”) diameter minimum and under drain shall be eight inch (8”) diameter minimum.
-42-
9. The following types of pipes shall be used for drainage installations:
a) Reinforced concrete pipe for surface drainage storm sewer systems and cross culverts;
b) Where clearance is limited by existing utilities, pipe arches or oval pipe will be used;
c) On grades over ten percent (10%), use ACCMP;
d) Where uneven support is expected, use ACCMP.
10. A channel or brook right-of-way or easement of sufficient minimum width to include a ten-foot (10’) access strip in addition to the width of the channel or brook from bank top to bank top, shall be offered for dedication to the Town for drainage purposes. Channels shall be rip rapped or paved when deemed necessary by the Commission.
11. Drainage easements, outside of street lines, shall be not less than twenty feet (20’) nor more than thirty feet (30’) wide and shall include wording so as to allow inclusion of other utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. Easements for outlet pipes shall extend to a suitable existing storm drain or an adequate natural watercourse. The centerline of the storm sewer is to be installed ten feet (10’) from one edge of the right-of-way.
12. Where the development streets join existing Town streets, the developer must provide drainage at intersections as necessary, or as directed by the Commission.
13. The size and location of all private storm drains that connect to the Town storm drain system shall be approved by the Commission prior to installation. A waiver must be filed by the developer with the Commission. The waiver shall relieve the Town of East Windsor of any responsibility for damage resulting from any failure of the storm drainage system. This waiver shall be part of the deed so as to run with the property as to subsequent purchasers.
14. Rear yard drains and cellar or foundation drains that are connected to storm drainage systems must be shown on the final approved plan of the drainage system.
15. Details of special or unusual drainage structures shall be submitted to the Commission for review and approval before construction.
16. Where any proposed lot, or lots, has its required frontage on an existing Town street, and has an existing ditch or waterway along the front of said lot, or lots, but within the Town right-of-way, the developer, at his expense, shall install a storm water pipe drain of suitable size and material, necessary catch basins, and a curb, to conform with the curb line.
