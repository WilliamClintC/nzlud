WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Whittier, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supplement 3-09, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Whittier, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1984, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement 3-09 Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Robert Flandrick, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement 3-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 3103 , passed June 11, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement 3-09 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement 3-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement 3-09 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement 3-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement 3-09, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2, 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use.

This coordination of initiative ordinances with the code does not alter their character as such.

The council finds and declares that it is necessary, essential, a public purpose and a municipal affair for the city to be authorized to provide financing to certain health institutions which provide essential services to residents of the city, in order to aid such health institutions in containing costs and thereby to enable such health institutions to establish lower charges or containment of the rate of increase in hospital rates. Unless the city intervenes to provide such financing or refinancing, the rates and charges may increase at an ever accelerated pace because the health institutions cannot obtain financing at equivalent cost from private sources. The council further finds and declares that it is necessary, essential, a public purpose and a municipal affair for the city to be authorized to provide financing to certain educational institutions which provide educational services primarily within the city so as to give this and future generations of youth the fullest opportunity to learn and develop their intellectual and mental capacities and to provide private institutions of higher education an additional means by which to expand, enlarge and establish dormitory, academic and related facilities, to finance such facilities and to refinance existing facilities.

To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Prior code § 6313)

"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. A person shall not be deemed a transient where the occupancy is pursuant to a written agreement providing for a stay of thirty consecutive days or longer, so long as the agreement is permitted under Title 18 of this code for the subject property. Notwithstanding the existence of a valid agreement for any period of time, a person shall be considered a transient for purposes of this chapter if for any reason the actual period of occupancy does not exceed thirty days. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Prior code § 6501) 
(Ord. No. 2917, §§ 15, 1-27-09)  
3.20.030 - Imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any lodging facility, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transients shall pay the tax to the operator of the lodging facility at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the lodging facility. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the lodging facility, the city clerk-treasurer may require that the tax shall be paid directly to the city clerk-treasurer.

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the city clerk-treasurer. The city clerk-treasurer may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.

C.  Fraud. If the city clerk-treasurer determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

3.20.090 - Determination when not collected. 
If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the city clerk-treasurer shall proceed in such manner as he deems best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city clerk-treasurer procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect it and to make the report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case the determination is made, the city clerk-treasurer shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last-known place of address. The operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the city clerk-treasurer for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the city clerk-treasurer shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If the application is made, the city clerk-treasurer shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the city clerk-treasurer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.20.100. 
(Prior code § 6508)  
3.20.100 - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the city clerk-treasurer with respect to the amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk-treasurer within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The city clerk-treasurer shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal by the city council, and the city clerk-treasurer shall give notice in writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in Section 3.20.090 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 6509)

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the city clerk-treasurer. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the city clerk-treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable to the operator by the transient. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the city clerk-treasurer, or when the transient under the provisions of this chapter is deemed a debt owed by the city clerk-treasurer that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Prior code § 6511)

Such supplemental return shall be presented to the tax administrator within ninety days of the initial return, in accordance with Sections 1113 and 1115 of the Charter.

Chapter 3.48 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES 
Sections: 
 
3.48.010 - General findings. 
The City Council of the City of Whittier, California, finds as follows: 
A.  The provision of new and expanded facilities and infrastructure is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of all the citizens of the city of Whittier by reducing the adverse effects of urbanization and development. 
B.  It is necessary to enact and implement certain development impact fees to assure that all new development within the city pays its fair share of the costs of providing necessary public facilities and infrastructure to accommodate such new development. 
C.  A proper funding source for the costs associated with new development is a specific development or facilities fee for each type of facility related to the specific need created by the development and reasonably related to the relative cost of providing such necessary public facilities. 
D.  The City of Whittier Library Facilities and Collection and Park-Related Facilities Master Facilities Plan and Development Impact Fee Calculation and Nexus Report ("development impact fee report") justifies the imposition of each development fee on new construction by analyzing the master facility plan as defined herein, assigning the costs on a fair-share basis to the various types of new development, and assigning the resulting fee per dwelling unit, based on the anticipated burden of such new dwelling unit on city facilities and infrastructure and the need created by such dwelling unit for new and expanded facilities and infrastructure.

3.48.040 - Library, computer stations and collection itemsFindings. 
The city council finds as follows: 
A.  The library facilities, computer stations and library collections are important quality of life amenities that are necessary to serve the residents of the city. As the city increases in population, the library facilities, computer stations and library collections will become inadequate and/or overcrowded for their intended use, thus requiring construction, addition of computer stations and/or purchase of additional books and other collection items. 
B.  Pursuant to Article 11, Section 7 of the California Constitution, the city is empowered to enact measures that protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. 
C.  Provisions for library facilities, computer stations and library collections are identified in the master facilities plan, as amended, found in the development impact fee report, as amended and are necessary to provide adequate library facilities, computer stations and library collections within the affected territory.

E.  The entire affected territory will derive benefit from the expansion of the library facilities, computer stations and collections and should be assessed per the provisions of this chapter and pay a fair share of the cost thereof based on the benefit derived therefrom. 
F.  After consideration of the development impact fee report, as amended and the addendum thereto and testimony at public hearings duly held, the city council hereby approves the development impact fee report, as amended and based thereon finds that new residential development in the affected territory will create library facilities, computer stations and library collection impacts which the construction and/or purchase of additional library facilities, computer stations and library collections funded by this chapter will offset. 
G.  The city council also finds that the costs of the library facilities, computer stations and library collections funded by this chapter are apportioned relative to the anticipated impacts created by residential and other new development within the affected territory, and that the fees are fairly apportioned on individual dwelling units throughout the affected territory on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for residential development and the need for such facilities created by the proposed new development. 
H.  The facts and evidence establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the described library facilities, computer stations and library collections and the needs created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed, and that there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the types of development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is described in more detail in the development fee impact report, as amended. 
I.  The city council also finds that the cost estimates set forth in the development impact fee report, as amended are reasonable and will not exceed the reasonably estimated total of these costs. 
J.  The library and collection items fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used only to finance library, books, computer stations and other collections expansion described or identified in the city of Whittier library facilities and collection section of the master facilities plan, as amended. 
K.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, the herein findings, the amount of fees to be imposed and the purposes for which the fees may be used to finance; may be updated and revised by the city council with an amendment to the development impact fee report. Such amendment must be adopted by resolution at a properly noticed public hearing in compliance with state law.

Such deferral, waiver or reduction may only be granted after notice and hearing if, in the opinion of the city council, properly supported by specific findings, deferral would allow a better or fairer financing arrangement to be developed and imposed, or where waiver or reduction is required because imposition of such fee or fees in full would cause inequities. Findings must be based on written and other evidence submitted by the property owner substantiating the owners contention that the fee should be deferred, waived or reduced. For deferrals, findings must include facts supporting such deferral including, without limitation, findings that (1) other properties to be benefited by any fee will not be burdened by the review and delay in fee imposition, or, (2) alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have been proposed for review, or (3) delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement. In the case of waiver or reduction, findings must include facts supporting, including, without limitation, that the owner will receive insufficient or no benefit from the fee imposed and would therefore be required, if the fee were imposed in full, to pay more than his fair share for the benefit received.

The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues during the appeal and/or in court. 
If a hearing is held on the appeal, then during such hearing, the appellant will be limited to issues and/or evidence previously raised in the appeal itself. The appellant shall not be permitted to present any other issues and/or oral, written and/or documentary evidence during the appeal process. 
In considering the appeal, the city manager shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the requirements of this chapter, and may grant or deny a permit or require such changes in the proposed use or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to said criteria.

Petitions must be on the appeal form provided by the community development department and submitted to the community development department at 13230 Penn Street, 2nd Floor, Whittier, CA 90602.

If a hearing is held on the petition, then during such hearing, the petitioner will be limited to issues and/or evidence previously raised in the petition itself. The petitioner shall not be permitted to present any other issues and/or oral, written and/or documentary evidence during the petition process.

That the existence of any real property in a condition constituting a nuisance, as defined in this chapter, is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the problems of, and the necessity for, excessive and disproportionate expenditures for protection against hazards and diminution of property values, prevention of crime, and the preservation of the public health and safety and the maintaining of adequate police, fire and accident protection; that the problems are becoming increasingly direct and substantial in significance and effect; and 
D.  That the existence of public nuisances of the type referred to in this chapter, and the abatement thereof, is reasonably related to the proper exercise of the police power in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public, and the exercise of such power by this city is authorized by the Constitution of the state, its Charter, Section 65800 et seq., Section 38660 et seq., Section 38771 et seq., and Section 39500 et seq. of the Government Code of the state, and other applicable law; and 
E.  That unless corrective measures of the type set forth in this chapter are undertaken to alleviate such existing conditions, the public health, safety and general welfare, and the property values and social and economic standards of this community will be substantially depreciated; that the abatement of the conditions will enhance the environment of the residents of the city; and 
F.  That the abatement procedures set forth in this chapter are reasonable and afford a maximum of due process and procedural guarantees to affected property owners.

a)  The property owner shall landscape the entire lot using drought tolerate or xeriscape material that requires little to no water after the first three years of growth. Durable, high quality, synthetic turf may also be used as an alternative.

The ground cover shall be maintained in good condition at all times. 
b)  The lot shall be improved with an operable automatic irrigation system for the ground cover which shall be installed and maintained in good condition by the property owner at all times.

Any on-site litter, weeds, debris or stockpiling of material shall be immediately removed by the property owner, upon discovery. The property owner or their designated representative shall be responsible for inspecting the property at reasonable intervals or take other steps to reasonably ensure that no litter, weeds, graffiti, debris or material stockpiling collects or is maintained on the lot. 
d)  Any dead or dying vegetation as well as any broken, malfunctioning or non-functioning irrigation components on the lot shall be replaced by the property owner within seventy-two hours of their discovery or notification.

In circumstances where the director of parks, recreation and community services finds that a higher perimeter barrier is warranted for adequate security of the site and/or because of unusual topographical circumstances associated with the vacant lot, the perimeter barrier may be constructed up to a maximum of eight feet high. All perimeter barriers shall include a gravel pathway leading to a security gate to provide accessibility to the interior of the lot for the police department or other emergency personnel. A key or security code for the gate shall be provided to the Whittier Police Department by the property owner upon installation and shall be kept up-to-date at all times. 
e)  All decorative, view obscuring, perimeter barriers shall consist of either painted wood, redwood, woodcrete, green vinyl chain-link fencing with a green windscreen securely attached (along the interior of the fence), or any other durable, aesthetically attractive, material deemed acceptable to the director of parks, recreation and community services.

Any on-site litter, debris or stockpiling of material shall be immediately removed by the property owner, upon discovery or notification. The property owner or their designated representative shall be responsible for inspecting the property at reasonable intervals, or take other steps to reasonably ensure that no litter, weeds, graffiti, debris or material stockpiling collects or is maintained on the lot. 
4.  All on-site structures shall be maintained in good condition at all times. Damage to any on-site buildings or structures shall be abated within ten days by the property owner upon discovery.

C.  Vacant Lot Landscape and Irrigation Plan. Prior to the issuance of a demolition permit on any lot in which the construction of a new building, structure, parking lot, or impervious surface will not commence within thirty days after demolition, the property owner shall submit a vacant lot landscape and irrigation plan for review and approval of the director of parks, recreation and community services (with the appropriate plan check fees). The director of parks, recreation and community services may impose any reasonable conditions of approval on the vacant lot landscape and irrigation plan to ensure that the lot will be adequately maintained during the time that it is vacant. Upon approval of the plan, the landscape and irrigation improvements to the lot, as specified in the plan, shall be completed to the satisfaction of the director of parks, recreation and community services within thirty days after demolition. A reasonable extension of time may be granted by the director of parks, recreation and community services in those situations when the director, in his or her sole discretion, determines that a good faith effort is being made by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this section. 
1.  Appeal of Decision. 
a)  The decision of the director of parks, recreation and community services to approve, conditionally approve or deny any vacant lot landscape and irrigation plan may be appealed in writing to the city manager within fifteen calendar days.

D.  View Obscuring Barriers and Fencing on Vacant Lots. There shall be no on-site fencing or view obscuring perimeter barriers that screen any vacant lot in any manner that obstructs vehicular and/or pedestrian visibility of the public right-of-way, or interferes with the public's use of the public right-of-way, as determined by the director of public works. The directors of public works and parks, recreation and community services shall approve the location and design of all vacant lot fencing and perimeter barriers prior to the construction of any such fencing or barriers on a vacant lot. 
E.  The director of parks, recreation and community services shall implement all applicable sections of Chapter 13.42 (Water Conservation in Landscaping), regardless of the size of the vacant lot, to ensure that the approved vacant lot landscape and irrigation plan conserves water to greatest extent possible, while preserving the health of the landscaping approved on the vacant lot. 
F.  Where a recorded easement on vacant lot exists, the director of parks, recreation and community services may require and/or permit the property owner to use an appropriate ground cover over the easement (i.e., gravel, turf block, paving or some other acceptable material) that would enable a vehicle to drive over the easement.

Chapter 8.22 - GRAFFITI ABATEMENT FEES AND PROCEDURE 
 
8.22.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The city council of the city finds and declares that: 
A.  The enlistment of business owners' active resistance to graffiti could be emphasized as a key element in combating graffiti crime. 
B.  In the past, the city has provided unlimited, free graffiti removal services. While this is a tremendous service to city businesses, and benefits the overall community in terms of eradicating graffiti, it provides no incentive to businesses to deal directly with the problem and formulate their own ideas, solutions and defense strategies as to how to avoid being victimized. 
C.  With the current economic crises, and the resulting reduction in number of staff directly assigned to graffiti abatement, it is essential that the city develop new approaches to reinforcing the program and maintaining and increasing its effectiveness. 
D.  Given the reduction in resources, the perpetual providing of free and unlimited graffiti abatement service, as the city's only approach to graffiti crime, is no longer an effective approach in and of itself. Other supportive policies must be developed and implemented. 
E.  The purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to provide an alternative method for graffiti abatement through the establishment of graffiti abatement fees to be applied to businesses within the city. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.020 - Declared a public nuisance. 
Any graffiti placed and/or existing upon publicly or privately owned permanent structures located on publicly or privately owned real property within the city is declared to be indecent and offensive to the sense, thereby constituting a public nuisance. Such graffiti if not so removed as provided in this chapter, shall be abated as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.030 - Removal policy. 
A.  The city shall provide graffiti abatement services to a business within the city. The graffiti shall be removed free of charge provided that requests for the same do not exceed four per property with the same owner. 
B.  Where a business requires graffiti removal more than four times, the owner of such property may abate said nuisance by independent means or request removal by the city. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.040 - Fee required. 
A.  Where an owner of commercial property requests graffiti removal pursuant to Section 8.22.030(B) of this chapter, the owner shall be required to pay a fee for such services. 
B.  Fees established by this section shall also apply where city abatement is mandated pursuant to Section 8.22.090 of this chapter. 
C.  Fees established herein shall be set periodically by resolution of the city council. Such fees shall include but are not limited to labor, procedural and overhead costs. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.050 - Payment of fees. 
A.  Fees established pursuant to Section 8.22.040 of this chapter and set by resolution of the city council shall be made in a timely fashion. Where an owner of commercial property has requested graffiti abatement services and fails to make payment for the same, fees shall be assessed against the property as set forth in Section 8.22.100 of this chapter. 
B.  Where graffiti abatement has been mandated pursuant to Section 8.22.090 of this chapter, the owner of the affected property may render payment of fees established by Section 8.22.040, in order to avoid subsequent assessment against said property. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.055 - Waiver of fees. 
The director of public works shall waive fees at his/her discretion, if he/she determines that the owner of the property/business is taking and continuing to take actions that prevent graffiti on his/her property. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.060 - Notice to remove. 
Whenever a graffiti incident is reported to the city and the affected business has already received the graffiti abatement services as provided by Section 8.22.030, and the owner does not abate said nuisance by independent means or request removal by the city, notice to remove such graffiti shall be given pursuant to Section 8.22.070 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2593 § 1 (part), 1993)  
8.22.070 - Form and manner of notice. 
Notice shall be given by posting in a conspicuous place upon or in front of the affected property.

8.36.040 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of the provisions of this chapter concerning water quality hereinafter set forth, the following words and phrases shall be construed to have the meanings set forth, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended: 
"Best management practices" or "BMPs" are practices or physical devices or systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or nonstormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the volume of stormwater or nonstormwater discharged to the receiving water. 
"Clean Water Act" means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1251, et seq. 
"Discharge" means any release, spill, leak, pumping, flow, escape, dumping, or disposal of any gas, liquid, semisolid or solid substance. 
"Enforcing attorney" shall mean the city attorney or district attorney acting as counsel to the city and authorized to take enforcement action as described herein. 
"Executive officer" means executive officer of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles. 
"Good housekeeping practice" means a best management practice related to the transfer, storage, use, or cleanup of materials performed in a regular manner that minimizes the discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system and/or receiving waters. 
"Hearing officer" means the director of public works of the city of Whittier, who shall preside at the administrative hearings authorized by this chapter. 
"Illicit connection" means any man-made conveyance that is connected to the storm drain system without a permit, excluding roof drains and other similar type connections. Examples include channels, pipelines, conduits, inlets, or outlets that are connected directly to the storm drain system. 
"Illicit discharge" Any discharge into the MS4 or from the MS4 into a receiving water that is prohibited under local, state, or federal statutes, ordinances, codes, or regulations. The term illicit discharge includes any nonstormwater discharge, except authorized nonstormwater discharges; conditionally exempt nonstormwater discharges; and nonstormwater discharges resulting from natural flows specifically identified in Part III.A.1.d. 
"Industrial activity" means any of the eleven classifications of industrial facilities specified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Section 122.26(b)(14), defined by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and which is required to obtain a NPDES permit. 
"Maximum extent practicable (MEP)." In selecting BMPs which will achieve MEP, it is important to remember that municipalities will be responsible to reduce the discharge of pollutants in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable. This means choosing effective BMPs, and rejecting applicable BMPs only where other effective BMPs will serve the same purpose, the BMPs would not be technically feasible, or the cost would be prohibitive. The following factors may be useful to consider: 
1.  Effectiveness: Will the BMP address a pollutant of concern? 
2.  Regulatory Compliance: Is the BMP in compliance with stormwater regulations as well as other environmental regulations? 
3.  Public acceptance: Does the BMP have public support? 
4.  Cost: Will the cost of implementing the BMP have a reasonable relationship to the pollution control benefits to be achieved? 
5.  Technical Feasibility: Is the BMP technically feasible considering soils, geography, water resources, etc.? 
After selecting a menu of BMPs, it is of course the responsibility of the discharger to insure that all BMPs are implemented.

Chapter 9.40 - NIGHTTIME CURFEW FOR MINORS 
 
9.40.010 - Purpose. 
The provisions of this chapter are adopted in accordance with the authority granted to the city under the police power delegated to it by the Constitution of the state of California. The police power provides the city with the authority to react when the potential exists for jeopardy to the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. The city is concerned with the level of juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity and juvenile crime in the city. The crimes being committed by juveniles include serious offenses such as murders, drive-by shootings, drug-related crimes and other gang-related activities. Moreover, juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gang-related activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. In addition, recent local statistics regarding juvenile crime and victimization indicate that enforcement of a curfew for juveniles decreases the percentage of juvenile victimization and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes during curfew hours. Based on the foregoing, the city believes that having an enforceable nighttime juvenile curfew ordinance is critical to preserving the public health, safety and welfare.

Chapter 9.52 - RELOCATION BENEFITS 
 
9.52.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The city council of the city of Whittier finds and declares that: 
A.  Some rental units in Whittier are found to have severe code violations which threaten the life and safety of occupants and require the units or rooms to be vacated to allow for extensive repairs. 
B.  Such code violations are often caused by deferred maintenance, may breach the landlord's implied warranty of habitability and sometimes constitute constructive eviction of the household from its residence. 
C.  Tenants of substandard residential units or structures suffer financial and other hardship when required to vacate their housing because the owner fails to correct the substandard conditions. 
D.  It is appropriate to require the owner to mitigate partially the tenant's hardship, since the hardship arises from the owner's failure to comply with the law and fulfill a landlord's obligations to the landlord's tenants. 
E.  Financial hardship arises because the tenant generally needs a large sum of money to relocate, often including first and last month's rent, deposit, moving expenses and utility deposits for a new residence. Low-income tenants are generally unable to obtain such sums and, as a result, are at great risk of becoming homeless. 
F.  The level of payments provided in this chapter are reflective of actual relocation costs likely to be incurred by displaced households. 
G.  Delayed payment of relocation benefits may impose extreme hardship upon tenants who then must themselves obtain the large sums necessary to relocate. Delayed payment may also require the city to expend city general funds to provide tenants with financial assistance for relocation. Any requirement to pay relocation benefits should contain disincentives for delayed payment in the form of appropriate penalties. 
(Ord. 2561 § 1(part), 1992)  
9.52.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply: 
A.  "Displaced." A tenant is displaced, within the meaning of this chapter, if the tenant is ordered to move out of a residential unit or structure by an order to vacate. 
B.  "Order to vacate" means the first written notice sent by an authorized city official to the owner and posted on the affected property declaring that, due to failure to repair or maintain, the unit or structure shall be vacated. 
C.  "Owner" means the owner of the property at the time the order to vacate is issued, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and any successor in interest. 
D.  "Residential unit or structure" means any dwelling apartment, room or place which is the place of permanent or customary and usual abode of any person or household. 
E.  "Tenant" means any resident of the affected property is a tenant as that term is used in Chapter 2 of Title 5 of Part 4 of the California Civil Code (Sections 1940, et seq.). 
F.  "Vacation date" means the date by which a tenant is required to vacate a unit or structure, pursuant to an order by an authorized city official. 
(Ord. 2561 § 1(part), 1992)  
9.52.030 - Relocation benefits payable to displaced tenants by owner. 
Any tenant who is displaced from any structure which is occupied as a dwelling unit, but which is illegally created, constructed or occupied for which an order issued by an authorized city official under Chapter 8.08, or any other applicable provision, that the structure is to be vacated due to unsafe or hazardous living conditions shall be entitled to receive relocation benefits from the owner as specified in this chapter.

B.  If there are fewer than ten days between the first posting or mailing of the order to vacate and the vacation date, the relocation benefits shall be payable within twenty-four hours after the order is posted or mailed. The city manager or his designee shall attempt to provide telephonic or written notice to the owner to notify the owner that benefits are payable immediately. Failure to provide the notice as specified herein shall not relieve the owner of any obligations imposed by this chapter. 
(Ord. 2561 § 1(part), 1992)  
9.52.050 - Relocation benefitsAmount payable. 
The relocation benefits shall be a sum equal to the greater of the following: (1) twice the established monthly rental rate for the unit being vacated by the displaced tenant, or (2) twice the established monthly rental rate for a two-bedroom rental unit within the city. The relocation benefits shall be paid in addition to the return, as required by law, of any deposit held by the owner plus the itemized costs as outlined in Section 9.52.070(A)(16). 
(Ord. 2561 § 1(part), 1992)  
9.52.060 - When relocation benefits are not payable. 
A.  No relocation benefits shall be payable by the owner to any tenant who caused or substantially contributed to the condition giving rise to the order to vacate as determined by the city manager or his designee. 
B.  No relocation benefits shall be payable by the owner if the unit or structure became unsafe or hazardous during the tenancy (and no more than six months prior to the order to vacate) as a result of earthquake, flood, fire, act of public enemy or other disaster not proximately caused by building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical or fire code violations. 
(Ord. 2561 § 1(part), 1992)  
9.52.070 - Payment of relocation costs by city.

1.  Transportation of the tenant's personal property to the new location; 
2.  Packing, crating, unpacking and uncrating the tenant's personal property; 
3.  Insurance of the tenant's property while in transit; 
4.  The reasonable replacement value of property lost, stolen or damaged (not through the fault or negligence of the displaced person, his or her agent or employee) in the process of moving, where insurance covering such loss, theft or damage is not reasonably available; 
5.  The costs of disconnecting, dismantling, removing, reassembling, reconnecting and reinstalling machinery, equipment or other personal property of the tenant, including connection charges imposed by utility companies for starting utility service; 
6.  Any other sums needed by the tenant to obtain substitute housing, such as deposits and prepaid rent. 
B.  Any displaced tenant who needs relocation benefits because an owner fails to pay benefits due hereunder shall apply to the city manager or his designee for benefits no later than fifteen days after vacating the premises. The city manager or his designee, shall grant benefits only if he or she determines that the tenant is eligible for benefits from the owner and shall take into consideration the amount needed by the tenant to secure alternative housing. Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the city manager or his designee, to grant or not grant benefits, or as to the amount granted, may appeal the decision to the public nuisance hearing officer. A written notice of appeal containing a brief statement of the ground for appeal shall be sent to the city manager or his designee within ten days from the date of the manager's decision. The public nuisance hearing officer shall hold an informal hearing on the appeal within fifteen days after the notice of appeal is received by the city manager or his designee, and shall issue written findings within five days after the hearing. Such findings shall be the final decision. 
C.  The city may recover from the owner any amount paid by the city to a tenant pursuant to this section. The city shall also be entitled to recover from the owner an additional amount equal to one-half the amount so paid as a penalty for failure to make timely payment to the displaced tenant and city's actual costs (including direct and indirect costs) of administering the provision of benefits to the displaced tenant.

Any amounts paid by the city including but not limited to penalties and administrative costs may after final confirmation by city manager or his designee or the city council, constitute a special assessment against the property to which it relates, and after the recording of the order of confirmation in the official records of the county recorder's office as thus made and confirmed, it shall constitute a lien on the property in the amount of the assessment. 
E.  Prior to instituting any action to collect from the owner relocation benefits paid pursuant to this section, or to impose a lien therefor, the city shall send to the owner by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the owner's address as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, an itemized accounting of all benefits paid by the city to the owner's tenants. The invoice shall notify the owner that an informal meeting to present any evidence or argument challenging the invoiced amount or liability for any amount shall be available if such written request is received by the city manager or his designee within five calendar days of the notice. The request shall be in writing, shall be signed by the owner, and shall set forth the facts and reasons upon which the contention is based. If after this informal meeting the owner maintains that not all of the benefits are chargeable to the owner, because the recipients were not displaced tenants, no benefits were payable pursuant to Section 9.52.030, or on other grounds, the owner shall submit a written appeal to the public nuisance hearing officer within twenty days after mailing to him the itemized accounting. The public nuisance hearing officer or his designee, shall hold an informal hearing for the purpose of determining the amount of benefits paid which are chargeable to the owner. If the public nuisance hearing officer upholds the decision of the city manager or his designee a fifty percent penalty shall be added for lack of timely payment to the tenant(s) as specified in Section 9.52.040 in addition to all of the city's administrative costs. The decision of the public nuisance hearing officer shall be final. Failure to receive the itemized accounting shall not relieve the owner of any obligation to the city. 
F.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall require the city to pay any relocation benefits to any tenant. 
G.  Any damages which a displaced tenant may receive under the provisions of this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any benefits received from the city.

Chapter 9.61 - SHOPPING CARTS 
Sections: 
 
9.61.010 - PurposeDeclaration of nuisance. 
Many retail establishments provide shopping carts for the convenience of customers while shopping on the premises of such businesses. However, shopping carts removed from the premises of such businesses and left abandoned on public or private property throughout the city constitute a public nuisance and a potential hazard to the health and safety of the public.

For the aforesaid reasons, such lost, stolen or abandoned shopping carts are hereby declared to be a public nuisance, which shall be subject to abatement in the manner set forth in this chapter or in any other manner provided by law.

Chapter 12.16 - STREET DEDICATION AND IMPROVEMENT 
 
12.16.010 - Findings. 
Failure to have curbs, gutters and sidewalks on state highways, arterial streets and collector streets in the city gives poor drainage, puddles of water, difficult street cleaning, the accumulation of filth and causes hazards to vehicular traffic. Without such improvements pedestrians and particularly children are forced to walk in a public thoroughfare which is normally heavily traveled with motor vehicle traffic and is the cause of accidents and injury not only to vehicular traffic, but to pedestrians using the street. Failure to have such curbs, gutters, sidewalks and improved streets is found and declared by the city council to be against the best interests of and injurious to the public health, peace and safety of the inhabitants of the city. 
(Prior code § 7111)  
12.16.020 - Dedication and improvement required. 
A.  No building or structure shall be erected or enlarged, no existing building or portion thereof shall be converted from a residential use to a commercial or manufacturing use, and no building permit shall be issued therefor on any lot or parcel of land in any zone except for a one-family dwelling unit on a lot or parcel in an R-E or R-1 zone, as defined and set forth in Title 18 of this code, if the lot or parcel of land abuts a state highway, arterial street or collector street, as shown on the map of the select street system for Whittier, unless one-half of the highway or street which is located on the same side of the center of the highway or street as the lot has been dedicated and improved for the full width of the lot or parcel of land so as to meet the standard for the highway or street provided in Section 12.16.080, or the dedication and improvement has been assured and guaranteed to the satisfaction of the city engineer. As used in this section, "the center of the highway or street" means the centers of those highways and streets as shown on the street and highway maps now on file in the city engineer's office of the city. 
B.  The maximum area of land required to be so dedicated shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the area of any such lot or parcel of land which was of record on April 1, 1966, in the county recorder's office. In no event shall the dedications reduce the lot below sixty percent of the required width and required area of the zone in which the lot is located. 
C.  No such dedication shall be required with respect to those portions of such a lot occupied by a main building which was existing on April 1, 1966. 
D.  No additional improvements shall be required on or in front of such a lot where complete roadway, curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements exist within the present dedication contiguous thereto. 
(Prior code § 7112)  
12.16.030 - Exceptions. 
The provisions of the foregoing sections of this chapter shall not apply to the following construction: 
A.  One single-family dwelling with customary accessory buildings when erected on a vacant lot; 
B.  Additions and accessory buildings incidental to a residential building legally existing on the lot provided no additional dwelling units or guest rooms are created; 
C.  Additions and accessory buildings incidental to other than a residential building existing on the lot on April 1, 1966; provided, that the total cumulative floor area of all such additions and accessory buildings shall not exceed two hundred square feet. 
(Prior code § 7113)  
12.16.040 - Required for building permit issuance. 
A.  When all dedication and improvements required by this chapter have been completed, or satisfactorily assured, as certified by the city engineer, a building permit may be issued. Otherwise, no such permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure on the lot. 
B.  No fee shall be charged for the rendering of any service by the city in connection with any dedication or improvement required by the provisions of this chapter and the improvement is not a part of a subdivision proceeding. 
(Prior code § 7117)  
12.16.050 - Notice of applicability. 
Whenever the city engineer determines that the provisions of this chapter are applicable to any building permit application, he shall notify the building permit applicant of his determination of the specific requirements of this chapter which he determines to be applicable thereto and of the procedure for appeal of his determination to the city council. 
(Prior code § 7123)

Any person required to make improvements by the provisions of this chapter shall either make and complete them to the satisfaction of the city engineer or shall file with the city engineer a surety bond in such amount as the city engineer estimates and determines to be necessary to complete all of the improvements required. 
B.  The bond shall be executed by a company authorized to act as surety in California. It shall be payable to the city and shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of any and all work required to be done and should the work not be done or completed within the time specified, then the city may do the improvement or cause it to be done or completed and the parties executing the bond shall be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary costs and expenses incurred in the construction of the improvements. The bond shall be executed by the owner of the lot as principal and by the corporation authorized to act as surety. 
C.  The owner may, in lieu of a surety bond, deposit a cash bond in an amount to be fixed by the city engineer, and the owner shall agree that in the event of any default on his part the city may use any or all of the deposit money to cause all of the required work to be done or completed and to pay for all such costs and expenses. If there is not sufficient money on deposit, then the owner shall pay any deficiency upon demand. Any money remaining on deposit after the completion of the work shall be refunded to the owner. 
D.  Whenever a surety bond has been filed in compliance with the provisions of this section, the city is authorized in the event of any default on the part of the principal to enforce collection under the bond for any and all damages sustained by the city by reason of the failure of the principal to faithfully and properly complete the required improvements. 
E.  The term of the bond shall begin on the date of the deposit of the cash or the filing of the surety bond and shall end upon the date of the completion of the work of improvement to the satisfaction of the city engineer.

2.  Except as provided in Section 12.20.30, no major encroachment shall be allowed except in compliance with the terms of a permit to be granted to the property owner of abutting real property or his authorized agent by resolution of the city council. This resolution shall be granted in the sole discretion of the city council.

4.  The city engineer shall have authority to decide the classification of an encroachment and his decision shall be final. 
5.  The city engineer may require that a separate permit be obtained for each separate project for the installation of an encroachment. 
H.  A fee for encroachment permits may be established by resolution of the city council and shall be paid to the city at the time of application for issuance or renewal of any encroachment permit, including but not limited to permit riders. Public utility companies operating under franchise agreement with the city may pay monthly or periodic permit fees, or provide a deposit in advance for the estimated volume of permit applications subject to an agreement approved by the city engineer. 
I.  If in the course of events the owner of a previously approved encroachment finds that emergency repairs are necessary to protect the facility, or to protect the investment of the owner and/or to provide continuing service to the public, and the owner of the facility finds that the city office that would issue the encroachment permit is not open, the owner may, notify the police department the nature of any encroachment into the public roadway that may affect vehicle traffic or pedestrians, after notifying the Regional Notification Center (Underground Service Alert), conduct such work as is necessary to cause the needed repairs, provided that the owner of the facility requests a permit for the work conducted on the next day that the city office that issues encroachment permits is open. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this chapter, no emergency work may be done if the police department determines that the proposed work would represent an unreasonable threat to the public health, welfare or safety or the city engineer determines that the work does not constitute an emergency.

1.  A separate application must be filed by the property owner or his authorized agent for each permit for a major encroachment. Application for a permit to install a major encroachment shall be filed in the office of the city engineer. After filing of the application, the city engineer shall cause an investigation to be made of the site where the proposed encroachment would be installed. The application must be accompanied by a sketch or plan showing the dimensions and exact location of the proposed encroachment and its relationship to the remainder of the structure and the street lines. A plan shall be required in all cases in addition to a brief written description of the encroachment. Certain major encroachments will require a legal description and plan to accompany the legal description. 
2.  When such application for a major encroachment permit and the details shown upon the accompanying sketch or plan comply with the terms of this chapter and any further requirements set by the city engineer, the applicant shall post a notice of intent to encroach adjacent to the encroachment site. Any and all responses to this notice will be forwarded to the city engineer for evaluation in recommendation of permit approval, conditional approval, or denial. All responses, recommendations and findings will be forwarded to the city council. 
3.  The city council, by license agreement, if it determines to authorize a major encroachment permit, may prescribe special conditions for granting a conditional revocable permit in compliance with the terms of this chapter and such other conditions as it deems necessary for the preservation or maintenance of the public health, safety and welfare to the extent that it will not substantially impair franchise rights previously granted to a public utility. Such license agreement constitutes a conditional revocable permit for encroachment which shall take effect when all other conditions set forth therein and of this chapter shall have been complied with and such permit shall remain in effect as long as the permittee complies with all conditions established for the granting of such permit. 
B.  The permit procedure for a minor encroachment is as follows: 
1.  A separate permit application must be filed for each minor encroachment in the office of the city engineer. Such application shall be accompanied by a sketch or plan showing the dimensions and exact location of the proposed encroachment and its relationship to any structure, and the sidewalk area. A plan shall be required in all cases in addition to a brief written description of the encroachment. After filing of the application, the City Engineer shall cause an inspection to be made of the site where the proposed encroachment would be installed. 
2.  When such application for a minor encroachment permit and the details shown upon the accompanying sketch or plan comply with the terms of this chapter and any further requirements set by the city engineer for public health, safety and appearance reasons, the applicant shall post a notice of intent to encroach adjacent to the encroachment site. The city engineer shall consider any and all responses to the notice in making his decision to deny, conditionally approve, or approve the encroachment. Such approval constitutes the granting of a conditional revocable permit for a minor encroachment and such permit shall remain in effect as long as the permittee complies with all conditions established for the granting of such permit. 
3.  Any person aggrieved by the refusal of a minor encroachment permit required by this chapter may appeal to the city council. All appeals must be filed with the city clerk within thirty days of the mailing of the decision of the city engineer for scheduling on the city council's calendar.

The city engineer shall set the amount of the deposit based on potential damage or cost of improvements not completed to and within the public property or rights-of-way. All deposits shall remain in force for a period of up to one year from the date of completion of work authorized by the permit. Utility companies doing work under any and all franchise agreements are exempt from making a security deposit. 
2.  Upon satisfactory completion of all the terms and conditions of a permit, the city engineer shall issue a certificate to this effect to the city controller. Upon receipt of such certificate and after the expiration of the time period established by the permit, the city controller shall be authorized and directed to return the cash deposit or bond or other security posted by the permittee to the permittee in accordance with the provisions in this chapter. Unless required by prior agreement or law, the amount returned will not include interest.

12.42.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The public streets and areas within the city should be readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes and/or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the public streets and public areas in blight-free conditions, to secure access to public areas and to businesses, and to ensure that public property is used for its intended purposes and remains accessible to all citizens, businesses and visitors in the City of Whittier. 
B.  Large amounts of personal property are being left unattended in public areas throughout the city, and such personal property creates blight, obstructs the public rights-of-way, interferes with access to the public areas and to businesses, and thus negatively affects quality of life in the city, and negatively affects the profitable operation of such businesses.

If the explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the consumer must pay the bill under protest in order to avoid discontinuance of service. Protests will be addressed by the director of public works, must be in writing and must state the reasons why the charges are believed to be incorrect. The director of public works will analyze the facts of the case and is authorized to make such adjustments in the charges as may be necessary to effect an equitable settlement. Failure of a consumer to pay under protest after initial explanation is offered will warrant discontinuance of service without further notice if bill is not paid by delinquency date.

A.  Purpose. In order to protect the public water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system, or the consumer's private water system, such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water system, the following provisions have been established. 
These provisions promote the control or the elimination of existing cross-connections, either actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant potable water system and nonpotable water supplies/system, plumbing fixtures and industrial water piping systems, and provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
B.  Protection of Public Water. No water service connection shall be made, installed, maintained or authorized to any premises of a type specified in Table 1, Section 7604 of Title 17 of the California Administrative Code, entitled "Type of Backflow Protection Required," unless the public water supply is protected as required by said state regulations. 
C.  Cross-connection Control Program and Enforcement. The director of public works or his authorized designee, who shall be trained in cross-connection control, shall have the authority and responsibility to implement the cross-connection control program and enforce the provision of this section. The water division is also authorized to conduct surveys or have surveys conducted on water user premises to identify where cross-connection hazards exist or may occur. 
D.  Maintenance and Testing of Backflow Prevention Devices. 
1.  Each consumer with a backflow prevention device shall test and service such device or devices at least once per year. The director of public works or his designee may require more frequent testing if it is determined to be necessary. Such consumer shall maintain such device or devices in a satisfactory operating condition at all times and shall immediately repair or replace such device or devices if found to be defective. 
2.  Tests of backflow prevention devices shall be conducted by a certified backflow prevention device tester approved by the director of public works or his designee and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
E.  Discontinuance of Water Service. Water service provided by the water division to any premises shall be discontinued after notice that a backflow prevention device has not been installed, tested, maintained as required or if any defect is found in an installed backflow prevention device, or it is found that a backflow prevention device has been altered, removed or bypassed, or if unprotected cross-connections exist on the premises. Water service shall not be restored to such premises until such conditions are corrected. 
F.  Approvals Required for Backflow Prevention Devices. 
1.  Each backflow prevention device shall be approved by the director of public works or his designee prior to installation and shall be installed by and at the expense of the consumer. Backflow devices shall not be approved unless the device has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association and has received the approval of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control Research of the University of Southern California. The type of protective device required shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists. The type of protection shall in no case be less stringent than that listed in Table 1, Section 7604 of Title 17 of the California Administrative Code, entitled "Type of Backflow Protection Required." The director of public works or his designee shall approve the model and size of any required device prior to installation. 
2.  Prior approval must be obtained from the director of public works or his designee before a backflow prevention device is removed, relocated or replaced.

The demand shall be made in writing to the water division, and shall be accompanied by a fee set by ordinance or resolution. 
B.  Upon receipt of the demand it shall be the duty of the water division to cause the meter to be examined and tested for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it is registering correctly the water being delivered through it. If, on the examination and test, the meter is found to register over two percent more water than actually passes through it, another meter will be substituted therefor, and the fee paid shall be repaid to the person making the application, and the water bill for the current period adjusted in such a manner as the director of public works may deem fair and just. If the meter is found to register not over two percent fast, the fee shall not be refunded to the customer and the water bills paid as rendered.

The facing and backing of such walls shall be bonded so that not less than four percent of the exposed face area is composed of solid headers extending not less than four inches into the backing. The distance between adjacent full-length headers shall not exceed twenty-four inches vertically or horizontally. Where the backing consists of two or more wythes the header shall extend not less than four inches into the most distant wythe, or the backing wythes shall be bonded together with separate headers whose area and spacing conform to the foregoing. 
b.  Tension stresses due to seismic forces normal to the wall may be neglected if the walls do not exceed the height to thickness ratio in Table 15.06.080 A and the in-plane shear stresses due to seismic loads do not exceed those set forth in Table 15.06.080 B. 
c.  If the wall height-thickness ratio exceeds the specified limits, the wall may be supported by vertical bracing members designed in accordance with Section 15.06.070. The deflection of such bracing member at design load shall not exceed one-tenth of the wall thickness. 
d.  Exception. The wall may be supported by flexible vertical bracing members designed in accordance with Section 15.06.070 (B) if the deflection at design loads is not less than one-quarter nor more than one-third of the wall thickness. 
e.  All vertical bracing members shall be attached to floor and roof construction for their design loads independently of required wall anchors. Horizontal spacing of vertical bracing members shall not exceed one-half of the wall height nor ten feet. 
f.  The wall height may be measured vertically to bracing elements other than a floor or roof. Spacing of the bracing elements and wall anchors shall not exceed six feet. Bracing elements shall be detailed to minimize the horizontal displacement of the wall by components of vertical displacements of the floor or roof. 
2.  Existing Roof, Floors, Walls, Footings and Wood Framing. Existing materials, including wood shear walls, utilized in the described configuration may be used as part of the lateral load resisting system, provided that the stresses in these materials do not exceed the values shown in Table 15.06.080 C.

1.  General Provisions. All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry vertical loads and seismic forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane shall be tested as specified in this subsection. All masonry quality shall equal or exceed the minimum standards established herein or shall be removed and replaced with new materials. The quality of mortar in all masonry walls shall be determined by performing in-place shear tests or by testing eight inch diameter cores. Alternative methods of testing may be approved by the director of building and safety. Nothing shall prevent pointing with mortar of the masonry wall joints before the tests are first made. Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints must be raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for pointing shall be type S or N except that masonry cements shall be used. All preparation and pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection of a registered deputy building inspector. At the conclusion of the inspection, the inspector shall submit a written report to the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth the result of the work inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the director of building and safety for approval as part of the structural analysis. All testing shall be performed in accordance with the requirements specified in this subsection by a testing agency approved by the director of building and safety. An accurate record shall be kept of all such tests and of their locations in the building, and these results shall be submitted to the director of building and safety for approval as part of the structural analysis. 
2.  Number and Location of Tests. The minimum number of tests shall be two per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force, or one per one thousand five hundred square feet of wall surface, with a minimum of eight tests in any case. The exact test or core location shall be determined at the building site by the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the subject building. 
3.  In-place Shear Tests. The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. The minimum quality mortar in eighty percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of thirty psi plus the axial stress in the wall at the point of the test. The shear stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed joints and shall be that at which movement of the brick is first observed. 
4.  Core Tests. A minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the number of required cores shall be prepared from the cores and tested as specified herein. The mortar joint of the outer wythe of the masonry core shall be tested in shear by placing the circular core section in a compression testing machine with the mortar bed joint rotated fifteen degrees from the axis of the applied load. The mortar joint tested in shear shall have an average ultimate stress of twenty psi based on the gross area. The average shall be obtained from the total number of cores made. If test specimens cannot be made from cores taken, then the shear value shall be reported as zero. 
F.  Testing of Shear Bolts. One-fourth of all new shear bolts and dowels embedded in unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested by a registered deputy inspector using a calibrated torque wrench to the following minimum torques: 
	
½? diameter bolts or dowels = 	40 foot-lbs. 
5/8 ? diameter bolts or dowels = 	50 foot-lbs. 
¾? diameter bolts or dowels = 	60 foot-lbs. 
 
No bolts exceeding three-quarters of an inch shall be used. All nuts shall be installed over malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood and heavy cut washers when bearing on steel. 
G.  Determination of Allowable Stresses for Design Methods Based on Test Results. 
1.  Design Shear Values. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall be substantiated by tests performed as specified in Section 15.06.080 E 3 and 4. Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in accordance with Table 15.06.080 B. Intermediate values between three and ten psi may be interpolated. 
2.  Design Compression and Tension Values. Compression stresses for unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of three psi shall not exceed one hundred psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be permitted. 
H.  Five percent of the existing rod anchors utilized as all or part of the required wall anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved testing laboratory. The minimum number tested shall be four per horizontal assembly, with two tests at walls with joists framing into the wall and two tests at walls with joists parallel to the wall. The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested. The rod anchor shall be given a preload of three hundred pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load reported shall be recorded at one-eighth inch relative movement of the anchor and the adjacent masonry surface. Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall include the test results as related to the wall thickness and joist orientation. The allowable resistance value of the existing anchors shall be forty percent of the average of those tested anchors having the same wall thickness and joist orientation. 
I.  Qualification tests for new devices used for wall anchorage shall be tested with the entire tension load carried on the enlarged head at the exterior face of the wall. Bond on the part of the device between the enlarged head and the interior wall face shall be eliminated for the qualification tests. The resistance value assigned the device shall be twenty percent of the average of the ultimate loads.

Article I. - General Provisions 
 
15.40.010 - Statutory authority. 
The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city ordains the provisions set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 2429 § 1, 1988)  
15.40.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and which inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses than are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2429 § 1(A), 1988)  
15.40.030 - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
G.  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2429 § 1(B), 1988)  
15.40.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

4.  Require within zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
C.  Elevation and Floodproofing. 
1.  New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base floor elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(3) of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
2.  New construction and substantial improvement of any structure in Zone AH or AO shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(3) of this section. Upon completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
4.  Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exist of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or 
b.  Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
5.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.40.190 of this article. 
(Ord. 2429 § 5(A), 1988)  
15.40.170 - Utility design and location standards.

D.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
E.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. 2429 § 5(C), 1988)  
15.40.190 - Manufactured homes and additions. 
All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to manufactured homes shall: 
A.  Be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; and 
B.  Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. 
(Ord. 2429 § 5(D), 1988)  
15.40.200 - Designation of floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.40.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(Ord. 2429 § 5(E), 1988)  
15.40.210 - Flood-related erosion-prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community. 
B.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
C.  Within Zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. 2429 § 5(F), 1988)  
Article VI. - Variance Procedure 
 
15.40.220 - Appeal board. 
A.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.  In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
D.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (B)(1) through (B)(11) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
E.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (B) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
F.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. 2429 § 6(A), 1988)  
15.40.230 - Issuance conditions. 
A.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
B.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
C.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
E.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections (A) through (D) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
F.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the Los Angeles County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety required that four and eight-tenths acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within this city be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.040 - Formula for dedication of land. 
A.  Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the environmental resource management element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, based on an adopted ratio of four and eight-tenths acres of park per one thousand persons (0.0048 per 1,000 people). The actual amount of land dedication required per development, per dwelling unit shall be as periodically set by resolution of the city council and according to Section 66477(a) of the Government Code. 
B.  Dedication of land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 17.16.100 (Procedure). 
C.  The subdivider shall, without credit: 
1.  Provide full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to this section; 
2.  Provide for fencing, as determined necessary by the city, along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; 
3.  Provide improved drainage through the site; 
4.  Provide other minimal improvements, including rough grading, which the city council determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes. 
D.  The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made pursuant to this section shall be approved by the director of parks, recreation and community services. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.050 - Formula for fees in-lieu of land. 
A.  General Formula. Where the proposed development is in close proximity to an already existing neighborhood park, as determined by the planning commission through the general plan, and if the already existing park is outside the proposed limits of the development, the developer will be required to make a cash payment, in-lieu of dedication, equal to the value of that land and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.16.070 (Amount of Fee in-lieu of Land Dedication), such fee to be used for a local park which bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being subdivided. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11) 
B.  Fees in-lieu of landFifty parcels or less. 
1.  If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed subdivision, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.16.070 (Amount of Fee in-lieu of Land Dedication). 
2.  However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreational purposes in subdivisions of fifty parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city council. 
C.  Use of Money. The money collected under this section shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating existing park and recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. 
D.  Sample computation of Quimby Act Fee. 
1.  2.0 (estimated average persons per unit in the city) x 0.0048 (acreage per person per 1,000 people) = 0.0096 acres (park dedication per person) 
2.  0.0096 acres (total park dedication per person) x 100 (total units within subdivision) = 0.96 acres (total park dedication) 
3.  0.96 acres (total park dedication) x $2,000,000 (appraised land value per acre) = $1,920,000 (total land value of dedication) 
4.  $1,920,000 (total land value of dedication)/100 (total units) = $19,200 per unit in park fees 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.060 - Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. 
In subdivisions of more than fifty parcels, the subdivider shall dedicate land and/or pay a fee in-lieu thereof in accordance with one or more of the appropriate provisions contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.070 - Amount of fee in-lieu of land dedication. 
When a fee is to be paid in-lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section 17.16.040 (Formula for Dedication of Land), plus corresponding fees as periodically set by resolution of the city council; or 
In the alternative, the amount of such fee shall be an amount equal to the fee established by city council resolution and assessed pursuant to Subsections A(4) of Section 3.48.080 (Imposition and Payment of Fees) of Chapter 3.48 (Development Impact Fees) of Title 3 (Revenue and Finance). 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.075 - Appeal of in-lieu fee calculation. 
The decision of the director with regard to the appropriate amount of the fee in-lieu of land dedication, pursuant to Section 17.16.070 (Amount of Fee in-lieu of Land Dedication) may be appealed in writing to the city manager within fifteen calendar days of the decision. The decision of the city manager shall be final, unless appealed in writing to the city council within fifteen calendar days of the city manager's decision. All decisions of the city council shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.080 - Determination of fair market value. 
The fair market value shall be determined by the city with a written professional appraisal report prepared and signed by a licensed appraiser acceptable to the city. The appraisal shall be made within thirty days immediately prior to the filing of the final map to the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.090 - Credit for common open space. 
A.  No credit shall be given for common open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. Where common open space usable for active recreational purposes is provided in a proposed planned development or real estate development as defined in Sections 11003 and 11003.1 of the Business and Professions Code, partial credit, not to exceed twenty-five percent may be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in-lieu thereof if the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so. 
B.  The following standards will be utilized to determine the amount of credit given: 
1.  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such common open space; and 
2.  Facilities proposed for open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the Environmental Resource Management Element of the General Plan of the city; 
3.  Proposed common open space shall be usable and accessible by the general public. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.100 - Procedure. 
A.  At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the city council shall determine pursuant to Section 17.16.040 (Formula for Dedication of Land) the land required for dedication. If the city council requires in-lieu fee payment by the subdivider, the city council will set the amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based at the time of final map approval. 
B.  At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the city council. Where the city council has determined that fees shall be paid in-lieu of or in addition to the dedication of land, the city council shall set the in-lieu fees based on the land dedication requirements as established at the time of tentative map approval using current land values at the time of final map approval. The subdivider shall pay said fees in accordance with the following schedule: 
1.  For any subdivision consisting of nine or less lots, fees shall be paid, in their entirety, prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any lot in the subdivision. 
2.  For any subdivision consisting of ten or more lots, fees shall be paid on a lot-by-lot basis prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any one of the lots in the subdivision. 
C.  Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final subdivision map or parcel map. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.110 - Disposition of fees. 
A.  Fees determined pursuant to Section 17.16.070 (Amount of Fee in-lieu of Land Dedication) shall be paid to the city clerk-treasurer and shall be deposited into the subdivision park trust fund, or its successor. Money in said fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition or development of park land, or improvements thereto. 
B.  Collected fees shall be appropriated by the local agency to which the land or fees are conveyed within five years upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision. 
C.  The city clerk-treasurer shall report to the city council at least annually on income expenditures, and status of the subdivision park trust fund. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.120 - Exemptions. 
A.  Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. 
B.  The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivision; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.130 - Subdivider-provided park and recreation improvements. 
The value of park and recreation improvements provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land shall be credited against the fees or dedication of land required by this chapter. The city council reserves the right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land improvements be unacceptable. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.16.140 - Agency to accept land or fee. 
Land or fees required under this chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the local public agency which provides park and recreational services on a community-wide level and to the area within which the proposed development will be located, if such agency elects to accept the land or fee. At the time of tentative map approval, the city council shall determine whether the city is the appropriate local agency. The city shall develop a schedule pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code specifying how, when and where it will use the land and/or fees to develop park or recreational facilities to serve residents of the subdivision.

17.18.020 - Authority to remove encroachments. 
A.  The city engineer, or his/her designee, may immediately and summarily abate, remove, or by notice may require the removal of any of the following encroachments: 
1.  Any encroachment which prevents and/or interferes with the use of any public right-of-way by the public; 
2.  Any encroachment which consists of refuse, trash, garbage, construction debris, or containers for refuse, trash, garbage, or construction debris (except for garbage receptacles on designated trash pick-up days or in connection with official trash collection); 
3.  Any encroachment which presents a potential traffic hazard; 
4.  Any encroachment of public property. 
B.  The city engineer may return such encroachment to its owner, or otherwise dispose of it at his/her discretion, except that if the city engineer determines in good faith that the encroachment is of more than nominal value or is of significant personal value, he/she shall not effect such other disposition until he/she has made a reasonable attempt to identify and notify the owner of the encroachment and provide a reasonable time, but not less than ten days, for the owner to retrieve it under provisions of this chapter. The return of such encroachment may be conditioned upon payment of an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for the expenses of removal, storage and any damage caused by the encroachment. If the encroachment is not claimed or the costs paid within said reasonable time, the encroachment shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be sold, destroyed, or transferred to the city for public use. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.18.030 - Notice to remove encroachment. 
The city engineer may, by notice, require the removal of any encroachment not specified in Section 17.18.020 (Authority to Remove Encroachments) of this chapter from any public right-of-way or public property. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)

The notice referred to in Sections 17.18.020 (Authority to Remove Encroachments), 17.18.030 (Notice to Remove Encroachment) and 17.18.070 (Notice of Seizure and Hearing) of this chapter shall be served upon the occupant or owner of the land, or the person causing, controlling or owning the encroachment, or shall be left at the place of residence or business of such occupant, owner or person if such place is in the city. If the person upon whom notice is to be served does not reside or do business in the city, the notice shall be prominently posted on the encroachment. The notice shall specify the breadth of the public right-of-way or public property, the place and extent of the encroachment, and shall require the removal of such encroachment within forty-eight hours or such longer period of time as the city engineer deems appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.18.050 - Removal of encroachment at owner's expense. 
A.  If the property owner (or person responsible for the encroachment) admits or fails to deny, within the time provided in Section 17.18.020(B) of this chapter, that an encroachment exists under Section 17.18.020 (Authority to Remove Encroachments) or 17.18.030 (Notice to Remove Encroachment) of this chapter, and if the encroachment is not removed within the time period set forth on the notice from and after service or posting of the notice, the city may remove the encroachment at the expense of the owner of the encroachment, the owner of the land, or any other person causing or allowing the encroachment to exist. 
B.  The city at its discretion may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies, to which the city may be entitled, for the collection of unpaid costs for the abatement of the encroachment. Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the pursuit of any other remedies. All remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive. 
C.  The cost of abatement of an encroachment of public property, after its final confirmation by the city, may constitute a special assessment against any private real property to which it relates, and, after the recording of the order of confirmation in the official records of the county recorder's office as thus made and confirmed, it shall constitute a lien on the property in the amount of the assessment. A copy of the order and report shall be transmitted to the assessor and tax collector for the city, whereupon it shall be the duty of the assessor and tax collector to add the amounts of the assessment, or assessments, to the next regular bills of ad valorem taxes levied against the respective lot and parcels of land, and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary ad valorem property taxes are collected. 
D.  Any responsible person who has unpaid and/or delinquent abatement costs, may be refused the issuance of a land use approval, or other city approval pertaining to the property, real or personal, that is the subject of the abatement costs pursuant to this chapter. 
E.  Any abatement costs required by the provisions of this chapter shall be paid or deposited with the city clerk-treasurer.

Costs of the abatement shall be recovered by the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.18.070 - Notice of seizure and hearing. 
A.  Whenever the city engineer, or his/her designee summarily abates an encroachment, as specified in Section 17.18.020 (Authority to Remove Encroachments) of this chapter, and the ownership of that encroachment is known or can be readily determined from identification on the encroachment, then the city engineer shall provide the owner of the encroachment with post-abatement notice and an opportunity for a hearing to determine the validity of the seizure. The owner of the encroachment and/or real property associated with the encroachment, or any person in possession or claiming any legal or equitable interest in any property which is the subject of a summary abatement pursuant to this chapter, may challenge the city engineer's determination to abate and/or the imposition of fees at a post-abatement hearing. A challenge shall be timely only if filed in writing to the city engineer within ten calendar days from and after the abatement, setting forth the grounds for the challenge. 
B.  Notice of such abatement shall be mailed or personally delivered to the registered and legal owners of the property and/or the encroachment within forty-eight hours of the abatement, excluding weekends and holidays, and shall include the following information: 
1.  The name, address and telephone number of the city engineer;

C.  Failure of either the owner or other interested party, or his/her agent, to request or to attend a hearing as scheduled shall satisfy the post-storage validity hearing requirement of this section. 
D.  The city shall be responsible for the cost incurred for abating the encroachment if it is determined at the hearing that probable cause for the abatement cannot be established. Any part of the encroachment that the city engineer determined in good faith is of more than nominal value, or of significant personal value, shall be returned to the owner in the event the abatement is found not to have been supported by probable cause. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.18.080 - Abatement and costsPost-abatement hearing. 
A.  Upon receipt of a timely written challenge, the city engineer shall set a date for a post-abatement hearing, but in any event no later than twenty calendar days from the date the city engineer receives the request, unless waived by the party requesting the hearing. A filing and processing fee, if required by resolution of the city council, shall be paid contemporaneously by the requesting party with the filing of the request. The city engineer may authorize a city officer or employee, independent contractor, or other designated individual to conduct the hearing, so long as the hearing officer is not the same person who directed the storage of the encroachment. The city engineer shall issue a determination on the challenge within ten calendar days of the hearing, and shall notify the party requesting the hearing in writing. 
B.  The decision of the city engineer following the hearing may be appealed to the city manager. Within five calendar days after the giving of the notice, any person aggrieved by the city engineer's determination may appeal it to the city manager in the time and in the manner prescribed in this section. Any such appeal shall be in writing, and shall be filed with the city clerk-treasurer within the time permitted by this section. At the time of the filing, the appealing party shall deposit with the city clerk-treasurer a filing and processing fee if required by resolution of the city council. Thereafter, the city clerk-treasurer shall transmit to the city manager the city engineer's determination, a summary of the evidence presented to the city engineer at the post-abatement hearing, and copies of any written material submitted at the hearing held by the hearing officer. The city manager shall set a time and place for hearing upon the appeal, and at the time and place shall consider the documents transmitted from the city clerk-treasurer, as well as any documents or argument presented at the hearing by any interested party. The city manager shall, thereafter, uphold, or modify the determination of the city engineer; and issue a determination on the appeal, in writing to the appellant, within five calendar days of the hearing on the appeal and shall include citation to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. The determination of the city manager shall be final and conclusive. Any action to review the decision of the city manager shall be commenced no later than the time period set forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6.

17.20.030 - Permit or approval. 
A.  No permit shall be issued or approval granted necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title if it is determined that development of such real property is contrary to public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant was the owner of the real property at the time of such violation or whether the applicant is the current owner of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of said applicant's interest in such real property. 
B.  If a permit or approval is granted, such additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property may be imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.20.040 - Notice of violation. 
A.  Notice of Intention.

The date set for the meeting before the planning commission shall be no sooner than thirty days and no later than sixty days from the date of mailing of the notice of intention. 
B.  Planning Commission Meeting; Notice of Violation. If at the scheduled hearing, the owner of the real property fails to object to recording the notice of violation, the planning commission shall direct the recording of the notice of violation with the county recorder. If, after the owner has presented evidence, it is determined that there has been no violation, the director shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record. If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the planning commission determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the planning commission shall direct the recording of the notice of violation with the Los Angeles County Recorder. The notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such property. 
(Ord. No. 2976, § 1, 7-26-11)  
17.20.050 - Penalties.

18.10.040 - Optional development standards. 
Optional development standards, when allowed in this chapter, are intended to provide better quality of design than could be achieved through the use of the basic development standards and design guidelines indicated in Sections 18.20.020, 18.20.030, 18.22.020, 18.22.030, 18.48.070(C), 18.48.070(D), 18.48.070(M) and 18.76.030(A) and Division VI. Optional standards allow the use of more creative design, while maintaining the quality of development and the character of the adjacent and surrounding neighborhood. This section is not to be construed as a substitute for the variance procedure detailed in Chapter 18.52. The following optional development standards may be employed: 
A.  A development review application may be approved, utilizing optional development standards, notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, and to the exclusion of the zoning regulations applicable to the lot by reason of its underlying zone classification, provided: 
1.  That the approval is consistent with the public peace, health, safety and general welfare; and 
2.  That the development proposed is consistent with the city's general plan and any applicable specific plan relating to the areas included within such plan; and 
3.  That the development will be in substantial compliance with the purpose and intent of the zoning regulations; and 
4.  The approving body or zoning administrator shall make a specific finding as a condition of approval that the optional standards being approved shall increase the quality of the project by achieving greater than minimum standard requirements provided by this code.

18.10.050 - Minimum residential density. 
The provisions within the general plan pertaining to minimum density within the R-2, R-3, and R-4 residential zones may be waived or modified by the planning commission when it can be demonstrated that the minimum density requirements cannot be provided because of unusual circumstances associated with the property due to one or more of the following conditions: 
A.  The topography of the property cannot be altered in a practical manner to accommodate the minimum density requirement. 
B.  The minimum density cannot be physically developed on the project site without the approval of a variance because the existing property does not comply with the city's minimum required lot size, depth and/or width requirements. 
C.  The new construction would necessitate the removal or significant alteration of existing on-site structures and/or cannot be physically integrated onto the existing property without the approval of a variance or deviation from Health and Safety Codes. 
D.  The property is eligible for or listed on a local, state or national historic register or is a contributing resource within an historic district and the minimum density requirements would adversely impact the historic setting, structure(s) or feature(s) of the property in such a manner as to adversely diminish the site's historic significance or value. 
E.  The property has one or more significant easement(s) on the property that cannot be relocated, modified or abandoned and therefore reduces the functional building area on the property to develop residential dwelling units. 
(Ord. 2873 § 1, 2006)

Further, in that regard, should any conflict arise in the application of various provisions of the city's zoning regulations for any hillside area or areas, the planning commission and city council shall give preference to the need to vigorously protect the natural environment of the hillside against change. 
(Prior code § 9165)  
18.14.020 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to those properties designated in this chapter as being included within a "hillside area." For the purposes of this chapter, the phrase "hillside area" means and refers to all real property as is shown on those certain maps attached to the ordinance codified in this section, incorporated herein by reference and entitled, "Hillside and Biological Sensitivity Areas  city of Whittier Zoning Regulations, Division G, Part 4, Chapter 1, Article IX, Whittier Municipal Code, October 23, 1979." The zoning map shall be amended to show the properties which have been classified in the hillside area by adding the zoning designation, on each such property, of "HR." 
(Prior code § 9166)  
18.14.030 - Permitted uses. 
No person shall use, nor shall any property owner permit, the use of any lot classified in zone H-R for any use other than the following: 
A.  Principal Uses. 
1.  One single-family dwelling; 
2.  Recreational facilities for the exclusive use of the residents of a development, designated as such on an approved plan; 
3.  Those uses allowed in zone R-E for which a conditional use permit is required, pursuant to Section 18.52.030; and 
4.  Residential care facilities, as defined in Section 18.06.369 of this code, serving six or fewer persons. 
B.  Accessory Uses. Those accessory uses expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 18.10 of this code. 
(Ord. 2897 § 10, 2008)  
18.14.040 - Development planRequired. 
No building permit shall be issued for any building or structure proposed to be located on any real property classified in the H-R zone unless and until a hillside development plan (in this chapter, "plan"), therefor is first approved in the time and manner set forth in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 9168)  
18.14.050 - Development planCompliance. 
Where a plan is approved, no building or structure shall be constructed, erected, located or maintained upon any lot to which such plan applies, unless such building or structure is in compliance with the approved plan. No building permit shall be issued for any building or structure to be located upon any lot as to which such plan applies unless and until the director finds the same to be consistent and compatible with the applicable approved plan. 
(Prior code § 9169)  
18.14.060 - Development planApplication. 
Where a plan is required pursuant to this chapter, an application for approval of such a plan shall contain the following:

(Prior code § 9169.1)  
18.14.070 - Development standardsApplicability. 
The provisions of this title shall apply to all uses, buildings and structures located or constructed in any H-R zone, except as expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 9169.2)  
18.14.080 - Development standardsCompliance. 
All uses of property within the H-R zone shall comply with the following development standards: 
A.  Compliance with Plan. Each use, building and/or structure shall be constructed, located and thereafter maintained in compliance with the approved plan; and 
B.  Compliance with Regulations. Each use, building and/or structure shall be constructed, located and thereafter maintained in compliance with the regulations set forth in this title, including but not limited to Chapter 18.10; and 
C.  Density Regulations. Property classified in zone H-R may have and maintain not to exceed the number of dwelling units permitted by the following formula. However, under no circumstances may the yield per net acre exceed three units: 
Yield per Net Acre (see also Appendix A of this chapter, "Slope Density Chart"). 
Y = 4.03 - 0.06857 × S) 
"Y" is the maximum number of residential dwelling units per net acre. 
"S" is the average slope of the parcel in percent as established in Section 18.14.080D7. 
"4.03" is where Line A intersects the ordinate line in Appendix A. 
".06857" is the slope of Line A in Appendix A. 
The above formula is based on the natural average percentage of slope for the various parcels as shown on the map referenced in Section 18.14.020. 
D.  Grading. No person shall permit or allow any grading, as that phrase is defined in subdivision 1 of this subsection, upon any property classified in zone H-R, except in compliance with the following: 
1.  For the purposes of this chapter, "grading" means any excavating or filling or combination thereof involving the removal, movement or relocation of dirt by hydraulic or mechanical means, except for that necessary for landscaping or maintenance of yards, unless such work changes the finished contours in a manner which would cause surface water to flow onto adjacent public or private properties. A grading plan therefor has been lawfully issued pursuant to Section 18.14.150 of this chapter; and 
2.  All graded slopes are contoured and blended to harmonize with natural slopes; and 
3.  Each building and structure is designed to fit, as closely as possible, the natural landform, through the use of split-level house designs and other similar techniques; and 
4.  The maximum vertical height of cuts or fills, exposed or retained by walls, from toe to top, shall not exceed twenty feet, except this provision shall not apply to slopes created by grading for streets, as specifically approved on a plan. However, the intent of minimizing manmade slopes shall be the guiding factor in creating streets; and 
5.  The maximum steepness of cuts and fills shall not exceed 2:1; and 
6.  Building sites shall not be pregraded until specific house-site plans and elevations have been approved for each individual site; and 
7.  Average Slope. 
a.  If the "average slope" of a property, as defined in this chapter, is between one percent and fifty percent, the following schedule shall be utilized to determine the maximum percentages of the ground surfaces of the site that may be graded as approved as part of the plan. All sloping areas of the site which are fifty percent or greater shall not be graded except to correct previous grading, landslide or unstable soil areas, and therefore shall not be included for the purpose of applying the following slope averaging formula to establish which areas may be graded. In no event may the area of a slope which was fifty percent or greater, on the date the application was submitted, be built upon even if these areas have had corrective grading which results in slopes less than fifty percent, except that the city council may allow grading for streets in such an area, but only if it finds that such streets are necessary for primary access to a developable area. 
Slope Average Formula 
Where the average percent of the natural slope (exclusive of slopes fifty percent or greater) of the land is: 	The maximum percent of the site which may be graded (this includes grading for streets) is: 
1.0% to 14.9% 	80% 
15.0 to 17.4 	70 
17.5 to 19.9 	66 
20.0 to 22.4 	60 
22.5 to 24.9 	55 
25.0 to 27.4 	50 
27.5 to 29.9 	45 
30.0 to 32.4 	40 
32.5 to 34.9 	35 
35.0 to 37.4 	30 
37.5 to 39.9 	25 
40.0 to 42.4 	20 
42.5 to 44.9 	15 
45.0 to 47.4 	10 
47.5 to 49.9 	5 
50.0 and over 	(No grading except as provided expressly in this chapter) 
 
b.  The "average slope" of a parcel of land or any portion thereof shall be computed by applying the following formula to the natural slope of the land, before any grading is commenced. For the purpose of establishing density yield for any given parcel as referenced in subsection C of this section, the formula comprising Appendix A, entitled Slope Density Chart, shall be applied to the entire parcel being considered for development. For the purpose of determining which areas of the site may be graded, the following formula shall be applied only to those portions of the site with less than a fifty-percent slope. 
S = 0.00229 IL 
A 
Where: 	S 	= 	Average percent slope 
	I 	= 	Contour interval, in feet 
	L 	= 	Summation of length of all contours, in fee 
	A 	= 	Area of land being considered, in acres 
 
c.  "Natural slope" means areas which have not been previously significantly graded, or where there is no landslide activity. 
E.  Potential Hazard Areas. No building or structure shall be located on property which is within any area described on the map referred to in Section 18.14.020 as a "potential hazard area," unless a competent geologic report unequivocally shows that the proposed placement of the specific buildings and/or structures can be safely accomplished. 
F.  Natural Features. Each applicant submitting the plan shall specifically describe thereon all of the property proposed for development which is included within a "major ridge line," or within a "major flora and fauna area." The delineation shall be based upon the designation of such "major ridge lines" and/or "major flora and fauna areas," as referred to in the map referenced in Section 18.14.020. No building or structure shall be located, constructed or maintained on any property designated as the site of a "major ridge line," or a "major flora and fauna area" on an approved plan, except that streets, ways and emergency vehicular access routes may, if necessary for primary access to developable areas, be located thereon so long as the city council finds that the location of any such facilities will not cause biological damage to those areas, or any other area necessary to the continued survival of plant and animal population in those areas. 
1.  Those areas shown as "moderate sensitivity" on the map referred to in Section 18.14.020, labeled as "biological sensitivity," shall be given special consideration so as to retain these areas to the maximum extent possible. Consideration shall be given and findings made as to the relationship between all biological and wildlife corridor areas, major ridge lines, and the proposed development during approval of a plan. 
2.  Since it is required that even ridge lines not specified as major ridge lines in this subsection may be aesthetically important and warrant protection, specific development guidelines for all such ridge lines shall be formulated at the hillside-plan level of development based upon the specific ridge line and the type and extent of individual development. 
3.  With respect to hillside areas proposed for development in the future, and for which major ridge lines and major flora and fauna areas have not yet been designated, the planning commission and city council shall utilize criteria for making such designations which afford environmental protection to at least the same extent as that now provided in areas for which such designations are made in this subsection. 
G.  Fire Protection. Because all of the properties classified within the H-R zone are in areas designated as high fire-risk areas, the following fire protection measures shall be observed and maintained for each dwelling unit: 
1.  Each habitable structure shall be provided with fire-retardant roof covering consistent with the provisions of the city's building regulations; and 
2.  Around each habitable structure, there shall be an area cleared of native brush to a minimum twenty-foot radius from the structure. Such area shall be replanted with perennial grasses or other fire-resistant plants or ground cover and continually maintained, and shall be provided with automatic sprinkler systems; and 
3.  As determined by the fire chief, all brush shall be removed and cleared within twenty feet of each side of every roadway. This includes all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth. This provision shall not apply, however, to single specimen trees, ornamental shrubbery, and cultivated ground cover, such as grass, ivy, succulents, or other similar plants used as ground cover, provided they do not form a means of readily transmitting fire. 
H.  Erosion Control. To prevent damage by reason of erosion of land, the following standards shall be observed in all H-R zones: 
1.  All manufactured slopes shall be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm- runoff erosion, in a manner approved by the director of parks, within thirty days of the completion of the grading. Planting shall be designed to blend the slope in with the surrounding terrain and development; and 
2.  Permanent irrigation systems shall be provided to insure the proper maintenance of the planted areas; and 
3.  Each plan shall provide a suitable method for insuring compliance with landscaping and irrigation plans, which shall be approved as a part of such plan for all manufactured slopes and recreation areas. 
I.  Off-Street Parking. Each residential unit located within the H-R zone shall be provided, permanently, with two off-street parking spaces, constructed and maintained in accordance with the parking development standards set forth in Chapter 18.48. In addition, there shall be provided one additional off-street parking space per dwelling unit located within a minimum of one hundred fifty feet from the unit served thereby. 
(Prior code § 9169.3)  
18.14.090 - ApplicationFees. 
Applications for plans shall be filed with the director, and shall consist of the following: 
A.  The material required pursuant to Section 18.14.060; and

18.14.110 - ApplicationHearingApproval or denial. 
A.  At least ten days in advance of the time set for consideration by the commission, the director shall give written notice of the time and place of such hearing to the applicant, and to all persons owning property within three hundred feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved in the proposed plan. If the commission finds that the plan as submitted: 
1.  Is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and 
2.  Is consistent with the subdivision and zoning regulations and the general plan; and 
3.  Is compatible with present and future development of the property within the immediate vicinity; it shall recommend to the city council approval of the plan. The commission may also recommend conditions to be imposed upon such approval, if it deems the same appropriate. If the commission finds, as a result of its consideration of the plan, that the same does not comply with subdivisions A1, A2 or A3 of this section, it shall deny the plan. 
B.  In cases of denial, the commission's action shall be final and conclusive, unless the applicant appeals the same to the city council by filing a written letter of appeal with the city clerk-treasurer, together with a filing and processing fee in an amount set by council resolution, appealing such decision to the city council. Such an appeal shall be filed in the time and manner provided in Section 18.14.120. 
(Prior code § 9169.6)  
18.14.120 - Appeal proceduresConditions. 
A.  Upon the receipt by the city clerk-treasurer of an appeal in the case of a denial, or a copy of the commission's resolution recommending approval of a plan, the city clerk-treasurer shall set the same for consideration by the council at its next most convenient meeting. The city clerk-treasurer shall give notice in accordance with Section 18.14.110 of the time and place set for hearing thereof by the council. At such time and place the council shall consider the commission's files and all applicable staff reports, and any relevant evidence offered by any person, and determine whether the commission's action should be approved, modified or disapproved. The action of the council shall be based upon Section 18.14.110. 
B.  The council may, in the case of approval of a plan, condition the same in such manner as it deems necessary to insure compliance with the purpose and intent of Chapters 18.10 through 18.22. 
(Prior code § 9169.7)  
18.14.130 - HearingsParticipation by interested persons.

(Ord. No. 2948, § 1, 2-23-10)  
Chapter 18.36 - P PARKING OVERLAY ZONE 
Sections: 
 
18.36.010 - Created. 
There is created as an overlay zone, the "Parking Overlay Zone." Property shall be classified in such zone only in the manner specified in Chapter 18.60. When so classified, the same shall be noted on the zoning map by the symbol "P" in parentheses following the existing zoning classification of such property. 
(Prior code § 9450)  
18.36.020 - Permitted uses. 
When any lot is classified in the parking overlay zone it may be used, in lieu of the uses permitted by its underlying zone classification, exclusively for off-street parking purposes if such off-street parking facilities serve a principal use which is located on a lot which is within one hundred feet of the outer boundaries of the lot classified in the parking overlay zone. The following regulations shall apply to the use of a lot so classified: 
A.  All off-street parking facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18.48. 
B.  All required yard areas, as imposed by the zoning regulations applicable to such lot by reason of its underlying zone classification, shall be observed. All such required yard areas shall be landscaped and permanently maintained as such, including, but not limited to, the installation and maintenance of a permanent irrigation system. 
(Prior code § 9451)  
18.36.030 - Access. 
No lot shall be classified in the parking overlay zone unless vehicular and/or pedestrian access thereto is limited or restricted by conveyance of such access rights to the city, or otherwise, to insure a safe traffic flow and to insure that the use of such lot for off-street parking purposes will not unreasonably increase vehicular or pedestrian traffic on abutting streets serving residential areas. 
(Prior code § 9452)  
Chapter 18.38 - T TRANSITIONAL ZONE 
Sections: 
 
18.38.010 - Created. 
There is created the T "Transitional" zone. Property classified in the T zone by the map adopted pursuant to Section 18.08.020 may be developed for any use which is permitted in any other zone, subject to the provisions of Section 18.38.040. 
(Prior code § 9502)  
18.38.020 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to provide for an interim transitional zone classification for certain properties for the reasons set forth in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 9500)  
18.38.030 - Findings. 
The city council finds, determines and declares as follows: 
A.  That the city's staff and planning commission have recommended that former zone classifications of P and R-2-P should be eliminated and abolished; 
B.  That the determination was made as a result of staff and commission studies made as a part of the commission's recommendation relating to the revision of the city's zoning regulations and zoning map; 
C.  That there are approximately two hundred ninety parcels which are classified in either P or R-2-P zones, as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; 
D.  That the commission has initiated studies to determine the appropriate zone classification of each parcel so zoned; 
E.  That due to the number of parcels included with the zones, each study cannot be completed in less than four to six months; 
F.  That pending the completion and classification of such properties in appropriate zone designation, it is essential that the properties be placed in a transitional zone to permit the adoption of the new zoning regulations and map, which will allow the development of such properties on a parcel-by-parcel basis, upon application and receipt of a conditional use permit for any use sought to be placed on any of the certain parcels; 
G.  That many of the properties now zoned in either the "P" or "R-2-P" zones are, in fact, in a transitional state, and the classification and future use thereof will be determined in part by the classification placed on property immediately adjacent thereto, and other planning considerations; 
H.  That the only feasible way to permit development of the properties, pending the final review and study of the appropriate zone classification, is by means of the enactment of the provisions of this chapter requiring a conditional use permit for any development of the properties; 
I.  That by reason of the notice given, with reference to the planning commission hearing relating to revised zoning regulations and the zoning map, the properties now classified in zone P or zone R-2-P could, as a part of the review, be reclassified by adoption of a revised zoning map. The planning commission and council determined that separate reclassification proceedings were appropriate as to such properties, to insure that the views of the owners of such properties could be considered and evaluated; 
J.  That the public interest, convenience and necessity require enactment of the provisions of this chapter and its application to the properties referred to in this section. 
K.  In addition to the findings above set forth, the city council finds and determines that, with respect to properties which are located adjacent to railroad rights-of-way, because of the unique characteristics of such properties and the relationship of such properties to contiguous properties, traditional zoning does not function so as to allow the reasonable use of such properties consistent and compatible with adjacent properties.

18.41.020 - Findings and purpose. 
The city council finds and declares as follows: 
A.  The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and are consistent with all applicable laws of the State of California. 
B.  The city is authorized, by virtue of the Constitution of the State of California, and Section 51031 of the California Government Code, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards relative to the skill and experience of massage operators and massage technicians and imposing reasonable conditions on the operation of the massage establishment. 
C.  There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly trained and/or educated massage technicians and this chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss. 
D.  The courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity. There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments and the establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity. 
E.  The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are intended to reduce the burden of massage establishment regulation on the police department.

The planning commission or city council has the limited discretion to add appropriate and narrowly tailored conditions to the granting or modification of a permit pursuant to this chapter, should the particular facts and/or circumstances of a proposed use so justify. Other conditions may be added only because of some unique circumstances, such as the particular location or configuration of a specific adult business, so long as any additional conditions comply with the following requirements: 
1.  The condition is a content-neutral, time, place manner restriction, as those terms are recognized and interpreted in controlling court opinions and judicial precedent; or is specifically and narrowly aimed at lessening, mitigating or eradicating an identified, negative secondary effect of adult businesses; and 
2.  The condition is not based upon any anticipated or expected responses from viewers or those opposing the adult business; and

(Ord. No. 2919, §§ 1418, 2-10-09)  
18.44.210 - PermitDecision to grant or deny. 
A.  The planning commission ("commission") shall grant, conditionally grant, or deny an application for a permit under this chapter. An application shall be granted, or conditionally granted as necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, in accordance with the provisions of this section, if the locational requirements in Section 18.44.030 are met, the operating requirements in Sections 18.44.050, 18.44.070, 18.44.075, and 18.44.090 are met, and if the application complies with the requirements of Section 18.44.200. In addition to any failure to comply with those specified sections, a denial of a permit, in accordance with the procedural provisions of this section, may be based on, but is not limited to, the following additional considerations: 
1.  Any prior permit/license revocation(s) listed in the application, pursuant to Section 18.44.200(D)(1) and (2), depending on the nature of the permit(s) revoked, the nature of the violation(s) leading to the revocation(s), the total number or permit(s) revoked, and the date of the revocation(s); or 
2.  Any convictions or pleas of nolo contendere listed in the application, pursuant to Section 18.44.200(D)(3), including consideration of the nature of the conviction(s) or plea(s), the total number and the date of such conviction(s) or plea(s). The commission shall give great weight to conviction(s) or plea(s) for sex crimes or crimes involving moral turpitude; or 
3.  Any misrepresentation of material fact in the application or any question in the application is not answered truthfully, including failure to list any permit/license revocation(s), conviction(s) or plea(s) of nolo contendere required to be listed in the application pursuant to Section 18.44.200 D; or 
4.  That the permit applicant has failed to obtain or maintain all required city, county and state licenses and permits applicable to and required for the proposed use; or 
5.  That the proposed use, as proposed, will not comply with the current approved and adopted edition of the various Uniform Building, Uniform Fire, Uniform Electrical and Uniform Plumbing Codes adopted by the city to insure that the operation is not hazardous to the health or safety of the employees or patrons of the business or of the general public. 
B.  The completeness of an application shall be determined by the planning director within five working days of its submittal to the planning department, as required by Section 18.44.200 of this chapter. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the applicant shall be notified in writing that the application is not complete and the reasons therefor, including any additional information necessary to render the application complete. Such writing shall be deposited in U.S. mail, postage prepaid, immediately upon determination that the application is incomplete. Within five working days following the receipt of an amended application or supplemental information, the planning director shall again determine whether the application is complete in accordance with the procedures set forth above. If an amended application is not filed with the city within fifteen days of the date of the notice to the applicant that the application is incomplete, then such application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the applicant will be required to submit a new application to the city. 
C.  Upon the filing of a completed application, the commission shall cause to be made by its own members, or members of its staff, an appropriate investigation, including consultation with the building, police, fire and health departments and inspection of the premises as needed. Consultation or investigation are not grounds for the city to unilaterally delay in reviewing a completed application, nor is it grounds to extend the time period to conduct a hearing pursuant to this section or issuing a decision on the application. 
D.  If an application for an adult conditional use permit also requires design review board, as set forth in Section 18.44.070 of this code, the design review board shall also consider the application and issue a determination or decision on the design elements of a project to the planning commission within sixty days of the determination of a complete application. 
E.  The commission shall notice and conduct a public hearing within fifteen days of the determination of a complete application for those applications that do not require development review pursuant to Section 18.44.070(D). Notice of such hearing shall be made as set forth in California Government Code Sections 65091 and 65905. The applicant shall insure that any posted notices on the property for which the permit is sought shall remain posted during the time period provided for in Government Section 65091. 
F.  The commission shall notice and conduct a public hearing, within sixty days of: (1) the decision by the design review board for an application requiring development review pursuant to Section 18.44.070(C), or (2) within sixty days of the determination of a complete application for those applications that do not require development review pursuant to Section 18.44.070(D). Notice of such hearing shall be made as set forth in California Government Code Sections 65091 and 65905. The applicant shall insure that any posted notices on the property for which the permit is sought shall remain posted during the time period provided for in Government Section 65091. 
G.  The planning commission shall render a written decision on the application for an adult conditional use permit within two days of the public hearing required by this section. Such written decision shall include findings upon which the decision is based. 
H.  The failure of the commission to render any decision within the time frames established in any part of this section shall be deemed to constitute a denial. 
I.  The commission's decision shall be immediately hand delivered or immediately mailed to the applicant, and shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this code. 
J.  Notwithstanding any provisions in this chapter regarding the occurrence of any action within a specified period of time, the applicant may request additional time beyond that provided for in this chapter or may request a continuance regarding any decision or consideration by the city of the pending application. Extensions of time sought by applicants shall not be considered delay on the part of the city or constitute failure by the city to provide for prompt decisions on applications.

18.44.220 - Appeal. 
A.  Any interested person may appeal the decision of the commission to the city council in writing, such written appeal to be personally delivered to the city or postmarked within five days of the commission's written decision, or in the case of no written decision, within five days of any denial of a permit application by the commission. 
B.  Consideration of an appeal of the commission's decision shall be at a public hearing, notice of which shall be given pursuant to California Government Code Sections 65091 and 65905 and which hearing shall occur within fifteen days of the filing or initiation of the appeal. 
C.  The city council action on the appeal of the commission's decision shall be by a majority vote of the members present and upon the conclusion of the de novo public hearing, the city council shall grant, conditionally grant or deny the appeal. The city council's decision shall be final and conclusive and shall be rendered in writing within two days of the hearing, such written decision to be immediately mailed or hand delivered to the party appealing the commission's decision and to any other affected parties including the applicant if the appellant is not the applicant. Such written decision shall include findings upon which the decision is based. 
D.  In reaching its decision, the city council shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence. 
E.  Notwithstanding any provisions in this chapter regarding the occurrence of any action within a specified period of time, the applicant may request additional time beyond that provided for in this chapter or may request a continuance regarding any decision or consideration by the city of the pending appeal. Extensions of time sought by applicants shall not be considered delay on the part of the city or constitute failure by the city to provide for prompt decisions on applications. 
F.  The failure of the city council to render any decision within the time frames established in any part of this section shall be deemed to constitute a denial. 
G.  Each appeal from a denial or conditional approval of an adult conditional use permit shall be accompanied by a filing and processing fee in an amount as set by resolution of the city council. Any person appealing may withdraw the appeal by filing a written request to do so at any time prior to final action thereon, provided that there shall be no refund of fees.

The city shall make all reasonable effort to expedite such review and shall comply with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedures Section 1094.8 and/or any subsequent, applicable statutes or rules of the courts of law of the state or nation which specify the prompt judicial review to be provided to an adult entertainment permit applicant.

(Ord. No. 2919, § 22, 2-10-09)

7.  That the permitted business creates sound levels which violate any noise control ordinance of the city which may be in effect at the time of the violation(s); 
8.

Prior to any discretionary permit approval for a new or expanded wireless telecommunication facility, a radio-frequency (RF) report shall be prepared by a qualified, independent, RF engineer, acceptable to the director of community development, to document compliance. 
9.  All wireless telecommunication facilities shall be stealthed to eliminate or substantially reduce their visual and aesthetic impacts from the surrounding public rights-of-way and adjacent properties. To accomplish this goal, all wireless telecommunication facility antennas and supporting equipment shall be developed with the intent of locating and designing such facilities in the following manner and order of preference (from top to bottom). 
a.  Antennas: 
i)  Architecturally integrated within the internal framework of a building or structure whether existing, proposed, or as a building addition, so as to be completely obscured and non-visible from any public view. 
ii)  Located on the rooftop of a building and situated entirely below or internally within the building parapet wall so as to be entirely stealthed from any public view on the ground. 
iii)  Architecturally integrated within the internal framework of a new (functional or non-function) freestanding structure (i.e., a clock tower, water tower, freestanding sign, flag pole, cultural monument, etc.) that is compatible with the bulk, mass, scale and height of the surrounding buildings, structures or environmental features and does not eliminate any required on-site parking, landscaping or create the need for a setback variance. 
iv)  Mounted to an existing building/structure whereby the antennas are placed on the building or structure in such a manner so as to act as a decorative architectural feature of the building/structure it is located on. 
v)  On a "mono-tree" that is surrounded by a grove of living trees that have or will attain a future height (within fifteen years) that is generally comparable to the freestanding "mono-tree." Within a natural setting (i.e., a park, undeveloped hillside etc.) a "mono-rock" or faux rock outcropping may be considered when the topography or geology of the site has similar natural features. When a wireless telecommunication facility is located within a public park or along the Greenway Trail, a mono-tree shall be the primary design preference. 
vi)  On a "mono-pole" that is substantially screened from all public rights-of-way by a building, structure or object of a similar height and mass. 
b.  Telecommunication Facility Equipment: 
i)  Within an underground equipment vault. 
ii)  Incorporated inside of an existing or new building/structure or located entirely below a building roof parapet wall so as to be completely screened from public view on the ground. 
iii)  Ground mounted in a non-obtrusive location and enclosed by a decorative wall (not exceeding six feet high) or with another high quality screening material. Screen walls composed of chain-link, wood, metal or wire mesh are prohibited. 
c.  Site Selection Preferences: 
i)  On any city owned parcel of property. 
ii)  Co-located with an existing telecommunications facility or at a pre-approved location by the city of Whittier as part of a master plan of development for a wireless telecommunication facility provider in the city. 
iii)  In an industrial zone; 
iv)  In a commercial zone; 
v)  In a mixed-use development or building within a planned community or specific plan; 
vi)  Within a multi-family residential zone; 
B.  Development Criteria: 
1.  Setbacks. 
a.  All wireless telecommunication facilities (including all antennas and related accessory equipment cabinet(s)) shall meet all front, side and rear yard setback requirements of the zoning classification it is located in, except as identified otherwise within this chapter. However, the approval authority may designate greater setbacks so long as it does not disrupt the reception or transmission of wireless telecommunication signals. 
b.  Wireless telecommunication equipment cabinets may be located within any side or rear yard setback, if located entirely below ground, within a vault. 
c.  There shall be no new freestanding mono-poles or mono-trees located within a seven hundred fifty-foot radius of another such facility that is of the same general design or faux tree type, except on property owned by the city of Whittier. The approval authority many deem a lesser distance appropriate to avoid a coverage gap in a wireless telecommunication provider's system. 
2.  Building or Structure Height. 
a.  The maximum height for a new freestanding building or structure designed to accommodate a wireless telecommunication facility shall not exceed the maximum building height limit for the zoning classification of the property it is development on or seventy feet, which ever is less. In instances where the maximum building height for the zoning classification is less than seventy feet, the approval of a conditional use permit shall be required to enable a wireless telecommunication facility to be constructed up to seventy feet high. The maximum building height shall include all architectural features located above the actual placement of the wireless antennas. Additional building or structure height may be considered with the approval of a variance subject to meeting all of the following provisions: 
i)  It can be documented by a qualified, independent, RF engineer that there is no feasible alternative location or design that would allow the telecommunication facility to comply with the maximum building height limit without adversely impacting the ability of the wireless provider to receive and send communication signals. Alternatively, additional building height is necessary to be able to co-locate on an existing wireless telecommunication facility without interfering with the communication signals from an existing wireless provider. 
ii)  There are exceptional circumstances such as topography, existing vegetation or structures that require the telecommunication facility to exceed the underlying zoning classifications maximum building height limit. 
b.  Wireless telecommunication facilities employing mono-poles or mono-trees over forty feet in height shall be located within the rear one-half of the property, unless constructed on public property owned by the city of Whittier. In such case, the exact location shall be determined by the city's approval authority. 
3.  Lot Coverage. All freestanding, ground-mounted, wireless telecommunication facilities, including any related above-ground telecommunication equipment cabinet(s), shall be counted towards the maximum allowable lot coverage for the property the wireless telecommunication facility is developed on. 
4.  Landscaping. All wireless telecommunications facilities and related cellular equipment structures, vaults, and cabinets shall be surrounded by a minimum five-foot-wide, irrigated, landscape planter that is maintained in good condition at all times. 
5.  Fencing. All ground mounted wireless telecommunication facility equipment (except that located within an underground vault) shall be enclosed by a decorative block wall or other material deemed acceptable to the director of community development. In no case shall the decorative wall or fencing material exceed seven feet high. 
6.  Signage. 
a.  There shall be no on-site advertising or signage on any portion of a wireless telecommunication facility except that required by law, identified within this chapter and/or required by the city of Whittier. 
b.  Health and safety signage shall be conspicuously posted in locations near all access points into a wireless telecommunication facility that identify the minimum distance that should be maintained from all cellular antennas and equipment that have RF or electromagnetic radiation emissions. 
c.  A contact person and valid emergency phone number of the wireless telecommunication facility provider shall be conspicuously posted and kept current on wireless telecommunication facilities. 
7.  Lighting. No wireless telecommunication facility structure may be illuminated unless specifically required to do so by any applicable governmental agency that has regulatory authority over telecommunication facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2918, § 1, 2-10-09)  
18.47.070 - Design standards. 
The following general design standards shall be considered for regulating the location, design, and general aesthetics of all wireless telecommunication facilities: 
A.  Visual Impact. 
1.  All wireless telecommunication facilities shall be stealthed to eliminate or reduce their visual and aesthetic impacts from the surrounding public right(s)-of-way and adjacent properties. Where feasible and appropriate, all colors and designs shall be integrated and compatible with the surrounding on-site buildings. 
2.  No wireless telecommunication facility shall have a bright, shiny or reflective finish. All facilities shall be finished in a color to neutralize it and blend it with, rather than contrast it from, the sky and the on-site improvements immediately surrounding the facility. 
3.  In developing a wireless telecommunications facility, screening of the facility must take into account the existing improvements or natural features on or adjacent to the site including all landscaping, walls, fences, berms or other specially designed devices which preclude or minimize the visibility of the telecommunications facility and the grade of the site, as related to the surrounding grades of properties and public rights-of-way. 
4.  Compatible with the general mass and scale of any/all on-site and off-site buildings, poles and structures immediately surrounding the wireless telecommunications facility. 
5.  All new or modified wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed, whenever possible, to accommodate for the potential co-location of at least one additional wireless carrier on-site. 
6.  All ground mounted wireless telecommunication facility structures, equipment and other infrastructure shall be treated with an anti-graffiti material coating, where appropriate. 
7.

(Ord. No. 2937, § 1, 8-25-09)  
18.49.090 - Waivers. 
Modifications or waivers to the standards and provisions contained within this chapter may be granted by the planning commission, subject to the approval of a conditional use permit, if it is determined that the standards and/or provisions which are being requested to be altered or waived will not impact the public health, safety and welfare and are not contrary to the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2937, § 1, 8-25-09)

(Ord. No. 2937, § 1, 8-25-09)  
18.49.110 - Revocation.

Issuance of three or more collective administrative or criminal notices of violation or citations within a twelve-month period from any combination of the fire marshal, building official, code enforcement, and/or the police department.

2.  The imposition of any disciplinary action or finding of violation by the department of alcoholic beverage control, if alcoholic beverages are sold for on-site consumption. 
B.  The city of Whittier does not want to discourage business owners or others from contacting the police department or any other emergency service provider when warranted. Therefore, the number of emergency calls for service to the Whittier Police Department may not necessarily be used as the singular basis for concluding that a business is operating as a nuisance. 
C.  The approval authority may revoke a conditional use permit following the procedures set forth in Section 18.52.160, based on any one or more of the following findings: 
1.  That the conditional use permit was approved based on information that was erroneous, fraudulent, misleading or misrepresented, regardless of the intent of the entity that obtained the conditional use permit;

The owner of property who has received a permit to repair or reconstruct a damaged building, or his authorized agent, may file an application for extension of the time to commence construction under a validly issued building permit, or to complete construction beyond the time permitted by this section. The planning commission may extend the time by approval of an application for extension of reconstruction time in accordance with this chapter if the owner demonstrates reasonable need:

To receive such extension consideration, the property owner shall request an extension in writing on forms prepared for that purpose, no later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the time period sought to be extended as set forth in this chapter, including a full explanation of the reason why the extension should be granted. 
2.  Applications for extension of reconstruction time shall be filed with the secretary of the planning commission. The secretary of the planning commission, upon receipt of a timely application, including the fee as set by resolution of the city council, shall set the matter for hearing before the planning commission and shall cause notice of the time and place of the hearing upon same to be given and shall cause a hearing on such application to be held as specified in Section 18.62.140 of this chapter. Any decision of the planning commission under this section may be appealed to the city council within ten days of issuance of the written notice specified in Section 18.62.140. In the absence of a timely filing of an appeal of the decision of the planning commission to the city council, the decision of the planning commission shall be final and conclusive as of the date of the adoption of the resolution granting or denying an extension. Any appeal to the city council shall be heard and decided as set forth in Section 18.62.140. 
3.  The hearing body may grant an extension of time for reconstruction of a damaged building only upon making all of the required findings based upon the evidence presented at the hearing. The applicant shall have the burden of proof to show, by relevant evidence, the existence of facts supporting the conclusion that the findings as set forth below can be made: 
a.  Granting an extension of time for reconstruction is necessary as a result of delays beyond the control of the owner of the property and the owner has acted in good faith and with due diligence; 
b.  Granting an extension of time for reconstruction is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship to the owner(s) of the property; and 
c.  Granting an extension of time for reconstruction will not unreasonably interfere with the use, possession or enjoyment of surrounding properties. 
C.  Destroyed Structures. If a primary structure on any site is destroyed, any nonconforming use, structure and/or site shall be considered to be abated and any replacement development shall comply with the use, development, and design standards applicable to the zoning classification of the lot or parcel of land at the time application for development review approval pursuant to Chapter 18.56 of this title is filed. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.070 - Abatement. 
A.  Uses. Nonconforming uses shall be abated and shall not be reestablished, when any of the circumstances listed below are found to apply: 
1.  Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has been abandoned. 
2.  Elimination. When the structure that housed a nonconforming use has been destroyed. 
3.  Change in Use. 
a.  A change from a nonconforming use to a conforming use. 
b.  A change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use. However, such change may be permitted only after approval by the planning commission, supported by its findings that the new use is reasonably similar to or less intensive than the previous use and compatible with adjacent uses. Any new nonconforming use permitted by the planning commission shall continue only for the unexpired portion of the abatement period remaining for the original nonconforming use under this title. No change from one nonconforming use to another shall be permitted after the abatement period for the original nonconforming use has expired. 
4.  Expiration of abatement period. Nonconforming uses shall be abated and terminated upon the expiration of the periods of time set forth below. The periods of time shall be as follows, and shall commence to run as of the effective date of the ordinance that resulted in such use first becoming nonconforming: 
a.  A nonconforming nonstructural accessory use, including but not limited to areas used for keeping of animals, vehicular off-street parking facilities, or outside storage: one year. 
b.  A nonconforming use of a structure or site, except single family residential use of buildings intended for residential use: twenty years. 
c.  A nonconforming use of a nonconforming structure or site shall comply with the shortest abatement period established by this chapter for such use, structure or site. 
B.  Structures. Nonconforming structures shall be abated by demolition, removal, relocation, or alteration of the structure to bring it into conformity with all provisions of this title on or before the expiration of the periods of time set forth below. The periods of time shall be as follows, and shall commence to run as of the effective date of the ordinance which resulted in such structure first becoming nonconforming: 
1.  Abandoned nonconforming structures: immediately. 
2.  Nonconforming structures requiring no city building permit, including but not limited to, fences and walls: three years. 
3.  Properties improved only with a nonconforming structure that is accessory to a nonexistent principal structure where no development application for the property has been approved or is pending approval since the time at which the property became nonconforming: one year. 
4.  Nonconforming structures in R-zones designed for, and occupied with, a commercial use: five years. 
5.  Nonconforming structures in commercial and manufacturing zones twenty-five years. 
C.  Sites. A nonconforming site shall be abated by the alteration of the site to bring it into compliance with the development standards and design guidelines of this title, to the greatest extent possible, including but not limited to the requirements for architectural treatments, setbacks, landscaping and irrigation systems, temporary refuse storage areas, parking lot surfacing and striping, outside storage, and signs. Abatement shall be required any time that: 
1.  A nonconforming site is abandoned. 
2.  A nonconforming site is enlarged or altered in such a way as to occupy any part of any structure(s) on the site, or the site itself, which it did not occupy on the effective date of any ordinance codified in this title, or amendment thereto, which caused the site's nonconformance. 
3.  Any structure located on a nonconforming site is moved, removed, enlarged, or significantly altered. 
4.  The primary structure on a nonconforming site is destroyed. 
5.  The use of a nonconforming site is changed in such a way as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards set forth in this title.

(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.080 - AbatementOrder. 
When the city finds any of the facts set forth in Section 18.62.070 to exist, or where it is found that the abatement period as to a use, structure or site as set forth in this chapter has expired, a written order of abatement (hereinafter "order") shall be issued and notice given to the owners and persons in possession thereof. Unless the nonconformity has been previously abated, the owner and/or person in possession of the property to which the abatement order relates shall comply within the time and in the manner stated in such order. The provisions of the Whittier Municipal Code relating to public nuisance abatement and/or any other legal method or procedure may be utilized to obtain compliance, where deemed necessary by the city manager. An abatement order may be appealed to the city manager as provided in Section 18.62.140 of this chapter. Any such appeal must be in writing and made within ten days of the date of the abatement order. The city manager's decision on such an appeal shall be final and conclusive.  
18.62.090 - AbatementExtension. 
The purpose of an extension of the abatement period shall be to provide a reasonable opportunity to amortize the property owners investment in cases of economic hardship while making every effort to insure that the use, structure or site for which the application is submitted, is or will be rendered compatible with other existing and permitted neighboring uses as soon as feasible. The application for extension of abatement provides a process for the city to review the applicant's statement relating to alleged economic hardship arising from abatement of a nonconforming use, structure, or site, the nonconformity's impact on the community and consistency with current city goals and policies, and to provide an opportunity for the owner of such a property to address his plans for the property and the reasons why amortization of the investment involved could not be accomplished in the amortization period provided in this title. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.100 - AbatementExtension application. 
The owner of property to which an order of abatement relates, or his authorized agent, may file an application for extension of the abatement period relating to an order to abate a nonconforming use, structure, or site. Such applications shall be filed and considered pursuant to the following procedures: 
A.  Extensions by Zoning Administrator. The zoning administrator may extend the original abatement period, upon the filing of an application for extension of abatement in accordance with this chapter demonstrating reasonable need, in the following circumstances: 
1.  If a development review application is pending on the property which is the subject of an abatement order; and 
2.  The maximum total extension period that may be granted by the zoning administrator shall be six months. 
B.  Extensions by planning commission. The planning commission may extend the original abatement period by approving an application for extension of abatement, filed by the applicant in accordance with this chapter, where the applicant demonstrates reasonable need for such extension as set forth in this chapter. 
1.  To receive such extension consideration, the property owner shall request an extension in writing on forms prepared for that purpose, no later than ten days prior to the expiration of the abatement period as set forth in this chapter, including a full explanation of the reason why the extension should be granted. 
2.  Applications for extension of abatement shall be filed with the secretary of the planning commission. The secretary of the planning commission, upon receipt of a timely application, including the fee as set by resolution of the city council, shall set the matter for hearing before the planning commission and shall cause notice of the time and place of the hearing upon same to be given and shall cause a hearing on such application to be held as specified in Section 18.62.140 of this chapter. Any decision of the planning commission under this section may be appealed to the city council within ten days of issuance of the written notice specified in Section 18.62.140. In the absence of a timely filing of an appeal of the decision of the planning commission to the city council, the decision of the planning commission shall be final and conclusive as of the date of the adoption of the resolution granting or denying extension. Any appeal to the city council shall be heard and decided as set forth in Section 18.62.140. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11(part), 2002)  
18.62.110 - AbatementExtension findings. 
The following shall constitute the findings for granting an application for extension of abatement. Except for extensions which may be granted by the zoning administrator as set forth in Section 18.62.100A, the hearing body may grant the extension only upon making all of the required findings based upon the evidence presented at the hearing. The applicant shall have the burden of proof to show, by relevant evidence, the existence of facts supporting the conclusion that the findings as set forth below can be made: 
A.  The property owner or applicant or both will suffer severe economic hardship unless an extension of time to abate the nonconformity is granted; 
B.  The severe economic hardship is not the result of actions undertaken voluntarily by the property owner or applicant; 
C.  The property owner and applicant have taken all reasonable and necessary steps to bring the property into conformity or mitigate the effects of its nonconformity within the abatement period permitted; and 
D.  It is not reasonably feasible to relocate the nonconformity, alter the nonconformity, and/or redesign the site layout to conform to current development standards within the abatement period provided by this chapter because of special circumstances applicable to the property involved, such as size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, which make the approval of the application for extension of abatement necessary in order to facilitate a reasonable use of the property involved; and/or. 
E.  As to nonconforming uses only, it is not reasonably feasible to relocate such nonconforming use. 
No extension of abatement may be granted by the hearing body if the property on which the nonconformity does not have access to streets which are adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity and quality of traffic generated by the use; or if the continuation of the nonconformity will unreasonably interfere with the use, possession, or enjoyment of surrounding and adjacent properties, or the harm caused by allowing extension of the abatement period outweighs any demonstrated hardship upon the property owner seeking an extension of the abatement period. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.120 - Abatement extension conditions. 
The granting of an application for extension of abatement may be conditioned. The purpose of any such conditions shall be to insure that the continued use of the nonconforming use, structure, or site will be in a manner consistent with the public peace, safety, general welfare and the provisions of this title. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.130 - Abatement extensionPeriod of validity. 
A.  An extension of abatement shall be effective for the period specified in the resolution approving the application for extension of abatement or, if no period is so specified, five years. No more than one extension of abatement may be granted, and no abatement period may be extended by more than five years. 
B.  At the end of the extension period established in the resolution approving the application or as provided above, the approval shall expire and shall no longer be of any force and effect and the nonconforming use, structure, or site shall be abated as originally ordered or as required in this chapter. 
C.  To remain valid, any and all conditions of approval of a resolution granting an extension of abatement shall be satisfied within six months of the date of approval. If the work required by any and all conditions of approval of an extension of abatement is not commenced and completed within said six month period, said approval shall expire and shall no longer be of any force and effect and the nonconforming use, structure, or site shall be abated as originally ordered and/or as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.140 - Appeal procedure. 
A.  Where an appeal is permitted in this chapter, such appeal shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this section. 
B.  An appeal must be submitted in writing within the time prescribed in the Section permitting an appeal. If not appealed within the prescribed time period, then the determination, decision or order shall be deemed final and conclusive. 
C.  Unless other hearing procedures are specifically provided elsewhere in this chapter, the city manager, which shall include his/her designee throughout this section, shall schedule a hearing to be held within fifteen days after the filing of the appeal. Notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least ten days prior thereto, to the person appealing and the property owner(s).

18.62.150 - Exemptions. 
A.  Structures under construction. Any structure or site development may be completed and utilized notwithstanding the subsequent adoption of any regulations contained in this title or any amendment thereof which would have the effect of rendering the use, structure or site nonconforming ("subsequent regulation"), provided that: 
1.  A valid building permit has been issued or a structure for which no building permit is required is under construction prior to the operative date of any subsequent regulation, and 
2.  Construction is timely commenced and completed in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which any such building permit was issued.

The provisions of this title concerning the required abatement of nonconforming uses, structures and sites, and the reconstruction of nonconforming structures damaged or destroyed, shall not apply to public utility structures when such pertain directly to the rendering of the service of a utility, such as, but not limited to, electric distribution and transmission substations, communications equipment buildings, reservoirs, water wells and pumps, natural gas storage and metering and valve control stations; nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed or applied so as to prevent the expansion, modernization or replacement of such public utility structures, equipment and features as are used directly for the delivery of or distribution of the service, provided that this section shall not exempt such uses from the provisions of this chapter covering nonconformity of such structures or uses not immediately related to the direct service to consumers, including, but not limited to, warehouses, storage yards, vehicle maintenance facilities, and abandoned structures. 
C.  Public Acquisition. Whenever the area of a lot is reduced below the applicable minimum, or a structure or site would otherwise be rendered nonconforming within the meaning of this title solely because of dedication to, or purchase by, a public agency for any public purpose; or acquisition in eminent domain proceedings, such structure or site shall not be considered to be nonconforming, provided that, if subsequent to such acquisition, the structures located upon such lot are destroyed, determined as of the time applications for permits for such reconstruction or rehabilitation are filed, no reconstruction or rehabilitation shall take place unless compliance is had with all of the provisions of this title and Title 15 of the Whittier Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 2806 § 11 (part), 2002)  
18.62.160 - Cost estimate. 
Estimated costs required to be determined pursuant to this chapter shall be made by the building official within thirty days of application for development review or building permits for the affected property, in the same manner as building permit valuations are established.

Chapter 18.66 - DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM 
 
18.66.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes procedures to implement the state's Density Bonus Law as set forth in Government Code Section 65915. The incentives in this chapter are used by the city as a means of meeting its commitment to encouraging the provision of affordable housing to all economic groups living within the City.

18.66.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
"Concessions or other incentives" means a reduction in a site development standard or the modification of a zoning code requirement that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reduction; or, approval of nonresidential land uses in conjunction with the housing project if such other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located; or other concession or regulatory incentive that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reduction, as determined by the city in its sole discretion. A concession or other incentive does not include additional density beyond that allowed in this chapter. 
"Density bonus" means an increase in density above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under this title and the land use element of the general plan as of the date the development application for the project is deemed complete. 
"Development standard" means any site or construction condition that applies to a residential development pursuant to any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, charter amendment, or other local condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation. A development standard subject to waiver under this chapter does not include additional density beyond that allowed in this chapter. 
"Director" means the director of the city of Whittier department of community development or his or her designee. 
"Low-income households" means "lower income households" as that term is defined by Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code.

The provisions of this chapter apply only to multifamily residential and mixed-use development projects consisting of five or more dwelling units, not including the units granted as a density bonus. 
(Ord. 2911 § 1 (part), 2008)  
18.66.040 - Density bonus allowance. 
The amount of the density bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable dwelling units meets the percentage established in the following section. When calculating the number of density bonus units allowed, any fraction of a residential unit shall be counted as a whole unit. An applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus units. An applicant may not seek a density bonus greater than that provided in this chapter or by state law. 
A.  Density Bonus Requirement. Upon request and application of a developer, the city shall grant a density bonus in accordance with this section if the applicant seeks and agrees to construct one of the following: 
1.  At least five percent of the units are dedicated to very low-income households; 
2.  At least ten percent of the units are dedicated to low-income and very low-income households; 
3.  At least ten percent of the units are dedicated to moderate-income households and are available to the general public for sale; or 
4.  A senior citizen housing development as defined by Section 51.3 of the Civil Code. 
B.  Inclusionary units required by Section 18.11.040 and alternatives to inclusionary units allowed by Section 18.11.050 shall not count toward the minimum number of affordable units required by Section 18.66.050(A) to qualify for a concession or other incentive under.

Chapter 18.78 - NONCONFORMING AND ILLEGAL SIGNS 
Sections: 
 
18.78.001 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to provide procedures for the eventual removal of existing signs: (1) not in conformity with the newly established regulations of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76, and (2) rendered nonconforming by prior versions and amendments to provisions regulating the placement of commercial signs within the city. Removal of nonconforming signs is equally important to the goal of improving the aesthetic value of the community areas as is the regulation of new signs. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.010 - Definitions. 
The following shall have the meanings set forth in this section: 
A.  "Abandoned sign" means a sign remaining in place or not maintained for a period of ninety days, whose use has ceased, or which no longer advertises or identifies an ongoing business, product, or service available on the business premises where the sign is located. 
B.  "Amortization period" means fifteen years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter that resulted in a sign first becoming nonconforming. 
C.  "Appellant" means the person who files any appeal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  "Commission" means the planning commission. 
E.  "Council" means the city council. 
F.  "Director" means the director of community development for the city of Whittier. "Director" shall also include his or her designee. 
G.  "Fair and just compensation" means: 
1.  Fair and just compensation consists of the fair market value of an on-premises sign that has been designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more, at the time that the city requires its removal. The fair market value of a sign is determined according to Section 5492 or 5493 of the California Business & Professions Code. 
2.  Compensation is calculated as of the date the sign is removed. 
H.  "Illegal sign" means any sign erected without first complying with all ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of its construction and erection or use. 
I.  "Nonconforming" means a sign that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and which conforms with a building permit, conditional use permit, or sign plan review approval issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but does not conform to all the applicable regulations in Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
J.  "Notice" means where notice is required under this chapter, other than notice of a hearing decision, the date of the giving of such notice shall be the date of personal service thereof, or the date of its deposit in the course of transmission in the United States Postal Service. 
K.  "Order" means an order of abatement, issued by the director. 
L.  "Owner" means: (i) the person who is the record owner of the fee interest in the property to which an order relates, as shown on the latest assessor's roll, or as shown in a title report issued by a qualified title company; (ii) any person who is entitled to possession of such property; (iii) any person who is legally responsible for the business to which an order relates; or (iv) any person who is legally responsible for the sign to which an order relates. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.020 - ApplicabilityExceptionPurpose. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter apply exclusively to the abatement of all signs rendered nonconforming by reason of the application of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
B.  Exception. Exemption from the amortization provisions in this chapter exists if application of these provisions would unconstitutionally interfere with the investment backed expectations of the business to which the sign relates. 
C.  Burden of Proof. Sign owners must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the exception applies. "Clear and convincing evidence" means evidence of such convincing force that it demonstrates, in contrast to the opposing evidence, a high probability of the truth of the fact(s) for which it is offered as proof. The sign owner seeking the exception must also show, by clear and convincing evidence, the actual useful life of the sign at the end of which period the sign will be removed or brought into compliance with all the applicable provisions of this code. 
D.  Procedure. Sign owners seeking an exception under this section must file an application with the zoning administrator for a minor variance at least ninety days prior to the termination of the amortization period of fifteen years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, according to the procedures articulated in Chapter 18.58 (Zoning Administrator) of this code. 
E.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide sign owners with a procedure to seek an exception only where unique circumstances exist, which make the application of this chapter unreasonable. An application should only be submitted when a sign owner has sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exception applies. 
F.  Effect of Exception. Any exception will apply to a particular sign until the expiration of the period shown, by clear and convincing evidence, to be the useful life of the sign beyond the amortization period set forth in this chapter. When that additional period expires, the sign must be removed or brought into compliance with all applicable codes. No further exception as to that sign shall be granted. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.030 - New signs on lots with existing nonconforming signs. 
Where any sign located upon any lot in the city rendered nonconforming by reason of the application of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter, the following regulations apply to the construction and installation of any new sign upon such lot. 
A.  Residential Zones. No new sign shall be installed on any lot classified in zones R-E, R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4, if any nonconforming sign is located upon such lot. 
B.  Accessory Signs in C and M Zones. Notwithstanding the existence of a nonconforming sign on any lot classified in the C or M zones, new accessory signs may be located upon any such lot, provided that such accessory signs comply, in all respects, with the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
C.  Main Signs in C-O and C-1 Zone. Where a nonconforming main sign is located upon any C-O- or C-1-zoned lot, the following regulations shall apply to the construction and placement of any new main sign thereon: 
1.  Freestanding Signs. If a nonconforming freestanding sign is located upon such lot, no new freestanding sign is permitted there. If any other nonconforming sign exists, but no freestanding sign, one freestanding sign may be permitted, provided it complies with the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter, including but not limited to, Section 18.76.060. 
2.  Wall Signs. New wall signs may be permitted upon a C-1-zoned lot where nonconforming main signs exist; provided, that such new wall signs conform to the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
D.  Main Signs in Zones C-2, C-3, and M. On lots in the C-2, C-3, or M zones with existing nonconforming main signs, the following regulations govern the location of new main signs upon such lots: 
1.  Freestanding Signs. New freestanding signs may be erected if the total background sign area of all existing freestanding and proposed freestanding signs does not exceed the maximum allowable background sign area, as set forth in Section 18.76.060(A), and the new freestanding sign complies with the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
2.  Wall Signs. New wall signs may be placed on any such lot if the total background sign area of all existing and proposed signs does not exceed the maximum allowable background sign area, as set forth in Section 18.76.020(B), and the new wall sign otherwise complies with the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76. 
3.  Projecting Signs. New projecting signs may be erected if: 
a.  No roof sign exists above the same building proposed for the projecting sign; and 
b.  The background sign area and the location and height of the proposed new projecting sign comply with the provisions of Section 18.76.030(C); and 
c.  The total number of projecting signs existing and proposed will not exceed the maximum number permitted pursuant to Section 18.76.030(A). 
E.  Window Signs. No new window signs are permitted in any building in a C-O-zoned, C-1-zoned, C-2-zoned, C-3-zoned or M-zoned lot unless the aggregate sign background area of the proposed window sign, in addition to all other window signs in the building, equals twenty-five percent or less of the gross area of the window where located. 
F.  No person may erect or install any sign on any lot after the use to which it relates has been removed, discontinued, or abandoned. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.040 - Amortization period and procedures. 
A.  All permanent on-premises signs that have been designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more, and which are rendered nonconforming by the enactment of these provisions, must be rendered conforming or be removed entirely within fifteen years of the effective date of these provisions. 
B.  In the event that the director, upon notice, requires abatement of a nonconforming sign designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more prior to the expiration of the amortization period, the director must provide the owner with fair and just compensation for the value of the sign. 
C.  Upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the amortization period for all signs rendered nonconforming by the enactment of this chapter begins to run. Publication of this chapter constitutes notice of the start of the amortization period. The director may, at his or her sole discretion, provide additional written notice of the above to individual owners of on-premises signs. Under no circumstances does the failure by the director to provide written notice to individual advertising display owners extend the amortization period in any way whatsoever. 
D.  Any on-premises sign permit and/or conditional use permit issued by the director, or by any other official or department, at any time prior, or subsequent, to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter does not extend the amortization period in any way whatsoever. 
E.  Owners of existing on-premises signs may request a determination of nonconforming status from the planning division. Such determinations must be requested within three months of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Each request must contain the same information required for a permit application, as outlined in Sections 18.75.010 and 18.75.020. The planning division must make its determination within thirty days of receipt of the completed request. 
F.  A determination of nonconforming status may be appealed following the procedures outlined in Sections 18.78.120 through 18.78.160, below. Such an appeal must be filed within sixty days of the planning division's notice of determination. Failure to timely request a determination of nonconforming status or to timely appeal such a determination conclusively waives these rights. 
G.  Neither the request for determination of nonconforming status, nor the appellate process that may result therefrom, extends or tolls the amortization period in any way whatsoever. 
H.  Owners of on-premises signs are responsible to ensure that all nonconforming signs are entirely removed or rendered conforming by the date the amortization period expires. Every day thereafter that a nonconforming sign continues to be displayed may make the owner of the sign subject to administrative citation, the amount of which shall be determined by the director, based upon the size of the sign, but in no event to exceed five hundred dollars per day. Administrative citation fees may be applied retroactively to the first day following the expiration of the amortization period. 
I.  In the event the nonconforming sign is not removed or rendered conforming by the expiration of the amortization period, upon notice the director has the authority to remove, or to require the removal of, the sign within seven days of such notice. The owner of the sign is responsible for the cost of removal, as well as for any administrative citations incurred after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.050 - Removal without compensation. 
A.  The director, at his or her sole discretion and upon notice, may require the removal, without compensation, of any sign, as follows: 
1.  An illegal sign, as defined in Section 18.78.010(G). 
2.  All permanent on-premises signs that the director finds have not been designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more must be rendered conforming or be removed entirely upon notice by the city or within one year of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whichever comes first. 
3.  A sign which was lawfully erected anywhere within the territorial boundaries of the city but whose use has ceased, or the structure upon which the sign stands has been abandoned by its owner, for a period of not less than ninety days. 
4.  Any sign which has been more than fifty percent destroyed, and the destruction is other than facial copy replacement, and the sign cannot be repaired within thirty days of the date of its destruction. 
5.  Any sign whose owner, outside of a change of copy, requests permission to remodel and remodels that advertising display, or expands or enlarges the building or land use upon which the advertising display is located, and the display is affected by the construction, enlargement, or remodeling, or the cost of construction, enlargement, or remodeling of the advertising display exceeds fifty percent of the cost of reconstruction of the building. 
6.  Any sign whose owner seeks relocation thereof and relocates the sign. 
7.  Any sign for which there has been an agreement between the sign's owner and the director, for its removal as of any given date. 
8.  Any sign that is or may become a danger to the public or is unsafe. 
9.  Any sign that constitutes a traffic hazard not created by relocation of streets or highways or by acts of the city or the county. 
B.  The director, at his or her sole discretion and upon notice, may require the removal, without compensation, of any sign which meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  The sign is located within an area shown as residential or agricultural on a local general plan as of the date the display was lawfully erected. 
2.  The sign is located within an area zoned for residential or agricultural use on the date the display was lawfully erected. 
3.  The sign is not required to be removed because of an overlay zone, combining zone, special sign zone, or any other special zoning district whose primary purpose is the removal or control of signs. 
4.  The sign is allowed to remain in existence after March 12, 1983, for a period of fifteen years from the date of adoption of the ordinance or regulation. For purposes of this subsection only, every sign has a useful life of fifteen years. Fair and just compensation for signs required to be removed during the fifteen-year period and before the amortization period has lapsed shall be entitled to fair and just compensation which is equal to one-fifteenth of the duplication cost of construction of the display being removed multiplied by the number of years of useful life remaining for the sign as determined by this subsection. 
C.  Costs incurred in removing a sign pursuant to this section may be charged to the owner of the sign. 
(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.060 - Compliance with sign code as condition of permit approval. 
A.  Any existing legal nonconforming sign may be required to be brought into compliance with current applicable code requirements, or removed as a condition of approval of any redevelopment, building, conditional use, or other permit or approval required under any provision of the Whittier Municipal Code for the same property where the nonconforming sign is located, so long as a nexus exists between the permit or approval and the sign that must be removed or brought into compliance. 
B.  1.  No city department or division shall deny, refuse to issue, or condition the issuance of a business license or a permit to construct a new legal on-premises advertising display upon the removal, conformance, repair, modification, or abatement of any other on-premises advertising display on the same real property where the business is to be or has been maintained if both of the following apply: 
a.  The other display is located within the same commercial complex which is zoned for commercial occupancy or use, but at a different business location from that for which the permit or license is sought. 
b.  The other display is not owned or controlled by the permit applicant, and the permit applicant is not the agent of the person who owns or controls the other display. 
2.  The permit applicant shall receive fair and just compensation for any nonconforming sign that was designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more if the city requires such sign to be removed or upgraded as a condition of permit approval for any new sign on the property, when the amortization period for the legal nonconforming sign has not yet expired. 
C.  Except as provided for in subsection (B)(1) of this section, any existing legal nonconforming sign may be required to be removed or rendered compliant with current applicable code requirements, as a condition of approval of a permit for a new legal permanent on-premises sign or for modifications of an existing on-premises sign, at the discretion of the director or of the commission, as applicable.

(Ord. No. 2932, § 22, 8-11-09)  
18.78.080 - Repair and maintenanceConditions. 
A.  Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. The ordinary repair and maintenance of a nonconforming sign or sign structure is permitted; provided, that the cost thereof shall not exceed, in any consecutive twelve-month period, an aggregate total equal to twenty-five percent of the then replacement value of the sign structure, as estimated by the manager. 
B.  Eminent Domain. The repair, reconstruction, or remodeling of any sign or sign structure is not permitted where a part of such structure is taken for any public use by condemnation, dedication, or purchase by any agency having the power of eminent domain, unless such repair, reconstruction, or remodeling will result in such sign and/or sign structure complying with the provisions of Chapters 18.72 through 18.76 and this chapter. 
C.  Partial Destruction. Where any nonconforming sign is damaged or partially destroyed by any casualty, the same may be restored to the condition in which it existed immediately prior to the occurrence of such casualty.

(Ord. 2900 § 7 (part), 2007)  
18.78.100 - Abatement procedure. 
A.  Where the director finds that the amortization period has expired with respect to a nonconforming sign that has been designed, constructed, created, intended, or engineered to have a useful life of fifteen years or more, the director shall issue a written order of abatement, and give notice thereof. Alternatively, the director may issue an order at any time prior to the expiration of the amortization period for such a nonconforming sign, and the notice shall inform the owner that he or she is entitled fair and just compensation for the value of the sign. 
B.  Notice.

18.86.110 - Replacement building, structures, objects and landscape features. 
A.  No permit to demolish a building, structure, object or landscape feature that is a contributing resource within the Earlham historic district may be issued unless plans for a replacement to the building, structure, object or landscape feature to be demolished (in accordance with Section 18.84.420 (Replacement requirement) of the Whittier Municipal Code) has been reviewed and approved by the historic resources commission except if: 
1.  Demolition is determined to be necessary by the director of community development pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 18.89.100 (Unsafe or dangerous conditions) of this chapter, and/or; 
2.  The demolition is associated with a non-contributing resource within the historic district and/or has been previously evaluated and determined ineligible for individual designation on the City's Local Official Register of Historic Resources. 
B.  Any applicant requesting a demolition permit may apply to the historic resources commission to be exempted from this section. Exemption shall be permitted if the commission finds that a replacement building, structure, object or landscape feature for that being demolished or removed will not result in a significant adverse impact to the historic integrity and visual character of the Earlham historic district.

Chapter 18.87 - HADLEY/GREENLEAF HISTORIC DISTRICT 
 
18.87.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic integrity of the Historic District No. 1, also known as the Hadley/Greenleaf historic neighborhood, and to ensure that any new development or alterations to existing structures in the district are compatible with the historic fabric of the district. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.020 - Historic district defined. 
The following characteristics define Historic District No. 1: 
A.  Boundaries. The boundaries of the historic district are defined as follows: 
On the east: lots fronting onto Painter Avenue along the east side of the street, south to the north side of Hadley Street and north to the south side of Broadway, as illustrated in the accompanying map. 
On the west: the east side of Greenleaf Avenue, extending south to the north side of Hadley Street and extending north to the south side of Broadway. 
On the north: the south side of Broadway extending west to the east side of Greenleaf Avenue, and extending east to the properties fronting along the east side of Painter Avenue. 
On the south: the north side of Hadley Street extending west to the east side of Greenleaf Avenue, and extending east to those lots fronting the east side of Painter Avenue. 
B.  Historic Characteristics: The features of the Historic District No. 1 which define its historic significance and the character of the area to be preserved include: 
1.  Land Use. Historic District No. 1 is a residential neighborhood. Originally, the area was a single-family residential neighborhood, and many of the original single-family homes remain. Some have been converted to multifamily use, and some older homes have been replaced with new multifamily structures. However, the land use in the area is predominantly residential. 
2.  Architectural Styles. Historic District No. 1 includes examples of a variety of architectural styles, including Victorian cottages (see Exhibit 1), Spanish or Mediterranean revival (Exhibit 2) and modern structures. However, the predominant style is the craftsman bungalow (Exhibits 3 and 4). This style is characterized by buildings with gabled rather than flat roofs, extended eaves with exposed rafters, use of natural materials (wood, stone, brick) and an effort to tie the interior space to the environment through the inclusion of many windows, wide doors or French doors, porches and balconies, and extensive landscaping. 
3.  Scale. The scale of the structures which are over fifty years old is smaller than the more modern buildings. Buildings are generally two stories or less, and cover less than half of the lot on which they are located. There is a substantial amount of landscaped open space between structures. Exhibit 5 shows the scale of development on a typical street, and Exhibit 6 shows typical street landscaping. 
4.  Landscaping. The landscaping of both private property and public rights-of-way is extensive and mature. The impression is of a wooded area with buildings tucked into the landscaping. Landscaping plans are informal and imitate nature, as was common in the era when craftsman bungalows were constructed. Exhibit 7 is an example of the lush landscaping common in the area. 
5.  Public Improvements. Public improvements in the area include paved local streets with curbs, gutters and sidewalks separated from the street by a landscaped median. Each street has a mixture of street trees, rather than a single type. Older streetlight fixtures remain along Painter Avenue, but the rest of the area is served by lights attached to utility poles. Exhibit 8 illustrates the older streetlight style. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.030 - Permitted uses. 
Land uses permitted in the Historic District No. 1 shall be those permitted in the underlying zone, provided the construction or operation of such use is compatible with the requirements of this chapter. In addition to such principal permitted uses, accessory uses permitted by the underlying zone classification shall also be allowed. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.040 - Development standards. 
No plan for development, alteration, expansion or construction on properties located in the historic district shall be approved unless the same complies with the following development standards: 
A.  Site and Setting. If a property owner or a developer intends to utilize a historic resource as part of a development, he should consider the context of the resource's original site and the importance of the setting in the proposed development. 
1.  In some instances, a resource will occupy the full site and limit development opportunities to rehabilitation, renovation or restoration for adaptive reuse. 
2.  In instances where a resource occupies less than the full site, greater flexibility will be available for new development that incorporates the resource into the project, except that all new development, alteration or expansion of existing structures shall maintain the required lot coverage and setbacks of the underlying zone. 
B.  Building Height. All new development or alteration or expansion of existing structures shall comply with the height limits of the underlying zone. Height of all structures at street level should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. Use of setbacks at upper levels may be permitted to achieve maximum utilization of a property compatible with the appearance of the area. 
C.  Density and Intensity of Development. The maximum dwelling unit density or building intensity permitted in the historic district shall be that permitted by the underlying zone, so long as the resulting development is appropriate to the neighborhood. The apparent physical size, scale and height of all structures should relate to existing resources without overwhelming them. Exhibit 5 illustrates the range of height and scale existing in the area. 
D.  Off-Street Parking. The off-street parking requirements for all development in historic district shall be those established for the underlying zone. 
E.  Design Guidelines. In considering whether a proposed development is compatible with the historic character of Historic District No. 1, property owners, developers, city staff, historic resources commission and council members shall be guided by the following: 
1.  Proportion of Openings. The width and height of windows, doors and entries should be visually compatible with buildings, structures, public ways and places in the surrounding area. A long unbroken facade or small, widely-spaced windows is not appropriate. Wooden double-hung or casement windows are typical of the area, often placed in groups of two or more. Examples of the types of windows and doors and their placement in the facade can be seen in Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10. The relationship of solid spaces (i.e., walls) to voids (i.e., windows and doors) in the facade of a building or structure should be visually compatible with buildings, structures and public ways in the surrounding area. 
2.  Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings or Structures on the Street. The relationship of a building or structure to the open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures should respect the surrounding environment. The building mass of large architectural projects can be varied in form using setbacks for open space and landscaping when appropriate to provide necessary visual transitions between a lawn, new building and the adjacent historic resources. See Exhibits 5 and 6. 
3.  Porches and Entryways. The relationship of entrances and other projections to sidewalks should be designed with the street scene provided by existing buildings, structures and public ways as a guide to ensure that they are visually related. Examples of the types of porches and entries typical to the historic district are shown in Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 11 and 12. 
4.  Relationship of Materials, Texture and Color. The relationship of materials, texture and color of the facade of a building or structure should be chosen with the predominant materials used in existing buildings or structures in mind. Paint colors are exempt from review, however, colors of natural materials should be considered. The choice of exterior colors and material textures should be tempered by the predominant colors and textures of the surrounding area. In general, the use of manmade materials (metal, plastic) in facades should be limited because the majority of the historic structures in the historic district use natural materials, and specifically wood, brick or stone. Simplicity in the use of materials, textures and colors is preferable. Exhibits 13, 14 and 15 illustrate typical wood shingles and siding found on homes in the area. 
5.  Roof Shapes. The roof shape of a building is a major distinguishing visual element. In most cases, a simple roof form similar to that of the existing historic resources in the area should be used. Most homes in the area have pitched rather than flat roofs and the typical roofing material is composition shingle. Examples of rooflines typical of the area are shown in Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 17 and 18. Notice that the roofline is frequently broken by dormers. 
6.  Design of Accessory Structures. The proposed project should take into account the compatibility of landscaping, fences and walls, parking facilities, utility and service areas, walkways and other accessory structures. These should be designed with the overall environment in mind and should be in visual keeping with related buildings, structures and places. 
7.  Landscaping. All mature trees removed to make way for new construction or alteration of an existing structure should be replaced with large box size trees of a type typical to the area and similar in form to the tree removed. Landscaping should be similar in design and type of plants used to that which occurs typically in the area. Exhibits 6 and 7 illustrate typical planting configurations in the area. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.050 - Certificate of appropriateness required.

(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998) 
(Ord. No. 2932, § 22, 8-11-09)  
18.87.070 - Required findings. 
Before a certificate of appropriateness is approved, the body approving the certificate must make the following findings of fact: 
A.  The proposed project is consistent with the purposes of this chapter; and 
B.  Every reasonable effort has been made to adapt the project in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object or site and its relationship to its environment; and 
C.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object or site have been preserved as much as possible; or 
D.  The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed action is the only reasonable means to correct an unsafe or dangerous condition on the property; or 
E.  The applicant has demonstrated that denial of the application will result in immediate or substantial hardship. In determining whether immediate or substantial hardship exists, the commission shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  Whether denial of the application will severely diminish the economic value of the structure or property, 
2.  Whether denial of the application will prevent or make impractical reasonable beneficial use of the structure or property. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.080 - Expiration of certificate of appropriateness. 
A certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for a period of twelve months from the date of issuance. The certificate shall expire at the end of this period unless work has commenced in accordance with the approved plan. The director may extend the approval for no longer than two additional six-month periods. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.090 - Demolition and relocation of structures. 
A.  If the application proposes demolition or off-site relocation and the certificate is not issued pursuant to Section 18.87.070 of this chapter, the commission may require a forty-five-day review period for the purpose of providing time to explore alternatives to the removal of the structure, including compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Preservation. 
1.  No later than the end of the forty-five days, the commission shall review the progress made towards preservation. If additional time is needed to accomplish preservation of the structure, the commission may impose an additional stay on issuance of the certificate not to exceed a total of one hundred eighty days. The stay shall be terminated at any time the commission, or the city council on appeal, determines that preservation is not feasible. 
2.  No later than the end of the one-hundred-eighty-day stay, the commission shall again review the progress made towards preservation. If preservation has not been accomplished, and alternatives to demolition or removal have been thoroughly explored, the commission shall determine whether preservation is still feasible, and either: 
a.  Issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, provided plans for a replacement structure have been approved; or 
b.  Deny the certificate of appropriateness application. 
B.  Prior to issuance of the certificate of appropriateness for demolition or the removal of a structure within the district, the applicant shall provide to the director, at the applicant's sole cost, archival quality photo-documentation of the exterior of the structure to be demolished or removed. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.100 - Unsafe or dangerous conditions. 
None of the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to prevent or apply to any work or demolition necessary to correct or eliminate the unsafe or dangerous condition of any historic building or of any building or structure located in the district, where such conditions have caused the structure to be declared unsafe, dangerous pursuant to Chapters 8.08 and 15.04 of the Whittier Municipal Code. The historic resources commission shall be advised of the required demolition, prior to issuance of the demolition or building permit needed to alleviate the unsafe condition. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.110 - Replacement structures. 
A.  No permit to demolish a structure within the historic district boundaries may be issued unless plans for a replacement structure or a project have been reviewed and approved by the historic resources commission, unless: 
1.  Demolition is determined to be necessary in order to correct or eliminate a dangerous or unsafe condition posing a hazard to the general public. 
B.  An applicant for demolition permits may apply to the commission for relief from the requirements of this section. The commission may grant relief if it finds that demolition without replacement will not result in adverse impact to the district. Adverse impacts to the district may include, and shall be found if, the loss of the structure without replacement is likely to result in nuisance uses of the vacant property or would have an adverse visual impact on the neighborhood. 
(Ord. 2723 § 3 (part), 1998)  
18.87.120 - AppealsEffective date. 
The determination of the historic resources commission shall become effective and final thirty days after their final action, unless within such period of time an appeal, in writing, is filed with the city clerk-treasurer, by the applicant or any other interested person.

Chapter 18.88 - CENTRAL PARK HISTORIC DISTRICT 
Sections: 
 
18.88.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic integrity of the Central Park historic district, ensuring that any new development or alterations to existing structures in the district are compatible with the historic fabric of the district. 
(Ord. 2705 § 2 (part), 1997)  
18.88.020 - Historic district defined. 
The following characteristics define the Central Park historic district: 
A.  Boundaries. The boundaries of the historic district are defined on the accompanying map, and as follows: 
On the east: the public alley behind lots located on the east side of Friends Avenue, generally located between the centerline of Hadley Street to the north and Philadelphia Street to the south, to include the single lot located at the southwest corner of Painter Avenue and Bailey Street. 
On the west: the public alley directly behind lots located on the west side of Washington Avenue generally located between the centerline of Hadley Street to the north, and Philadelphia Street to the south, to include the single lot located on the southeast corner of Bright Avenue and Bailey Street. 
On the north: the centerline of Hadley Street between the Washington/Bright Avenue alley to the west, and the Friends/Painter Avenue alley to the east. 
On the south: portions of blocks south of Bailey Street between Painter and Bright Avenues, as illustrated on the accompanying map. 
B.  Historic Characteristics. The features of the Central Park historic district which define its historic significance and the character of the area to be preserved include: 
1.  Land Use. The Central Park historic district is primarily a residential neighborhood on the periphery of the Uptown commercial center. Originally, the residential neighborhood contained single-family uses, and some of the original single-family homes remain. Other properties in the area have been converted to multifamily use, with some minor replacement development of apartment structures. Also located within the district is the former Women's Club building, now housing the Rio Hondo Chapter of the Red Cross. This structure, as well as the Post Office, serve as a transition into the Uptown Whittier commercial core. Central Park itself is located within the middle of the district, serving as an Uptown Whittier focal point and special event locale. 
2.  Architectural Styles. The Central Park historic district includes examples of a variety of architectural styles, including Victorian, Spanish or Mediterranean revival, and Craftsman structures. The compilation of Victorian houses in the Central Park area may arguably be the largest and most unique collection remaining in Whittier. The Victorian houses are generally two-story structures with intricate detailing including elaborate columns, extensive porch areas, varying wood shingle finishes, and steeply pitched roofs. Some structures appear to contain features from both the Victorian and Craftsman eras, most likely serving as transition buildings. 
3.  Scale. The general scale of the residential structures is fairly uniform with many of the residences surrounding the park constructed with two stories. Many of the lots maintain multifamily uses with two units (front and rear) located on the lot. The lots with single units generally cover less than half of the lot on which they are located. The open space between structures illustrates substandard setbacks typical of historic tracts, however, the distance between structures is adequate and with appropriate open areas provided for in the front lawns and backyards. 
4.  Landscaping. Central Park serves as a neighborhood green space with many references to the past. The park also serves as a major contributor to the unique character of the area. Additionally, the landscaping of both private property and public rights-of-way is extensive and mature. The impression of an original town center is very evident in the layout, street systems, and orientation of the structures surrounding the park. A large stand of palm trees, along Washington Avenue, contributes to the overall quality and maturity of the area. The preservation of these trees will continue to present the appropriate authenticity to the area. 
5.  Public Improvements. Public improvements in the area include paved local streets with curbs, gutters and sidewalks separated from the street by a landscaped median. The public right-of way includes street trees of varying type and maturity. Central Park is a public park that is maintained by the city. 
(Ord. 2705 § 2 (part), 1997)  
18.88.030 - Permitted uses. 
Land uses permitted in the Central park historic district shall be those permitted in the underlying zone; provided, the construction or operation of such use is compatible with the requirements of this chapter. In addition to such principal permitted uses, accessory uses permitted by the underlying zone classification shall also be allowed. 
(Ord. 2705 § 2 (part), 1997)  
18.88.040 - Development standards. 
No plan for development, alteration, expansion or construction on properties located in the Central Park historic district shall be approved unless the same complies with Section 18.87.040 of the zoning regulations and Chapter 5 of the Uptown Whittier Specific Plan, as amended. 
(Ord. 2705 § 2 (part), 1997)  
18.88.050 - Certificate of appropriateness required.

1.  Demolition is determined to be necessary in order to correct or eliminate a dangerous or unsafe condition posing a hazard to the general public. 
B.  An applicant for demolition permits may apply to the commission for relief from the requirements of this section. The commission may grant relief if it finds that demolition without replacement will not result in adverse impact to the district. Adverse impacts to the district may include, and shall be found if, the loss of the structure without replacement is likely to result in nuisance uses of the vacant property or would have an adverse visual impact on the neighborhood. 
(Ord. 2705 § 2 (part), 1997)  
18.88.120 - AppealsEffective date. 
The determination of the historic resources commission shall become effective and final thirty days after their final action, unless within such period of time an appeal, in writing, is filed with the city clerk-treasurer, by the applicant or any other interested person.

Chapter 18.89 - COLLEGE HILLS HISTORIC DISTRICT 
 
18.89.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic integrity of the College Hills historic district, ensuring that any new development or alterations to existing structures in the district are compatible with the historic context and identity of the district. 
(Ord. No. 2926, § 1, 5-26-09)  
18.89.020 - Historic district defined. 
The following characteristics define the College Hills historic district: 
A.  Boundaries. The College Hills historic district boundaries are based on the original College Hills Subdivision Map of 1923, which is comprised of a thirty-one-acre site that has been subdivided into a total of one hundred nineteen (119) lots along Philadelphia Street, Ridge Road, Bryn Mawr Way, Hillside Lane, and Worsham Drive, as shown on the map below. Each lot within the College Hills historic district has been identified as a contributing resource, non-contributing resource or vacant lot. 
  
	Contributing Resource* 
	Non-Contributing Resource 
	Vacant 
 
*In addition to the residences located on the lots noted above, the following features are also contributing resources to the College Hills historic district: 
1.  Original street lamps located on Bryn Mawr Way, Glen Court, Hillside Lane, Philadelphia Street, and Worsham Drive. 
2.  Canary Island Pine Trees (Pinus Canariensis) planted along Bryn Mawr Way and Philadelphia Street. 
3.  Cement step walkway linking Worsham Drive, Hillside Lane, Philadelphia Street, and Ridge Road. 
4.  Retaining walls on said properties located on Bryn Mawr Way, Glen Court, Hillside Lane, Philadelphia Street, and Worsham Drive. 
B.  Historic Characteristics. The features of the College Hills historic district which define its historic significance and the character of the area to be preserved include: 
1.  Land Use. Originally a part of Worsham Ranch, the College Hills residential subdivision, now referred to as the College Hills historic district, was created in 1923 by a syndicate of Whittier businessmen who later sold their interest in the subdivision to Whittier College. 
The majority of homes within the College Hills historic district were generally developed over a period of six decades (circa 1920's to 1970's). Many of the properties have panoramic views of the city and of the greater southern California region. 
Developing a reputation as one of the finest residential subdivisions in the city, the College Hills subdivision became synonymous with many college, government, community, and business leaders in Southern California who owned property in the neighborhood. It also appealed to many well-to-do members of the community. 
As the subdivision has been successfully developed to master the steep slopes, grade changes, and curving hills throughout development, it represents not only an excellent example of an early, large scale, 20 th Century hillside subdivision, but the earliest of its type within the city of Whittier. Likewise, the site design and engineering solutions used for the construction of many of these hillside homes are unique to College Hills due to the topography of the subdivision. 
College Hills is also particularly representative of a cohesive subdivision in that over ninety-nine percent of the original 1923 lot lines within the tract have remained unchanged. The development also showcases the architectural evolution of homes that have occurred within the city, since 1923. Many of these homes reflect high quality architectural designs and craftsmanship that have been preserved since their construction resulting in the historic integrity of these structures and the lots they were developed on remaining intact. 
2.  Architectural Styles. Overall, the homes within the College Hills historic district have maintained their original architectural style, as originally built. Hence, the majority of homes serve as excellent, intact, examples of various architectural styles that have evolved since the 1920's. Many of the architectural styles found within the College Hills historic district include: Spanish Colonial Revival, Colonial Revival, Mission Revival, Tudor, Provincial Revival, and California Ranch. 
3.  Contributing Resources. A contributing resource refers to any structure, object improvement or landscape that adds to the historical, architectural, or cultural significance of a historic district and is consistent with the historic context of that district. A list of contributing resources/properties within the College Hills historic district shall be identified and maintained within the City's Local Official Register of Historic Resources. 
4.  Non-Contributing Resources. A non-contributing resource refers to any structure, object, improvement or landscape that does not add to the historical, architectural or cultural significance of a historic district and is inconsistent with the historic context of that district. 
(Ord. No. 2926, § 1, 5-26-09)  
18.89.030 - Permitted uses. 
Land uses permitted in the College Hills historic district shall be those permitted in the underlying zone; provided, the construction or operation of such use is compatible with the requirements of this chapter. In addition to such principal permitted uses, accessory uses permitted by the underlying zoning classification shall also be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 2926, § 1, 5-26-09)  
18.89.040 - Development standards.

(Ord. 2421 § 1 (part), 1987)  
Division VI. - Community Design  
Chapter 18.92 - SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES 
 
18.92.010 - Design goals. 
Single-family residential development dominates the urban form of the city. The design and configuration of lots and uses reflect various planning styles used at the time of development, such as the early town grid lots, later large subdivisions, curvilinear hillside development and planned unit developments. This diversity of housing types designed in different periods is characteristic of this community. The guidelines apply to smaller infill as well as larger master planned projects and encourage the highest level of design quality while allowing maximum flexibility in the design of single-family residential development that will: 
A.  Create livable neighborhoods and residential areas as well as safe and attractive streets by encouraging high-quality architecture, landscape and design; and 
B.  Emphasize design compatibility within existing neighborhoods, both in site planning and architectural design. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.92.020 - Design objectives. 
The design of single-family residential development projects in the city should: 
A.  Respect the scale, proportion and character of the surrounding area; 
B.  Provide pedestrian-friendly design solutions to adverse traffic patterns; 
C.  Establish attractive, inviting, imaginative and functional site design; 
D.  Create visual interest and variety; 
E.  Maintain a sense of harmony and proportion along street frontages and other portions of the project exposed to public view; 
F.  Preserve and incorporate natural amenities unique to the site such as hillside views, topography, and mature trees; and 
G.  Preserve and incorporate historically, culturally, or architecturally significant building into the project development proposal. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.92.030 - Site design guidelines. 
A.  Grading. Grading should be minimized where possible to preserve the natural character of the land. When grading is unavoidable, incorporate the following guidelines: 
1.  Follow the natural contours as much as possible. 
2.  Slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing terrain. 
3.  Emphasize and accentuate scenic vistas. 
4.  Avoid large manufactured slopes in favor of several smaller slopes. 
5.  Retain and incorporate significant natural vegetation into the project. 
6.  Implement slope-stabilizing landscaping and irrigation on manufactured slopes. 
B.  Compatibility. New homes should be built in scale with the existing neighborhood. Therefore, in addition to the minimum code requirements for yards, height, lot coverage and floor area; the predominant setback, yards, size and height of the existing neighborhood should be considered in determining the overall size and situation of the house. 
1.  The arrangement of structures, circulation and open spaces should recognize the particular characteristics of the site. 
2.  Project design should relate to the surrounding built environment in pattern, function, scale, character and materials. 
3.  Infill structures and new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality which have been set by surrounding development. 
4.  Structures that are distinctive due to their age, cultural significance or unique architectural style should be preserved and incorporated in the project proposal. 
5.  Residential units should be buffered from incompatible development through increased setbacks, intensified landscaping and appropriate building orientation. 
C.  Building siting. 
1.  Primary building: 
a.  Front primary buildings to the street; 
b.  Front infill buildings in the same direction as the surrounding development; 
c.  Vary setbacks of homes and garages. 
2.  Garage. The garage and driveway location is the most significant factor in determining the overall site layout for small- to medium-size lots. The configuration that best reflects the existing neighborhood pattern should be selected. 
a.  Detached Garage. The garage is a separate structure from the house, usually located at the rear of the property, with alley or street access. Alley access is required where available. 
b.  Attached GarageRear. Garage is attached to the rear of the house, with side or rear access from the street or alley. Alley access is required where available. 
c.  Attached GarageSide or Front. Garage is attached to the side or front of the house, with street access. Angled or side-entry garages should be used to break up the monotony of garage doors facing the street. 
  
d.  Interior Lots: 
i.  If the garage is attached to the front of the house, the garage door should be perpendicular to the front property line. 
ii.  If the garage door faces the street, it should be set back at least two feet from the front wall of the house. 
iii.  In no case should a front-facing garage constitute greater than sixty percent of the front façade. 
e.  Corner Lots: 
i.  If the garage is attached to the front of the house, the garage door should be perpendicular to the front of the house. 
ii.  If the garage is attached to the side of the house with the garage door parallel to the front wall of the house, the garage door should be set back at least two feet from the front wall of the house. 
iii.  In no case should a front-facing garage constitute greater than sixty percent of the front façade. 
f.  Design guidelines for attached and detached garages, as well as accessory structures, are found later in this document. 
D.  Setback.. 
The structure should be set back from the front property line either the distance required by the zoning code or the average of existing setbacks on the street, whichever is greater. 
  
E.  Walls and Fences. 
1.  Fences and walls should be built with attractive, durable materials, including, but not limited to, redwood, wrought iron, textured concrete block, or formed concrete with reveals. 
2.  Chainlink fencing, corrugated metal fencing and or fiberglass fencing and "tennis windscreens" are not permitted within the front yard or street side, side yard areas. 
3.  Fences or walls may not exceed a height of six feet within required yard areas and shall not exceed forty-two inches within the required front and street side, side yard areas, except as provided in this Title. 
4.  At the street, avoid long expanses of uninterrupted fences and walls, including those fences between the side of the house and the interior property line, which are visible from the street. Use an opening, planter box, material change, pilasters or posts, or a 3-foot stagger at least every twenty feet. When adjacent to the front corner of the house, set back fence or wall at least one foot behind house so that the wall or fence is not in line with front plane of house. 
5.  Provide an opening to fences and walls to connect walkways to the streetfor pedestrians. These pedestrian "gateways" should be announced by pilasters, special landscaping, or other special features. 
6.  A protective coating should be applied to all wood and iron fences. 
7.  Fences should be constructed to industry standard. 
F.  Drainage. 
Using various control techniques to limit off-site drainage helps to create a healthier watershed. There are many ways to capture water on-site and divert water underground. Residential development should integrate water runoff best management practices into the site design. For more information on National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (Clean Water Act) guidelines and best management practices consult the city public works department.

Chapter 18.94 - MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES 
 
18.94.010 - Design goals. 
Multi-family residential development appears in a variety of forms throughout the city. Although many of the design guidelines for single-family residential apply, multi-family projects offer a wide range of issues and opportunities unique to themselves. Multi-family developments, if not properly designed, can dominate their surrounding, increase neighborhood parking and circulation problems, and decrease common and private open space. The guidelines distinguish between small projects (two or three units), and large developments (four or more units), but present common goals that encourage the highest level of design quality while allowing maximum flexibility in the design of multi-family residential development that will: 
A.  Create livable neighborhoods and residential areas as well as safe and attractive streets by encouraging high-quality architecture, landscape, design and open space; and 
B.  Emphasize design compatibility within existing neighborhoods, both in site planning and architectural design. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.94.020 - Design objectives. 
The design of multi-family residential development projects in the city should: 
A.  Respect the scale, proportion and character of the surrounding area; 
B.  Provide pedestrian-friendly design solutions to adverse traffic patterns; 
C.  Establish attractive, inviting, imaginative and functional site design; 
D.  Provide adequate open space, parking and privacy; 
E.  Create visual interest and variety; 
F.  Maintain a sense of harmony and proportion along street frontages and other portions of the project exposed to public view; 
G.  Preserve and incorporate natural amenities unique to the site such as hillside views, topography, and mature trees; and 
H.  Preserve and incorporate historically, culturally, or architecturally significant building into the project development proposal. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.94.030 - Site design guidelines. 
A.  Grading. Grading should be minimized where possible to preserve the natural character of the land. When grading is unavoidable, incorporate the following guidelines: 
1.  Follow the natural contours as much as possible. 
2.  Slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing terrain. 
3.  Emphasize and accentuate scenic vistas. 
4.  Avoid large manufactured slopes in favor of several smaller slopes. 
5.  Retain and incorporate significant natural vegetation into the project. 
6.  When grading is unavoidable, minimize raising the grade significantly above the grade of adjacent properties, especially near interior property lines. When such grading is unavoidable, compensate by planning for reduced building heights within the raised grades. 
7.  Implement slope-stabilizing landscaping and irrigation on manufactured slopes. 
B.  Compatibility. New units should be built in scale with the existing neighborhood. Therefore, in addition to the minimum code requirements for yards, height, lot coverage and floor area; the predominant setback, yards, size and height of the existing neighborhood should be considered in determining the overall size and situation of the buildings. 
1.  The arrangement of structures, circulation and open spaces should recognize the particular characteristics of the site. 
2.  Project design should relate to the surrounding built environment in pattern, function, scale, character and materials. 
3.  Infill structures and new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality which have been set by surrounding development. 
4.  Structures that are distinctive due to their age, cultural significance, or unique architectural style should be preserved and incorporated in the project proposal. 
5.  Residential units should be buffered from incompatible development through increased setbacks, intensified landscaping, and appropriate building orientation. 
C.  Building Siting. 
1.  Primary Building. 
a.  Two or three Units. Multi-family development projects consisting of two to three units should be designed to appear single-family in character. Ways to achieve this at the site plan level include: 
i.  The front-most units should be oriented to face the street and incorporate single-family home features, including a prominent entry, a front porch of eight foot by ten foot minimum dimensions and a second floor setback of at least ten feet. 
ii.  The units should incorporate architectural features that help individually distinguish them, such as wall breaks, projections, distinct color schemes and individual roof treatments. 
iii.  Attached side-by-side units are permitted, if a single-family architectural appearance is maintained. 
iv.  For corner lots, units should front onto street side and front property lines. 
v.  Units should be staggered to avoid driveway corridor effect. 
vi.  Side-facing units should face the most distant side property line from the unit. 
b.  Four or More Units. Multi-family development projects consisting of four or more units should be designed to address the street, and to create pedestrian connections to adjacent, complementary uses as well as public sidewalks and facilities. The site plan should address the following guidelines: 
i.  Units should front onto, in order of consideration: public streets and sidewalks, common open spaces, and interior pedestrian paths. 
ii.  Buildings constructed on corner lots should incorporate a well-defined architectural focal element addressing the corner. The corner element should complement existing corner elements on other buildings adjacent to the intersection, in size, scale and composition, and should be proportionate in size to the street intersection it addresses. 
iii.  Units facing interior property lines should face the most distant interior property line from the unit. If this is not practical, the front wall of each unit should be set back at least ten feet from the interior property line, and screened from the view of adjacent properties by tall screening landscaping. 
iv.  If possible, the buildings should be situated to avoid driveway corridor effect to prevent the entire length of a driveway from direct view of the public. 
2.  Garage.

b.  Ground-level open space should be bounded only by garden walls, garage walls, and/or the walls of the unit the open space is intended to serve. 
c.  Ground-level open space should be located adjacent to required side and rear yards to maximize their useable area. 
d.  Above-ground open space (i.e. decks and balconies) should be set back at least ten feet from interior property lines. 
2.  Four or More Units. 
a.  Common open space should be enhanced with paths, plazas, gardens, benches, shade structures and water elements. These improvements should be consistent with the architectural style of the building. Common open spaces should be connected and coordinated with public landscape and hardscape improvements, where existing. 
b.  All private open space should be fenced for the private use of the occupants of the unit it is intended to serve. 
c.  Ground-level private open space should be bounded only by garden walls, garage walls and/or the walls of the unit the open space is intended to serve.

G.  Landscaping. 
1.  Two or Three Units. 
a.  Three twenty-four inch box size trees should be provided for each unit. The trees should be planted where they will provide significant shade for open space areas, including ground level open areas, porches and second-floor balconies; where they will shade units to reduce air conditioning demand in summer months; and where they will enhance privacy between units as well as protect the privacy of abutting lots. 
b.  Planting areas throughout the property should be enhanced with shrubs and flower beds. 
2.  Four or More Units. 
a.  One and a half twenty-four inch box size trees should be provided for each unit.

H.  Utilities. Transformers, post-indicator valves, backflow-preventers and similar apparatus shall either be undergrounded or located in inconspicuous areas, and screened with landscaping. 
I.  Walls and Fences. 
1.  The following guidelines are common to all multi-family residential development: 
a.  Fences and walls should be built with attractive, durable materials, including, but not limited to, redwood, wrought iron, textured concrete block or formed concrete with reveals. A protective coating should be applied to all wood and iron fences. All fences and walls should be constructed to industry standards.

c.  Fences or walls should be compatible with materials and designs used on the dwelling and accessory buildings. 
d.  Walls may not exceed a height of six feet within required yard areas, except as provided in this Title, and should not exceed forty-two inches within the required front and street yard areas. 
e.  At the street, avoid long expanses of uninterrupted fences and walls, including those fences between the side of the front unit and the interior property line, which are visible from the street. Use an opening, planter box, material change, pilasters or posts, or a three foot stagger at least every forty feet. When adjacent to the front corner of the front unit, set back fence or wall at least one foot behind the unit so that the wall or fence is not in line with front plane of the unit. 
f.  Walls, including columns, shall be finished with a trim cap. 
g.  Walls along interior property lines, within the front yard, should be stepped down at least two times and each step should be marked by a column, that is wider than the wall. 
2.  Provide an opening to fences and walls to connect walkways to the street. These pedestrian "gateways" should be announced by pilasters, special landscaping, or other special features. 
J.  Drainage. Using various control techniques to limit off-site drainage helps to create a healthier watershed. There are many ways to capture water on-site and divert water underground. Residential development should integrate water runoff best management practices into the site design. For more information on National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (Clean Water Act) guidelines and best management practices, consult the city public works department.

Commercial developments are located in many prominent locations throughout the city and convey a strong visual image. The attention paid to their design reflects a city's pride in itself and its economic vitality. For this reason, the commercial design guidelines are intended to promote high quality development that will: 
A.  Lead to quality architecture and design; 
B.  Contribute to a positive physical image and identity of the city; and 
C.  Complement and preserve the surrounding natural resources. 
Commercial development should also strive to provide for both convenient auto access and safe, attractive pedestrian access. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.96.020 - Design objectives. 
The design of each commercial project in the city should: 
A.  Reinforce or establish a distinct architectural image; 
B.  Establish attractive, inviting, imaginative and functional site design; 
C.  Facilitate and encourage pedestrian activity and mitigate adverse automotive patterns; 
D.  Enhance surrounding neighborhoods, the uptown area and the city as a whole; 
E.  Preserve and incorporate natural amenities unique to the site such as mature trees and hillside views; and 
F.  Minimize excessive or incompatible impacts of noise, light, traffic and visual character. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.96.030 - Site design guidelines. 
A.  Grading. Grading should be minimized, where possible, to preserve the natural character of the city. Where grading is unavoidable, consider the following guidelines: 
1.  Follow the natural contours as much as possible. 
2.  Round and contour slopes to blend with the existing terrain. 
3.  Emphasize and accentuate scenic vistas. 
4.  Avoid large manufactured slopes in favor of several smaller slopes. 
5.  Retain and incorporate significant natural vegetation into the project. 
6.  Grading should be performed in such manner as to optimize water retention. 
B.  Compatibility. Consideration should be given to the compatibility of proposed uses with existing adjacent uses. A site layout should factor in the surrounding natural and built environment including: 
1.  Relate the project to the surrounding built environment in function, scale and character. 
2.  Tie the project development proposal into adjacent or nearby unique or historic structures. 
3.  Reduce impacts on nearby residential uses by incorporating strategies such as such as appropriate building orientation, intensified landscaping and increased setbacks in project layout. 
4.  Link with compatible surrounding uses through vehicular connections and pedestrian paths. 
C.  Building Siting. 
1.  Entrance Considerations. 
a.  All primary building entries should face onto a street or a connecting walkway. The placement and design of structures should facilitate and encourage pedestrian activity and convey a visual link to the street and sidewalks. Entries that do not front directly onto a street should be connected to a street and the surrounding neighborhood via a landscaped connecting walkway. 
Pedestrian Connection to Neighborhood 
  
b.  Streetside entrances to stores with large floor areas (exceeding ten thousand square feet) are often difficult to achieve. Pedestrian access to these stores can be enhanced by: 
i.  Providing an entry at or near the street, which may be in addition to an entry relating directly to parking; 
ii.  Locating small shops along connecting walkways linking anchor stores to the street; 
iii.  Placing outdoor retail areas along the street such as outdoor seating for anchor store delis; or by 
iv.  Constructing landscaped connecting walkways through parking lots to provide a direct connection to the street. 
c.  A combination of building entries, windows (including display windows) and landscaping are the primary ways that commercial development should front onto streets. Generally, building entries and windows should front onto the street, with the following exceptions: 
i.  Where parking lots and driveways front the street and conform with guidelines contained within "vehicular circulation: access/parking lots"; or, 
ii.  Where the use is auto-serving or service commercial and conforms with "auto serving uses." 
2.  Street Frontage. 
a.  Where a building fronts onto a street, fifty percent of the building's linear streetside frontage should consist of an entrance, window or display window. Streetside buildings with street front parking should not be more than one hundred-feet long without a pedestrian plaza or walkway connecting the parking lot with the street. Auto-serving uses permitted in the commercial zones need not conform to these street frontage requirements. 
b.  On corner lots, buildings should mark the corner with added height, major entry, or other notable architectural feature(s). Buildings with angled corners or plazas are encouraged at corner locations. 
c.  Where a front or corner side setback is required, buildings that front onto the street should meet one of the following conditions: 
i.  The setback should be landscaped with dense, permanently maintained vegetation reaching a height of at least eighteen inches, except where walkways lead to building entries; or 
ii.  The setback may be paved with special pavers or scored concrete three feet by (three feet maximum module size) if building entries occur at least every twenty-five feet or a continuous arcade or trellis is provided. 
3.  Gateway Facades. Facades visible from the San Gabriel River Freeway, Whittier Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard and Colima Road should be especially attractive. These facades should include a major entry feature and fenestration over at least twenty-five of the facade's surface. In addition, a monolithic appearance should be avoided through application of these design guidelines. 
  
Major entry features and façade treatments 
  
Building facade details 
4.  Facades Facing Parking Lots. Where buildings face the street with parking behind, the facade facing the parking lot should contain at least three of the following features: 
  
Preferred building and parking orientation 
a.  Upper-story uses with windows overlooking the parking lot; 
b.  Secondary entrances to ground-floor or upper-story uses; 
c.  Windows (including display windows) occupying at least half of the building's length; 
d.  At least a four-foot change in building plane in every fifty linear feet; 
e.  A trellis or arcade that is at least five-feet deep (clear, unobstructed); or 
f.  A five-foot landscape strip containing trees or other tall vegetation. 
5.  Infill within Existing Development. 
a.  Within existing projects, new buildings are encouraged to reinforce streets as walkable, civic environments and to establish pleasant and convenient pedestrian paths between streets and existing storefronts. 
b.  The architectural style of new buildings should complement the existing center or be the basis for future remodeling for the existing center. 
c.  New construction should be similar to existing buildings in height, width and rhythm of openings. 
  
One story infill 
  
Two Story infill 
d.  Shared plazas or courtyards are encouraged within and across property lines. 
6.  Specific Uses to Consider. 
a.  Auto-serving uses. 
i.  Entries and windows for auto-service uses need not front onto streets. Entries should be linked to the street via a connecting walkway. Avoid facing auto-service bays, loading areas and blank walls toward the street; orient these features to the side or rear while presenting windows, entries and landscaping to the street. Trees or other landscaping should be used to further screen these features when viewed from the street. 
  
Preferred auto-serving retail building 
ii.  When possible, place auto-serving uses near the street, including gas stations, auto service establishments, or other buildings with a floor area under ten thousand square feet or a lot coverage under twenty-five percent (whichever is less). At least twenty-five percent of the linear frontage facing the street should contain windows (excluding clerestory and glassblock) to enhance the street's security and appearance. 
  
Drive-through orientation 
b.  Drive-Through Facilities. Fast food restaurant building entrances should face the street with parking located to the side and rear of the building. Where the size of a parcel may be constraining, one bay of parking may be allowed in front. Design elements, such as trellises, may encroach into the setback when well integrated with the landscape. Landscaped berms and/or low walls shall screen the parking lot and drive-through aisle. Restrooms accessed from outside the structure should not be permitted. Ladders for roof access shall be mounted on the inside of the building, or shall be completely concealed from public view. 
i.  The site design should be pedestrian friendly with opportunities for courtyards, plazas, outdoor dining and landscaped pathways that promote safe and convenient pedestrian movement. 
ii.  Drive-through restaurants should have a drive-through lane that measures a minimum of one hundred forty-four feet in length from entry to pick-up window, accommodating six vehicles. The lane should not enter from the street. The lane should have a minimum width of eleven feet on straight section and twelve feet on curved section. Drive-through lanes should be screened through building orientation, landscaping, low screen walls and trellis work. 
c.  Hotels and Motels. Hotel and motel facades should include bay windows, balconies, arcades, towers and other projections to avoid a monotonous appearance and an overly horizontal composition. Roofs should be hipped or gabled. Tile roofs are encouraged. Roof dormers are also encouraged and should be coordinated with the rhythm of fenestration and bays. Room entrances directly adjacent to parking lots or exterior walkways are discouraged. 
d.  Mixed Use Projects. The architectural style and use of materials should be consistent throughout. Separate site access, parking facilities and entrances should be used. Commercial signage should be restrained. 
7.  Encouraged Site Layout. Create more desirable pedestrian environment by better defining the street edge. Internal parking reduces the negative impact from the street. 
Typical Site Plans 
  
Recommended Site Plan 
  
Source: GERALD A POTTERFIELD 
D.  Vehicular Circulation. Parking lots should generally be placed away from the street, preferably behind buildings. In no case should street frontages consist of uninterrupted parking lots. 
1.  Adequate areas for maneuvering, loading and emergency vehicle access should be accommodated on site. 
2.  Parking areas should be accessed from the street so that circulation to parking areas does not interfere with other site activities. 
3.  Parking areas should be arranged to minimize conflicts with loading activities. 
4.  Large parking lot areas should be divided into a series of smaller connected lots separated by additional landscaping. 
5.  Loading and parking should generally be located to the side and rear of buildings with the exception of handicap and short-term parking lots which may be sited between the street and building entrances. Large expansive paved areas between the street and the building(s) are to be avoided in favor of smaller lots separated by landscaping and buildings. 
6.  Where parking lots occur along streets, a landscaped buffer should be provided to minimize views of parked cars from the street and be permanently maintained: 
a.  The landscaped buffer at the street should be at least fifteen feet wide, excluding parkway landscaping, or ten feet wide if bermed. 
b.  Within the landscaped buffer, trees should be planted at least thirty feet on-center and within five feet of the front property line. 
c.  The landscape buffer should include a screening feature that is thirty-six to forty-two inches in height and consists of a wall, fence, hedge, berm or equivalent. Earth berms should not exceed a 3:1 slope and be rounded and densely landscaped to have a natural appearance. 
7.  Parking lots should be separated from buildings by a five foot landscape strip. 
E.  Pedestrian Circulation. 
1.  Pedestrian access should be provided between transit stops and building entrances. 
2.  Minimize pedestrian crossing distances at driveways. Ideally, a raised median should be used to separate ingress and egress lanes and to provide a pedestrian island, especially where there are three or more lanes. Special pavers, scored concrete or an equivalent treatment should mark pedestrian crossings. 
  
Raised median walkway acts as pedestrian island 
3.  Where possible, connecting walkways should follow an alignment that connects building entries and should be at least eight feet wide in these locations. 
4.  Where connecting walkways pass through parking lots, they should be at least five feet wide (excluding car overhangs) and should be accompanied by a minimum five foot landscape buffer with trees planted at least every thirty feet on-center. 
5.  Walkways should consist of special pavers or scored concrete with modules that should not exceed three feet in width. 
6.  Where a walkway is oversized to accommodate occasional emergency vehicles, landscaping, grass-crete, and other features should be used to give the walkway a more appropriate scale. Meandering walkways should follow the natural terrain and incorporate an irregular pattern. 
  
Connecting walkways 
  
F.  Loading and Storage Areas. 
1.  Loading docks, overhead doors and storage areas should not face streets and freeways, and preferably be located behind or to the side of buildings. 
Where oblique views of these features are possible from streets, freeways, connecting walkways or residences, the features should be screened through the use of walls, wood fences, trellises, tall landscaping, or equivalent features. Loading docks and storage areas should not conflict with connecting walkways. If located adjacent to residential areas, the design of overhead doors should minimize noise through devices such as rubber seals and/or other dampening features. Locate fixed hardware for rolling door on the inside of buildings to minimize visual "clutter." Loading and storage areas should maintain basic visual quality requirements contained in "Building Finishes and Detailing." 
2.  Loading and delivery areas should not be located in required setbacks. 
3.  Loading docks, overhead doors and storage areas should not face streets and freeways, and preferably be located behind or to the side of buildings. Where oblique views of these features are possible from streets, freeways, connecting walkways or residences, the features should be screened through the use of walls, wood fences, trellises, tall landscaping or equivalent features. Loading docks and storage areas should not conflict with connecting walkways. If located adjacent to residential areas, the design of overhead doors should minimize noise through devices such as rubber seals and/or other dampening features. Locate fixed hardware for rolling door on the inside of buildings to minimize visual "clutter." Loading and storage areas should maintain basic visual quality requirements contained in "Building Finishes and Detailing." 
4.  Loading and delivery areas should not be located in required setbacks. 
G.  Plazas, Public Art and Views. 
1.  Plazas. 
a.  Retail centers over ten thousand square feet should provide at least one square foot of plaza area for every one hundred square feet of gross floor area, and employment uses with more than twenty employees should provide at least ten square feet of outdoor plaza area for each employee. Plazas should provide shade, be at least ten feet wide and have decorative paving. If accompanied by a building entry, plazas may occur within front or corner side setbacks, with trellises and similar structures being allowed to project five feet into the front and street side yard setback areas. The plaza area should be calculated separate from areas devoted to connecting walkways. Outdoor seating, tables and umbrellas, public art, water features, landscaping, gazebos or other features are encouraged in plazas and should be consistent with the architectural style of the project. 
  
Retail plaza area 
  
b.  Plazas are encouraged where high levels of pedestrian activity are expected, such as adjacent to major entrances and food services such as delis, restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries. Building entries and windows should look onto plazas to enhance activity and security. 
2.  Public Art. Plazas, entries and gateways should incorporate public art in a manner consistent with the overall architectural theme of the project. Public art should illustrate local history and current events through the appropriate media, such as interpretive landscapes, murals, mosaics, sculptures and artful architectural features integrated into the project design. 
3.  Views. Site circulation and plazas can be used to draw attention to distinctive features such as entrances, public art, fountains, plantings or the local hillsides. 
  
Incorporate view into site design 
H.  Fence and Wall Design. 
1.  Fences and walls should be built with attractive, durable materials, including, but not limited to, redwood, wrought iron, textured concrete block or formed concrete with reveals. Chainlink fencing, corrugated metal fencing and "tennis windscreens" are not permitted. Fences or walls should be consistent with materials and designs used throughout the project. In the event of a wood fence, a protective coating should be applied. 
2.  All fences and walls should have a distinctive cap of different width, material or texture within the top eight inches. Walls should not exceed a height of six feet without being made of textured concrete block, interlocking "diamond" blocks, formed concrete with reveals or similar materials. Wrought iron and dimensional wood should not be used as "zone division" walls that are required adjacent to residential uses for visual and acoustical separation. 
Commercial fencing concepts 
  
3.  At the street, avoid long expanses of uninterrupted fences and walls. Use an opening, planter box, material change, pilaster or post, or a three-foot stagger at least every forty feet. Provide an opening to fences and walls to connect walkways directly to the street and avoid circuitous routes for pedestrians. These pedestrian "gateways" should be announced by pilasters, trellis, special landscaping, public art or other special features. 
4.  In order to soften the mass of a fence or wall, use landscaping such as vines, low to medium height shrubs, and trees appropriate to the architectural style or period of the development. 
5.  Fences and walls adjacent to residences. Where a side or rear property line of a commercial site adjoins a residential zone, a six-foot solid wall shall be required at the adjoining property line. 
6.  Wall design should incorporate graffiti- and vandal-resistant materials that are easily cleaned or painted. 
I.  Refuse. 
1.  Refuse enclosures and equipment should be easily accessed by service vehicles. Locate refuse enclosures and equipment within a building's facade or within a screened enclosure. Reflect the architectural style of adjacent buildings in the design of enclosures, and use similar, high-quality materials. Landscaping or trelliswork should screen enclosures visible from a street or connecting walkway and shall be permanently maintained. 
  
Trash enclosures should reflect design of adjacent structures 
2.  Trash enclosures should be located away from residential uses to minimize nuisance to adjacent properties. 
3.  Cart storage areas should be integrated within the initial building and site design. Large freestanding enclosures or unscreened "cart corrals" are considered unacceptable. 
4.  Outdoor storage areas: Locate outdoor storage areas away from the street, behind or to the side of buildings. In addition to locating storage areas away from streets, walls should be used to screen stored materials. 
J.  Lighting. 
1.  Exterior lighting standards should be located and designed to minimize direct glare beyond the parking lot or service area. Light standards under fifteen feet in height (including lighting bollards) should illuminate all streetside sidewalks and connecting walkways and are encouraged throughout a project. Taller standards, while generally discouraged, may be used only if: 
a.  Reflectors direct light only toward the center of parking areas and at least sixty feet from a residential property; and 
b.  Trees are planted along streets and property lines at a spacing of not more than thirty feet on-center. All light standards should be consistent with the overall architectural style of the project. At a minimum, all light standards should have an attractive base and top; overhanging "shoebox" standards are discouraged; and, overhanging "cobrahead" standards are not permitted. 
2.  Buildings and landscaping can be illuminated indirectly to create a strong positive image. Concealing light features within buildings and landscaping can highlight attractive features and avoid intrusion into neighboring properties. Thoughtful use of attractive pedestrian oriented lighting is especially encouraged at entries, plazas and other areas where evening activity is expected. 
  
  
Complementary light fixtures 
  
Light bollards along walkways 
K.  Drainage. Using various control techniques to limit off-site drainage helps to create a healthier watershed. There are many ways to capture water on-site and divert water underground. All commercial development should integrate water run-off best management practices into the site design. For more information on National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (Clean Water Act) guidelines and best management practices consult the city public works department. 
L.  Site Accessories. 
1.  Site design features, such as recycling bins, bike racks, litter cans, planters, benches and transit shelters, should use materials and have an architectural character consistent with the overall project. Design these features to be graffiti- and vandal-resistant by using materials that are easily cleaned or painted. Avoid interrupting connecting walkways with these features. 
2.  Site amenities within a commercial setting should be coordinated in terms of color, materials and design in order to convey a cohesive project appearance and distinctive character. 
M.  Auxiliary Structures and Areas. All auxiliary structures should be integrated architecturally with the project through their color, materials and architectural style. The location of auxiliary areas is essential to the success of a business. For example, outdoor dining areas should be placed as close to the front yard or street side yard setback as possible; at the very least, outdoor dining areas should be visible from the street. 
1.  Transit Shelters. Where a transit stop is planned adjacent to a project that is at least five acres, the developer should coordinate with the public works department and the transit department to determine a location for a transit shelter on-site. Transit shelters that are incorporated within the form of a building such as under an awning or arcade are encouraged. 
  
Transit shelters should be integrated architecturally 
2.  Play Places. Play structures associated with commercial uses should be enclosed and integrated within the building design. If the play place is a secondary use, then the size of the play structures and the portion of the building containing the play area should be subordinate to the main use and building. 
3.  Outdoor Dining Areas. Outdoor dining areas are encouraged and should provide permanent shade. Small to medium height landscaping and non-view obscuring fences should be utilized to help define outdoor dining areas. 
4.  Vending Machines. All vending machines should be located inside the store. Vending machines may be placed outside of a store if they are not visible from the public right of way and their placement is architecturally integrated into the design of the development. 
N.  Screening Equipment. All screening equipment should be designed so that these features are graffiti- and vandal-resistant by providing, at minimum, a two foot wide landscape strip at the base of these walls for vines and tall shrubs, and by using materials that are treated accordingly, and easily cleaned or painted. 
  
Trellis over drive-through 
1.  Mechanical Equipment. 
a.  The location of mechanical equipment should be integrated into the project's site and building design. Roof-top and ground-mounted equipment should be architecturally screened from view of elevated highways, streets, parking lots, connecting walkways and the freeway. 
b.  Mechanical equipment must be screened behind parapets or by recessing equipment into hips, gables, parapets or similar features; exposed boxes are not acceptable. Screening details should incorporate "capping" elements and the same exterior trim details as found elsewhere in the project. The top of screens should be at least as high as the top of the equipment, yet the screen walls should be generally kept as low as possible. If public ways have an elevation that is equal to or above the elevation of equipment, a section should be prepared which shows the relationship of the equipment to the public way and the manner in which this view will be screened. 
Mechanical equipment 
  
  
  
2.  Transformers 
a.  Transformers, heating units and other ground-mounted equipment should be adequately screened with architecturally integrated walls and/or landscaping. Additional area for future ground-mounted equipment and screening needs should be considered and set aside. Avoid interrupting connecting walkways with these features. 
b.  Transformers should not dominate the streetscape. When transformers are required to be installed adjacent to the street, they should be underground. 
Freestanding transformer location 
  
3.  Downspouts. Downspouts should be concealed on facades that face a street or freeway. 
O.  Landscaping. All landscaping should be completed in a timely manner so as to minimize erosion of slopes and off-site drainage. The following landscaping principles should also be considered: 
1.  Use a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees to provide year-round interest. 
a.  Use evergreen trees to block winter winds and screen unsightly features. 
b.  Provide special landscaping treatment, such as intensifying density (size and/or number) of trees, accent trees, and special paving at all project entries and building entries. 
c.  Provide shade/canopy trees within parking areas at a ratio of one shade tree for every five parking stalls. 
d.  Use plants to define outdoor spaces such as edges, outdoor plazas, or movement paths between parking and building entrances. 
e.  Plant trees to provide a continuity of form across the entire project. 
2.  Landscape at Walls. 
a.  A five-foot landscape strip (excluding wall footings and car overhangs) should be provided at the base of all solid fences and walls, and at the base of buildings, except where there are entrances or loading areas. 
b.  These landscape strips should be planted with trees, hedges, vines or similar treatment and permanently maintained. 
3.  Period appropriate landscaping is encouraged. Use landscape specimens appropriate to architectural design theme. 
4.  Drought tolerant, native plants should be a priority. 
5.  The developer should construct an automatic irrigation system. 
P.  Paving. 
1.  Decorative paving should be incorporated into parking lot design, driveway entries and pedestrian walkways. 
2.  Paving materials should complement the architectural design. The use of stamped concrete, stone, brick, pavers, exposed aggregate, or colored concrete is encouraged. 
3.  The following permeable pavements are encouraged, where appropriate to the existing or new building architecture or theme: 
a.  Poured in place: pervious concrete and porous asphalt 
b.  Unit Pavers: brick, natural stone 
c.  Granular materials: gravel, cobbles. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.96.040 - Architectural design guidelines. 
A.  Style. 
1.  Construction should render the well chosen style through appropriate detailing, properly applied materials and quality workmanship. A consistent architectural style shall be used for a building and the elements that relate to it, such as trellises, planters or light-standards. Multi-building projects should also use a consistent architectural style. While specific architectural styles are not dictated by the zoning code, several styles predominate in the city and should be emulated to help keep the city's unique "sense of place." 
2.  Styles generally respond to the region's climate. For example, a Mediterranean design should incorporate shade windows, outdoor circulation and outdoor courtyard or plazas with deep eaves, recessed window frames, awnings, arcades, loggias, trellises and trees. Other predominant styles include craftsman, victorian, mission, art deco modern and italianate. Alternative styles are permissible, provided they meet the requirements listed throughout these guidelines. Skyscraper like "high tech" styles with unarticulated surfaces and insubstantial materials should be avoided. 
3.  The selected architectural style/design should consider compatibility with surrounding character, including harmonious building style, form, size, color, materials and roofline. In developed areas, infill projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality which have been set by surrounding development. 
4.  The use of standardized "corporate" architectural styles associated with franchises is discouraged. Corporate architecture should be modified to meet the city's design guidelines with some consideration to maintaining corporate identification. 
5.  The designer is expected to employ variations in form, building details and siting in order to create visual interest. In all cases, the selected architectural style should be employed on all building elevations. 
B.  Massing. The mass and roof forms of buildings should be varied, especially with larger projects. Different heights may be used to communicate different uses or shops. Bay windows and stepped buildings also create added visual interest and relate directly to the pedestrian environment. An arcade provides another means of connecting varied masses and a more comfortable experience along pedestrian routes. Higher tower elements or similar features are encouraged at focal points, such as plazas, major entrances or where walkways meet streets. 
  
C.  Entry Design. 
1.  Gables, awnings, sign locations or other features should clearly express the location of doorways. Greater attention should be given to materials and detailing adjacent to entries. 
Entry design 
  
2.  "Notch" the street side of buildings to gain access for landscaping and to provide architectural variation. 
  
Notch 
D.  Features. 
1.  Arcades and Awnings. Outdoor arcades are encouraged to protect pedestrians from summer heat and winter rain. Where an arcade is not provided, a separate awning or other architectural feature should be used for each business to enhance the individual identity of small shops. Because they can quickly deteriorate, canvas awnings are discouraged and, when used, shall be properly maintained. 
  
Outdoor arcade 
2.  Upper-Story Uses. Upper-story uses with bay windows and balconies are encouraged to provide informal surveillance, and create a pleasant sense of enclosure, especially around plazas and along streets. Lobbies for upper-story uses should clearly be expressed through gables, awnings, special materials, or other architectural treatments. Bay windows and balconies are encouraged and should not appear to be cantilevered for more than six inches without visible blocking, brackets, corbels or posts. 
3.  Roof Forms. Roof forms should be simple and reflect the internal organization of buildings. Hipped and gable roofs are encouraged. Flat roof parapets should be accompanied by a cornice or other shadow-creating detail at its "top." 
4.  Drive-Up Windows. Construct roofs or trellises over drive-up windows. Posts supporting roofs or trellises should be substantial in appearance. Integrate these features into the overall architecture of the project. The stacking area for drive-up windows should be screened from the street through a combination of berming, low walls and landscaping. 
E.  Building Treatment, Finishes and Detailing. 
1.  Building Facades. 
a.  Buildings should not be monotonous or have a flat, shadowless appearance on any side. No wall should have a blank, uninterrupted length exceeding twenty feet without including one of the following: change in texture, change in plane (two-foot minimum), window (excluding clerestory windows and glass block), public art, lattice, tree or equivalent element. Facades that are visible from adjacent streets or walkways should display even greater visual interest by using architectural elements that break up the massing of large buildings, such as windows, arcades, porticos and other architectural features. 
  
Top treatment 
  
Base treatment 
b.  All facades should have a recognizable "base" and "top." The base should visually carry the weight of the building. A recommended rule of thumb is approximately one-eighth of a building's height, unless associated with window stem walls where it may be as little as eighteen inches tall. Techniques for establishing a base include, but are not limited to, the following: 
i.  Thicker walls; 
ii.  Richly textured materials (e.g. tile or masonry treatments); 
iii.  Darker colored materials, mullion, and/or panels; and/or 
iv.  Enriched landscaping with a mature height of at least eighteen inches and permanently maintained. 
c.  Special materials, such as ceramic tile, granite and marble, are encouraged on the base of buildings that face streets or connecting walkways, especially adjacent to major entries. 
d.  "Tops" take advantage of the visual prominence of a building's silhouette and should be approximately one-twentieth of a building's height or twelve inches (whichever is more). Techniques for clearly expressing a top include, but are not limited to, the following: 
i.  Cornice treatments; 
ii.  Roof overhangs with brackets; 
iii.  Stepped parapets; 
iv.  Richly textured materials (e.g. tile or masonry treatments); and/or 
v.  Different colored materials. 
e.  Colored "stripes" are not acceptable as the only treatment. 
2.  Quality of Construction. Give an attractive appearance to all facades through careful and correct detailing, especially at the base of buildings, along cornices, eaves, parapets or ridgetops, and around entries and windows. Details for these conditions may be requested as part of development review. Appearance may also be enhanced through the correct use of materials, expansion joints and reveals. 
3.  Exterior Materials. High quality building materials are encouraged. Recommended materials include brick, stucco, exterior plaster, wood siding, tile or stone. Veneers that are visibly prefabricated are discouraged. Materials and detailing should have a substantial and long-lasting appearance. 
4.  Material Changes. To avoid the false appearance of lightweight veneers, material changes should not occur at external corners. Material changes may occur at "reverse" or interior corners or as a "return" at least two feet from external corners. 
5.  Windows. To provide a base element and greater safety, window frames should generally be set upon a stem wall or framed panel that is at least eighteen inches high. In addition, window frames should be substantial and should be framed or inset to establish an attractive shadow, flush with the exterior finish. Glazing inset at least two inches from the front face of the exterior finish is encouraged. 
6.  Roof Materials. Roofing materials should be durable and display frequent, clearly marked shadow lines. Roofing materials that are generally acceptable include metal standing seam, concrete tile, ceramic tile and slate or slate-like materials. Non-acceptable roofing materials include all combustible or non-fire-rated roofing materials, "roll roofing" and lightweight asphalt shingles. 
7.  Colors. For larger building surfaces (excluding trim), colors should be muted and lighter in value. (Muted colors contain a mix of complementary colors that result in off-whites, tans and other "softer colors." Lighter colors have a value equivalent to thirty percent or less on a gray scale.) Accent colors may include brighter and darker colors.

Chapter 18.98 - MANUFACTURING DESIGN GUIDELINES 
 
18.98.010 - Design goals. 
Manufacturing development has typically been physically and visually isolated from other city land uses in the past. The very nature of early manufacturing dictated a function-over-form design of large-scale developments on the outskirts of town. Rapid urban growth and technological advances in industry have blurred the spatial and visual gap between manufacturing and other uses. For this reason, the manufacturing design guidelines are intended to promote high quality development that will: 
A.  Provide for function while promoting high quality architecture, landscaping and design; 
B.  Integrate or transition land uses through sensitive siting and design; 
C.  Ensure compatibility with other parts of the community; and 
D.  Enhance the street environment for motorists and pedestrians. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.98.020 - Design objectives. 
The design of each manufacturing project in the city should: 
A.  Reinforce or establish a distinct architectural image; 
B.  Consider the scale, proportion and character of surrounding development; 
C.  Establish attractive, inviting, imaginative and functional design; 
D.  Provide convenient pedestrian connections between employment locations and services; 
E.  Provide for safe on-site pedestrian activity and avoid adverse traffic problems; 
F.  Minimize excessive or incompatible impacts of noise, light, traffic and visual character; 
G.  Preserve and incorporate natural amenities unique to the site such as mature trees and hillside views; and 
H.  Preserve and incorporate historically, culturally, or architecturally significant buildings into the project design. 
(Ord. 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.98.030 - Site design guidelines. 
A.  Grading. Grading should be minimized where possible to preserve the natural character of the city. Where grading is unavoidable, consider the following guidelines: 
1.  Follow the natural contours as much as possible. 
2.  Round and contour slopes to blend with the existing terrain. 
3.  Emphasize and accentuate scenic vistas. 
4.  Avoid large manufactured slopes in favor of several smaller slopes. 
5.  Retain and incorporate significant natural vegetation into the project. 
6.  Graded slopes should be landscaped for aesthetic and slope stability purposes. 
7.  Optimize on-site water retention basins. 
B.  Compatibility. Consideration should be given to the compatibility of proposed uses with existing adjacent uses. A site layout should factor in the surrounding natural and built environment including: 
1.  Relate the project to the surrounding built environment in function, scale and character. 
2.  Tie the project development proposal into adjacent or nearby unique or historic structures. 
3.  Reduce impacts on nearby residential uses by incorporating strategies such as appropriate building orientation, intensified landscaping and increased setbacks in project layout. 
4.  Link with compatible surrounding uses through vehicular connections and pedestrian paths. 
C.  Building Siting. Building siting should consider the context of the surrounding area, location of incompatible uses, location of major traffic generators and site characteristics, when applying the following guidelines: 
Recommended site orientation 
  
1.  Front the entries, buildings, office areas, and windows onto the street; 
2.  Give attention to public view, both on- and off-site; 
3.  Vary building setbacks to provide relief from long monotonous facades; 
4.  Increase building setbacks as height increases; and 
5.  Cluster buildings to create plazas and courtyards. 
D.  Site Entry. Major vehicular and pedestrian entries to manufacturing developments should create visible "gateways" through the use of: 
1.  Decorative, textured paving; 
2.  Accent trees and ornamental landscaping; 
3.  Low profile monument signage; and 
4.  Pedestrian plazas where site entries are adjacent to a building entry. 
  
Site entry design treatments 
  
E.  Vehicular Circulation. 
1.  Adequate areas for maneuvering, stacking, truck staging, loading and emergency vehicle access should be accommodated on site. 
2.  Parking areas should be accessed from the street so that circulation to parking areas does not interfere with other site activities. 
3.  Parking areas should be arranged to minimize conflicts with loading activities. 
4.  Large parking lot areas should be divided into a series of smaller connected lots separated by additional landscaping. 
5.  Loading and parking should generally be located to the side and rear of buildings with the exception of visitor and short-term parking lots which may be sited between the street and building entrances. Large expansive paved areas between the street and the building(s) are to be avoided in favor of smaller lots separated by landscaping and buildings. 
6.  Where parking lots occur along streets, a landscaped buffer should be provided to minimize views of parked cars from the street and be permanently maintained: 
a.  The landscaped buffer at the street should be at least fifteen feet wide, excluding parkway landscaping, or ten feet wide if bermed. Within the landscaped buffer, trees should be planted at least thirty feet on-center and within five feet of the front property line. 
Landscape screen 
  
b.  The landscape buffer should include a screening feature that is thirty-six to forty-two inches in height and consist of a wall, fence, hedge, berm or equivalent. Earth berms should not exceed a 3:1 slope and be rounded and densely landscaped to have a natural appearance. 
c.  Parking lots should be separated from buildings by a five foot landscape strip. 
  
Streetscape design 
F.  Pedestrian Circulation. 
1.  Walkways should connect major building entries with the public sidewalk along the street. 
2.  Pedestrian walkways should be adjacent to buildings and be overlooked by frequent entries or windows. 
3.  Connecting walkways should be at least four feet wide (excluding car overhangs) and should be accompanied by a five foot minimum landscape buffer with trees planted at least every thirty feet on-center. 
4.  Walkways with decorative pavers or other special design treatment are preferred. 
5.  Walkways should provide a direct route without conflicting with parking and loading areas, and vehicular access and egress points to the parking areas. 
6.  Pedestrian access should be provided between transit stops and building entrances. 
  
G.  Loading, Delivery and Storage Areas. 
1.  Loading and storage areas should not face streets. When these features must face a street, they must be screened with a solid decorative wall or berm. Where oblique views of these features are possible from streets, freeways, connecting walkways or residences, the features should be screened through the use of walls, trellises, tall landscaping or equivalent features. 
  
  
2.  Section plans should be prepared to show that the wall height is sufficient to screen the loading area, vehicles and trailers from view of adjacent properties and streets. 
3.  Adequate room should be provided for trucks maneuvering or waiting to unload; the area within one hundred twenty feet in front of loading docks should be paved and kept free of obstacles. 
4.  Loading and storage areas should not conflict with connecting walkways or required parking areas. 
5.  Loading and delivery areas should not be located in required setback areas. 
6.  Loading areas should be designed to include attractive and durable materials. Design considerations for loading and storage areas include: 
a.  Locate fixed hardware for rolling doors on the inside of buildings to minimize visual "clutter." 
b.  In the loading and storage areas, building segments above loading doors visible from the street and surrounding properties should conform with other guidelines pertaining to building features, materials and finishes. 
c.  If located adjacent to residential areas, the design of overhead doors should minimize noise through devices such as rubber seals and/or other dampening features. 
d.  Outdoor storage shall not exceed eight feet in height. A lower grade of loading docks is encouraged, where practical, to help minimize views from the street and the need for tall walls or fencing. 
H.  Plazas. Plazas are encouraged as a site amenity and design detail. 
  
Outdoor plaza design 
1.  Arrange buildings to include opportunities for plazas, courts or gardens, and lunch areas for employees with such amenities as outdoor seating, landscaping, water elements, pergolas, special lighting and other "place-making" features. 
2.  Plazas are encouraged where high levels of pedestrian activity are expected, such as adjacent to major entrances and food services such as delis, restaurants and bakeries or between building clusters in a business park development. 
3.  Building entries and windows should look onto plazas to enhance activity and security. 
4.  Locate outdoor employee break areas preferably away from loading areas or other high-traffic areas. 
I.  Fence and Wall Design. 
  
Fences and walls 
1.  Materials. Fences and walls in public view should be built with attractive durable materials, including, but not limited to, wrought iron, textured concrete block or formed concrete with reveals. Fences or walls should be consistent with materials and designs used throughout the project. Sliding gates to loading areas visible from a street should be constructed with wrought iron and high density perforated metal screening, painted to match or complement adjacent walls. Site entries requiring gates should be offset from direct view to loading areas, where possible, to minimize extent of screening, and avoid direct view to loading areas when gates are open. 
2.  Height. Street side fences or walls should adequately screen views to the top of loading bays and parked vehicles and/or trailers. The height of screen walls outside the setback areas should not exceed twelve feet from the highest finished grade. The area in front of walls and fences should be landscaped with shrubs and trees reaching a mature height that exceeds the height of the wall or fence. Additional landscaping should be used when walls exceed seven feet in height. 
3.  Special Design Considerations. Along street frontages, avoid long expanses of uninterrupted fences and walls. Long expanses of wall surfaces should be offset and architecturally treated to prevent monotony. Techniques to accomplish this treatment may include, but are not limited to, the following: raised planters, openings, material change, staggered sections, and pilasters or posts. Vegetation should be used in conjunction with these suggestions, but should not be used in place of special wall treatments. Provide openings to fences and walls to connect walkways directly to the street and avoid circuitous routes for pedestrians. These pedestrian "gateways" should be announced by pilasters, trellises, special landscaping, or other special features. Landscape berms should be provided to minimize the height impact of screen walls. 
4.  Fences and Walls Adjacent to Non-Industrial Uses. Where manufacturing uses are adjacent to non-manufacturing uses, appropriate buffering techniques such as setbacks, screening, and landscaping need to be provided to mitigate any negative effects of manufacturing uses. 
J.  Refuse. 
1.  Refuse containers and equipment shall be easily accessed by service vehicles, but screened from public view. 
2.  Locate refuse containers and equipment within a building's facade or within a screened enclosure. Reflect the architectural style or significant architectural elements of adjacent buildings in the design of enclosures, and use similar, high-quality materials. 
3.  Landscaping or trelliswork should be provided on each side of screened enclosures within parking areas and when visible from a street or connecting walkway. (See development standards for minimum size) 
  
Refuse container enclosures 
K.  Lighting. 
1.  Exterior lighting standards should be located and designed to minimize direct glare beyond the parking lot or service area. Light standards under twenty-five feet in height (including lighting bollards) are encouraged throughout a project and should illuminate all sidewalks and connecting walkways. 
  
Complementary light fixtures 
  
Light bollards along walkways 
  
Bollards along entry 
Taller standards may be used only if: 
a.  Reflectors direct light only toward the center of parking areas and at least sixty feet from a residential property; and 
b.  Trees are planted along streets and property lines at a spacing of not more than thirty feet on-center. 
2.  All light standards should be consistent with respect to design, materials, color, light color and with the overall architectural style of the project. At a minimum, all light standards should have an attractive base and top; overhead "cobrahead" standards are not permitted. Buildings and landscaping can be illuminated indirectly to create a strong positive image. 
3.  Concealing light features within buildings and landscaping can highlight attractive features and avoid intrusion into neighboring properties. Use of lighting is especially encouraged at entries, plazas and other areas where evening activity is expected. 
  
L.  Drainage. Using various control techniques to limit off-site drainage helps to create a healthier watershed. There are many ways to capture water on-site and divert water underground. Residential development should integrate water runoff best management practices into the site design. For more information on National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (Clean Water Act) guidelines and best management practices, consult the city public works department. 
M.  Site Accessories. 
1.  Site features, such as recycling bins, bike racks, litter cans, planters, and benches should be designed as an integral part of the project. Architectural character and use of materials should be consistent with the overall project. Design these features to be graffiti- and vandal-resistant by using materials that are easily cleaned or painted. Avoid interrupting connecting walkways with these features. 
2.  Site amenities within a manufacturing setting should be coordinated in terms of color, materials and design in order to convey a cohesive project appearance and distinctive character. 
N.  Auxiliary Structures. Transit shelters should be provided near major concentrations of employees. Where a transit stop is planned adjacent to a project of at least five acres, the developer should coordinate with the transit department to determine a suitable location for a transit shelter on-site. Freestanding shelters should be integrated architecturally with the project with respect to color, materials and architectural style. 
  
Multi-model shelter 
(Ord 2786 Exh. A (part), 2001)  
18.98.040 - Architectural design guidelines. 
A.  Style. 
1.  A consistent architectural style should be used for a building and the elements that relate to it, such as trellises, planters, light standards, etc. Multi-building projects should also use a consistent architectural style. 
2.  Consideration should be given to the architectural and site design of a proposed project with those of existing adjacent uses. Also, projects that abut residentially and commercially zoned properties should be designed in such a manner so as to minimize the massing and effects typically associated with large manufacturing buildings. 
3.  An attractive appearance to all facades should be provided through careful detailing, especially at the base of buildings, along cornices, eaves, parapets or ridgetops, and around entries and windows. (Details for these conditions may be requested as part of development review). Appearance may also be enhanced through the correct use of materials, expansion joints, and reveals. 
B.  Massing. A single, dominant building mass should be avoided. Substantial variations in massing should include changes in height and horizontal plane. 
1.  Horizontal masses for building elevations less than seven hundred lineal feet should not exceed a height/width ratio of 1:5 without a substantial architectural element that projects up or away from the building, such as towers, bays, lattices, or other architectural features. 
2.  Buildings greater than seven hundred lineal feet should not exceed a height/width ratio of 1:6 without massing variations. 
3.  A ratio of 1:10 may be considered for facades greater than seven hundred lineal feet with external treatment detached from the building to help break the mass of the structure between massing breaks, including columns, colonnades, trellises or enhanced landscape treatment. 
  
Massing ratios 
Massing and building projections 
  
The extent of massing breaks and building projections should relate visually to the overall scale of the building. 
C.  Entry Design. 
  
1.  Building Facades. 
Avoid blank walls between massing breaks, especially along facades immediately visible from adjacent streets or walkways, by using one or more of the following techniques: 
a.  Change in texture; 
b.  Revealed pilaster; 
c.  Change in plane (two-foot minimum); 
d.  Vertical variation of roof line; 
e.  Window; and 
f.  Lattice, accent tree or equivalent. 
2.  Gateway Facades. Facades visible from freeways and major street corridors should be especially attractive. These facades should include a major entry feature and fenestration over at least twenty-five percent of the facade's surface. In addition, a monolithic appearance should be avoided. 
Gateway facades 
  
3.  Major Entries. 
a.  Highlight primary building entries through the massing of the building. Greater height can be used to highlight and accentuate entries in the form of corner tower elements, tall voids, or a central mass meeting an entry plaza. Conversely, smaller building masses can also communicate the location of entries. 
Entry design 
  
b.  Contrasting forms can also be used to help highlight major entry points on large building facades. Elements such as curved and straight lines, cylindrical corner elements with sharp corners help highlight major entry points on manufacturing buildings. 
4.  Pedestrian Entries. 
a.  Entries and windows are encouraged to face streets and pedestrian walkways. 
b.  Projects with few employees should attempt to place entries and the most active areas near the street to avoid long, "unguarded" walkways. Incorporate special materials, color, detailing, or equivalent architectural treatment at major entries. 
  
D.  Building Treatment, Finishes and Detailing. 
1.  Base and Top Treatments. 
Facades having a recognizable "base" and "top" are encouraged. 
  
a.  The "base" should visually relate to the proportion and scale of the building. Techniques for establishing a base include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Richly textured materials (e.g., tile or masonry treatments); 
ii.  Darker colored materials, mullion, panels, reveals; and 
iii.  Enriched landscaping. 
  
Base treatment 
b.  "Tops" take advantage of the visual prominence of a building's silhouette. Techniques for clearly expressing a top may include, but are not limited to: 
  
Top treatment 
  
Acceptable top design techniques 
i.  Cornice treatments, 
ii.  Roof overhangs with brackets, 
iii.  Richly textured materials (e.g. tile, masonry or fluted concrete), and/or 
iv.  Different colored materials. 
c.  Colored "stripes" are not acceptable as the only treatment. Texture, reveals and color may be appropriate in some applications. Vertical expressions that comply with the General Massing section may be considered as an alternative for "top" treatment on large distribution buildings. 
2.  Roof Materials. 
a.  Roofline. Vertical variations to the roofline should incorporate roof projections, to avoid a false front/unfinished appearance. Rear elevations screened from public view may be excluded. 
  
External treatment for long elevations 
b.  Roof Form and Materials. Vertical roof forms should be simple, avoid a massive appearance, and reflect the internal organization of buildings. Roofing materials should be durable. Where visible from the street, acceptable roofing materials include metal standing seam and concrete tile. 
3.  Material Changes. Avoid the false appearance of lightweight veneers by hiding material changes through careful detailing. Material changes should not occur at externals corners. Material changes may occur at "reverse" or interior corners or as a "return" at least four feet from external corners, with extended returns provided for large buildings. 
  
Materials should turn corner 
4.  Colors. For larger building surfaces (excluding trim), colors should be muted and other "softer colors". Lighter colors have a value equivalent to thirty percent or less on a gray scale. Accent colors may include brighter and darker colors. 
5.  Downspouts. Downspouts should be concealed on facades that face a street or freeway, or should be architecturally integrated into the design of the building. 
6.  Windows. Window frames should appear substantial and should not be flush with the exterior finish. Glazing should be inset at least two inches from the front face of the exterior finish. On windows facing a public right-of-way or facing a plaza, bare aluminum finishes are discouraged, except when designed as a critical element of the overall architectural design. 
7.  Mechanical Equipment Screening. Mechanical equipment screening should be integrated as part of a project's site and building design. 
a.  Rooftop and ground-mounted equipment should be screened from view of streets, parking lots, connecting walkways and freeways. 
b.  Integrate rooftop equipment into the overall mass of a building. 
c.  Screen roof-mounted equipment through the use of parapets, screen walls, equipment wells, mechanical room enclosures and similar design features. Screening devices other than parapet walls shall be designed as an integral element of the building mass. 
d.  Picket fencing, chain-link fencing and metal boxes shall be avoided. 
e.  The top of screens should be at least as high as the top of the equipment, with additional height provided where larger equipment units could be used in the future. 
Mechanical equipment screening 
  
  
f.  Cross-section drawings should be prepared to illustrate the method in which the equipment will be screened from view of adjacent streets, freeways and properties. 
g.  Typical ground-mounted equipment (such as transformers and heating units) should be screened with walls and/or landscaping. 
h.  Large structures and/or equipment such as water tanks, silos and large bins should be screened by the building from view of adjacent streets, freeways and properties.
