§1521 FORMAL CONTRACT PROCEDURE

When formal public bidding to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is required by this code or applicable state law, the city shall invite bids and award contracts using the following procedures and such other or different applicable procedures as may be required by state law or other provisions of this code:

A.    Notice Inviting Bids: Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased or services to be rendered and shall state where bid blanks, specifications and plans (if applicable) may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids, all in accordance with policies adopted by the city council.

1. Published Notice: Notices inviting bids shall be published at least ten (10) days before the date of opening of the bids or for such longer period as may be required by state law, such as the California uniform public construction cost accounting act1. Notices shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the city, and on the city’s website, or if there is none, it shall be posted in at least three (3) public places in the city that have been designated by ordinance as the places for posting public notices.

2. Bidders List: The purchasing officer shall also solicit sealed bids from all responsible prospective suppliers whose names are on the bidders list or who have made written request that their names be added thereto.

B.    Bidder’s Security: When deemed necessary by the purchasing officer, bidder’s security may be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; provided, however, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his bid security upon his refusal or failure to execute the contract within ten (10) days after the notice of award of contract has been mailed, unless in the latter event the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the contract. The city council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. If the city council rejects all bids presented and readvertises, due to a refusal of the lowest bidder to enter into a contract, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security may be used to offset the cost of receiving new bids with the surplus, if any, being returned to the lowest bidder.

C.    Bid Opening Procedure: Sealed bids shall be submitted to a city official designated in the notice inviting bids and shall be identified as "bids" on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days after the bid opening.

D.    Rejection Of Bids: In its discretion, and to the extent and according to the procedures required by law, the city council may reject any and all bids presented and readvertise for bids pursuant to the procedure hereinabove prescribed.

E.    Lowest Responsible Bidder: Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder submitting a responsive bid. In determining "lowest responsible bidder", in addition to price, the city council shall consider:

1. The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;

2. Whether the bidder can perform the contract, or provide the service promptly or within the time specified, without delay or interference;

3. The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder;

4. The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinance relating to the contract of service;

5. The quality of performance of previous contracts of service;

6. The sufficiency of financial resources and ability of bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;

7. The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies, or contractual services to the particular use required;

8. The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract;

9. The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.

F.    Award To Other Than Low Bidder: When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for placing the order elsewhere shall be prepared by the agent and filed with the other papers relating to the transaction.

G.    Tie Bids: If two (2) or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may in its discretion accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by and after negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening.

H.    Performance Bonds: The city council shall have authority to require performance and payments bonds before entering a contract in such amount as it shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the city council requires such bonds, the form and amount shall be described in the notice inviting bids.

I.    Bidders In Default To City: The agent shall not accept the bid of a contractor or supplier who is in default on the payment of taxes, licenses or other monies due the city. (Ord. 667, §2, adopted 1975; Ord. 766, §1, adopted 1981; Ord. 1086, §1, adopted 2006)

§1750 TITLE

This chapter shall be known as the UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX ORDINANCE of the city. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1751 DEFINITIONS

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this ordinance:

HOTEL: Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof.

OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

OPERATOR: The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this ordinance and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

TAX ADMINISTRATOR: The director of finance of the city.

TRANSIENT: Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted period of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date hereof may be considered. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1752 TAX IMPOSED

Each transient paying for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965; Ord. 601, §1, adopted 1968; Ord. 657, §1, adopted 1974; Ord. 831, §1, adopted 19841; Ord. 842, §1, adopted 1984; Ord. 902, §1, adopted 1990; Ord. 1089, adopted 2006)


§1753 EXEMPTIONS

No tax shall be imposed upon:

A.    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;

B.    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1754 OPERATOR’S DUTIES

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1755 REGISTRATION

Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A.    The name of the operator;

B.    The address of the hotel;

C.    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

D.    The transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1756 REPORTING AND REMITTING

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar month, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him/her of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax, and he may require further information on the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this ordinance shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965; Ord. 936, §1, adopted 1993)


§1757 PENALTIES AND INTEREST

A.    Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this ordinance within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B.    Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.

C.    If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this ordinance is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.

D.    In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this ordinance shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.    Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1758 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX ADMINISTRATOR

If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this ordinance, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this ordinance, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this ordinance and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this ordinance. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the united states mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five (5) days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in §1759. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1759 APPEAL

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The finding of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1760 RECORDS

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by this ordinance to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1761 REFUNDS

A.    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City under this ordinance it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this Section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

B.    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C.    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this Section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1762 ACTIONS TO COLLECT

Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this ordinance shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 567, §1, adopted 1965)


§1763 VIOLATIONS; MISDEMEANOR

B.    Compliance with Regulations Required: Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Tax Administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this ordinance to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

D.    In making a determination on whether to approve the transfer application, the city council shall consider the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee to operate the system, whether the incumbent cable system operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this article and, if not, the candidate transferee’s commitment and plan to cure such noncompliance, whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, and such other criteria provided for by applicable state and federal law.

E.    A transfer application shall not be granted unless the proposed transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this article, the franchise agreement, and such other agreements, regulations or restrictions that pertain to the franchise, assume the obligations and liabilities of the previous grantee under the franchise, and assume such other conditions as may be prescribed by the city council resolution approving the transfer.

F.    Approval by the city of a transfer application does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this article or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)

Where feasible, the city shall provide notice to the holder of a foreign franchise of the city’s intent to annex territory that may result in a termination under this section. Failure to provide such notice shall not affect the termination of the foreign franchise.

D.    Where grantee of a foreign franchise has commenced installation of a cable system in annexed territory on or before the date such annexation becomes effective, grantee may continue to provide cable services to the annexed territory for the balance of the initial term of said franchise (exclusive of any renewal or extension not granted by the city), subject to the terms and conditions then in effect under such franchise, and the timely payment to the city of all franchise fees paid in connection with such service (or such other fees imposed by the city up to the maximum permitted by law).

C.    The city council shall hold a noticed public hearing on the application. Written notice shall be given at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing on the application.

In addition, grantee shall comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding pole attachments. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)

If the city’s actual costs in processing and reviewing the application are less than the amount of the fee, any remaining funds from the fee shall be refunded to the applicant within sixty (60) days after final approval or denial of their application. In the event that the deposit is less than the city’s actual costs, grantee shall pay such additional costs to the city within thirty (30) days after written notice from the city that such additional payment is required.

B.    Any application fees are exclusive of grantee’s obligation to pay other costs and fees required by this article, the franchise agreement or the franchise, including, without limitation, construction inspection fees, permit fees, and franchise fees. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)


§1885 FRANCHISE FEE

A.    As compensation for any franchise granted, and in consideration of permission to use the public right of way in the operation of its cable system, and because the city will incur costs (other than application fees) in regulating and administering the franchise, grantee shall pay to the city a franchise fee in the amount equal to five percent (5%) of grantee’s gross revenues, or such other amount as the city council may set by resolution or specify in the franchise agreement.

B.    The franchise fee assessed shall be paid quarterly, to be received by the city treasurer not later than forty five (45) days after the close of each quarter of grantee’s fiscal year.

C.    On a quarterly basis, grantee shall provide the city a complete and accurate statement verified by a financial officer of grantee indicating gross revenues for the past quarter, listing every revenue source, and depicting gross revenue computations.

D.    On an annual basis, grantee shall file a complete and accurate statement certified by grantee’s chief financial officer, indicating all gross revenues for said year, listing every revenue source, and depicting gross revenue computations. If the city has any concerns or objections relating to such report, the city shall have sixty (60) days to notify grantee and request additional information. Grantee shall have sixty (60) days to provide additional information to resolve any concerns or objections to the city’s satisfaction. Thereafter, the city may, at its sole discretion, request that such statement be certified by an independent certified public accountant, at grantee’s sole cost; provided, however, that any such request shall be made within sixty (60) days after grantee’s response is received.

E.    At any time during the term of a franchise, the city shall have the right to conduct, or require grantee to obtain, an independent audit by certified public accountants of any and all records of grantee that are related to gross revenue reports or computations. Grantee shall pay the costs of such audit not more frequently than once every five (5) years or upon a proposed transfer or change of control of the franchise. Grantee shall cooperate with any such audit making readily available any and all information requested by the city. The certified public accountants shall be required to certify in the audit that the grantee is in compliance with this article and the franchise agreement. Grantee shall maintain in a readily accessible place all such records for a minimum of four (4) years after any payment period that such record pertains to. This right shall be in addition to the city’s right to conduct any other audit.

F.    In the event that any franchise fee payment is not paid by the due date, interest shall be charged monthly at a monthly rate of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%). In addition, if any franchise fee is not paid in full within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the city as to the delinquency of such payment, a late fee in the amount of five percent (5%) of the delinquent amount shall be assessed.

G.    In the event grantee claims to have overpaid by more than five percent (5%) the amount of franchise fee actually due during any given quarter, it shall file an application with the city within one year after said payment was made. The failure to timely and properly make such claim shall constitute a waiver by grantee of any right to such claimed overpayment, whether by refund, offset, credit or any other accommodation. All such applications shall state the amount of claimed overpayment, the reason for the claimed overpayment, and sufficient documentation to allow the city to verify grantee’s claim. Upon request by the city, grantee shall provide any further information that is deemed relevant by the city. All such applications shall be considered by the city council, and the city council’s decision with respect to such applications shall be final. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)

A.    Grantee’s providing the service to units of the facility on such terms and conditions as are reasonable, provided that: 1) the owner of the facility shall not seek to charge grantee any fee or consideration for access to the facility or for the right of providing cable service to the dwelling units within the facility, 2) grantee shall not seek to charge the owner of the facility any fee or consideration for installing such service other than its actual costs as provided for herein, and 3) such terms and conditions shall be in compliance with applicable law;

B.    Reasonable access to the premises by grantee for installation, maintenance, and inspection of the system on the premises;

C.    Reasonable conditions promulgated by grantee to protect grantee’s equipment and to encourage widespread use of the system;

D.    The owner shall not discriminate in rental charges, or otherwise, between tenants who receive cable service and those who do not; and

E.    The owner shall provide all easements, rights of way, and other rights of access deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate by grantee for purposes of providing cable television service to the facility. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)


§1916 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY

A.    Subscribers shall have the right to continue to receive service so long as their financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. Grantee shall at all times, and under all conditions, to the greatest extent economically and technically possible, maintain continuity of service. In the event of an assignment of the cable system, the assignor shall cooperate with the city and the assignee in order to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers.

B.    In the event grantee wilfully fails to operate the cable system for a period of five (5) consecutive days without prior approval of the city, the city may, in its sole discretion, elect to operate the cable system or designate an operator until grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city, or until the city selects a permanent operator. During the entire period while the city operates the cable system on behalf of grantee, or causes another party to do so, the city shall be entitled to collect any and all revenues from the operation of the cable system, and grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by the city that are caused by grantee’s failure to perform. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)

Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application filed under section 1918 of this article that is deemed to be complete, the city manager will give written notice to the applicant of the city’s intent to negotiate an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to the applicant. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)


§1920 AGREEMENT REQUIRED FOR OPEN VIDEO SYSTEM

A.    No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written agreement, which may be designated as a franchise, setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city.

B.    The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted by federal statute or regulations:

1. The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or extension.

2. The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city, at specified times, fees on the gross revenue received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR section 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and procedures:

a. The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be five percent (5%), and will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees authorized under section 622 of the communications act.

b. The term "OVS gross revenue" means: 1) all gross revenue received by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenue received from subscribers and all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video programming providers; and 2) all advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The term "OVS gross revenue" does not include revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers.

3. The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to information collection and record keeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the OVS gross revenue that are required to be paid as specified in subsection B2 of this section.

4. The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city’s requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR section 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are applicable:

a. The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational, and governmental access channel requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.

b. The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public, educational, and government access channels within the franchise service area in which the city’s subscribers are located.

c. The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to establish the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and government access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment. These negotiations may include the city’s franchised cable operator if the city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire.

d. If the open video system operator and the city are unable to reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and government access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment within the city’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be imposed:

(1) The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational, and government access channel obligations as the city’s franchised cable operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, educational, and governmental access and by matching the city’s franchised cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of public, educational, and government access services, facilities, and equipment that are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city’s franchised cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator’s depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under section 611 of the communications act.

(2) The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity designated for public, educational, and government access channel use when that capacity is not being used for such purposes.

e. The city’s franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public, educational, and government access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city may require that the connection occur on city owned property or on public rights of way.

f. All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s public, educational, and government access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video system operator’s matching financial contributions set forth in subsection B4d(1) of this section.

g. The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational, or government access channel obligations that are greater than those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.

h. If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR section 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator.

i. The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply with new public, education, and access channel obligations imposed on the city’s franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open video system to accommodate public, educational, and government access channels. The open video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and government access channel obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity.

5. If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s obligations to provide public, educational, and government access channel under the provisions of subsection B4 of this section, then either party may file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47 CFR section 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the dispute has been finally resolved.

6. If the open video system operator intends to maintain an institutional network, as defined in section 611(f) of the communications act, the city will require that educational and government access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels are designated on the institutional network of the city’s franchised cable operator. In addition, to the extent authorized by federal law, the open video system operator may be required by the city to satisfy the same financial obligations and other requirements that are imposed upon the franchised cable operator to support data transmission and related services that are provided by the institutional network.

7. The authority of an open video system provider to exercise editorial control over any public, educational, or government use of channel capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR section 76.1505(f).

8. The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, and regulations relating to customer service standards, including the cable television and video customer service and information act (Government Code section 53054 et seq.), the video customer service act (Government Code section 53088 et seq.), and sections 1902 through 1907 of this article.

9. If a new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the following rights of way use and management responsibilities that are also imposed by the city upon other telecommunications service providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:

a. Compliance with all applicable city codes, including applications for excavation, encroachment, and construction permits and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees.

b. The coordination of construction activities.

c. Compliance with established standards and procedures for constructing lines across private property.

d. Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification requirements.

e. The repair and resurfacing of construction damaged streets.

f. Compliance with all public safety requirements that are applicable to telecommunications service providers using public property or public rights of way.

10. Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation, or termination of the agreement.

11. Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the open video system.

12. Requirements relating to the open video system operator’s compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system.

13. Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies, and procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system operator and that will, in the judgment of the city council, best serve the public interest and protect the public health, welfare, and safety. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)


§1921 OTHER MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS

A.    The term "cable system", does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using any public rights of way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be "cable systems" and are therefore exempt from the city’s franchise requirements and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the use of the city’s public rights of way.

B.    Multichannel multipoint distribution service ("MMDS"), also known as "wireless cable", which typically involves the transmission by an FCC licensed operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line of sight technology.

C.    Local multipoint distribution service ("LMDS"), another form of over the air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and which offers video programming, telephone, and data networking services.

D.    Direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), also referred to as "direct to home satellite services", which involves the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber’s premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the subscriber’s premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local regulation of direct to home satellite services is further prescribed by the following federal statutory provisions:

1. 47 USC section 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct to home satellite services.

2. Section 602 of the communications act states that a provider of direct to home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct to home satellite service. The terms "tax" and "fee" are defined by federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any other tax, license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business, regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)

Video providers must provide an address and telephone number for a local subscriber to use without toll charge to prevent disclosure of the subscriber’s name and address.

D.    As authorized by California Government Code section 53088(q), the following schedule of penalties is adopted. These penalties may be imposed for the material breach by a video provider of the consumer protection and service standards that are set forth in subsection C of this section, provided that the breach is within the reasonable control of the video provider. These penalties are in addition to any other remedies authorized by this article or by any other law, and the city has discretion to elect the remedy that it will apply. The imposition of penalties authorized by this subsection will not prevent the city or any other affected party from exercising any other remedy to the extent permitted by law, including, but not limited to, any judicial remedy as provided by subsection D2 of this section.

1. Schedule Of Penalties:

a. For a first material breach: The maximum penalty is two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each day of material breach, but not to exceed a cumulative total of six hundred dollars ($600.00) for each occurrence of material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.

b. For a second material breach of the same nature for which a monetary penalty was previously assessed within the preceding twelve (12) month period: The maximum penalty is four hundred dollars ($400.00) per day, not to exceed a cumulative total of one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) for each occurrence of the material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.

d. For the failure of a video provider to distribute the annual notice required by California Government Code 53055.1: The maximum penalty is five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each year in which the notice is not distributed as required by state statute.

e. The maximum penalties referenced above may be increased by any additional amount authorized by state law.

2. Judicial Remedies Not Affected: The imposition of penalties in accordance with the provisions of subsection D1 of this section does not preclude any affected party from pursuing any judicial remedy that is available to that party.

3. Administration, Notice, And Appeal:

a. The city manager or the city manager’s designee is authorized to administer this subsection D. Decisions by the city manager to assess penalties against a video provider must be in writing and must contain findings supporting the decisions.

b. If the video provider or any interested person is aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, the aggrieved party may, within ten (10) days of the written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the city council. The appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the city council for processing the appeal. The city council may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the city manager.

c. The imposition of monetary penalties under subsection D1 of this section is subject to the following requirements and limitations:

(1) The city must give the video provider written notice of any alleged material breach and must allow the video provider at least thirty (30) days from receipt of that notice to remedy the breach.

(2) For the purpose of assessing monetary penalties, a material breach will be deemed to have occurred for each day, following the expiration of the period for cure specified in subsection D3c(1) of this section, that the material breach has not been remedied by the video provider, irrespective of the number of customers affected. (Ord. 1048, §1, adopted 2003)


§1923 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDED BY TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS

A.    The city council finds and determines as follows:

1. The federal telecommunications act of 1996 preempts and declares invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local and long distance telephone service.

2. The California public utilities commission ("CPUC") is primarily responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.

3. Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a "telephone corporation" as "every corporation or person owning, controlling, operating, or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state".

4. Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a telephone corporation "may condemn any property necessary for the construction and maintenance of its telephone line".

5. Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes municipal corporations to retain their powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationships between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health, convenience, and safety of the general public, including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility and the location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility on, under, or above any public streets.

6. Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes telephone and telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this state, and to erect poles, posts, piers, or abutments for supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines, in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.

7. Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the right of municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed, which control must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner, and may involve the imposition of fees.

8. Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any permit fee imposed by a city for the placement, installation, repair, or upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles, or antennas, by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and must not be levied for general revenue purposes.

B.    In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations and requirements set forth in subsection A of this section, the following regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to be constructed within the city’s public rights of way:

1. The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit ("ministerial permit").

2. In addition to the information required by this code in connection with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must submit to the city the following supplemental information:

a. A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city’s public rights of way.

b. If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of public convenience to operate as a "competitive local carrier", the following additional requirements are applicable:

(1) As required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the applicant must establish that it has filed with the city in a timely manner a quarterly report that describes the type of construction and the location of each construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar quarter in which the application is filed, which information is sufficient to enable the city to coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary.

(2) If the applicant’s proposed construction project will extend beyond the utility rights of way into undisturbed areas or other rights of way, the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed construction project has been subjected to a full scale environmental analysis by the CPUC, as required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.

(3) The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures specified in the negative declaration ("competitive local carriers (CLCs) projects for local exchange communication service throughout California") or to the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC. The city’s issuance of a ministerial permit will be conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with all applicable mitigation measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone corporations that are designated as "competitive local carriers".

C.    In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public rights of way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement, and for the purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the city, the following policies and procedures are adopted:

1. The city manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities, including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction, maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to, a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the public rights of way.

2. The city manager is directed to coordinate the construction and installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public rights of way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street construction or renovation projects, the city manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or "windows" for the installation of facilities within the public rights of way. Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly "window" that is established by the city.

3. Once the time has passed to contact the official designated under subsection D2 of this section the city may set off the amount owed under this section against any amounts the city owes the debtor.

§2351 LICENSE REQUIREMENTS

A.    It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this article for each location at which that activity is to occur. No license may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a fixed location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot and tobacco retailing from vehicles are prohibited.

B.    The term of a license is one year from January 1 through December 31 unless earlier suspended, terminated or revoked pursuant to section 2358 of this article. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer’s license no later than thirty (30) days prior to its expiration.

C.    Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city of Ukiah identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this article shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by Labor Code section 6404.5. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2352 APPLICATION PROCEDURE

Application for a tobacco retailer’s license shall be submitted in the name of each person proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each person or an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of each person to be informed of the laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a person may be revoked pursuant to section 2358 of this article. All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

A.    The name, address, and telephone number of each person.

B.    The business name, address, and telephone number of each location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought.

C.    The name and mailing address authorized by each person to receive all license related communications and notices (the "authorized address"). If an authorized address is not supplied, each person shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified pursuant to subsection B of this section.

D.    Whether or not any person has previously been issued a license pursuant to this article that is, or was at any time, suspended or revoked and, if so, the dates of the suspension period or the date of revocation.

E.    Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this article. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2353 ISSUANCE OF LICENSE

Upon the receipt of an application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the license fee, the department shall issue a license, unless:

A.    The application is incomplete or inaccurate; or

B.    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a person for which or whom a suspension is in effect pursuant to section 2358 of this article, or by a person which or who has had a license revoked pursuant to section 2358 of this article. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2354 DISPLAY OF LICENSE

Each license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed premises. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2355 LICENSE FEE

The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established by resolution of city council. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2356 LICENSES NOT TRANSFERABLE

A tobacco retailer’s license is not transferable. If the information required in the license application pursuant to subsection 2352A, B or C of this article changes, the tobacco retailer must notify the department within fourteen (14) days, and update all information on the license application form in order to continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a tobacco retailer to whom a license has been issued changes business location, that tobacco retailer must supply updated license information within fourteen (14) days of acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. If a business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting as a tobacco retailer. The current licensee shall notify the department of the sale of the tobacco retailing business. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2357 LICENSE VIOLATION

A.    Violation Of Tobacco Related Laws: It shall be a violation of a tobacco retailer’s license for a person or his or her agent or employee to violate any local, state, or federal tobacco related law.

B.    License Compliance Monitoring: The city of Ukiah anticipates that compliance checks of each tobacco retailer will be conducted at least two (2) times during each twelve (12) month period by the Mendocino County public health department. The city shall not enforce any tobacco related minimum age law against a person who otherwise would be in violation of such law because of the person’s age (hereinafter "youth decoy") if the violation occurs when:

1. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a law enforcement official, a code enforcement official, or any peace officer; or

2. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded or supervised in part by the county of Mendocino or, funded or supervised in any part by the California department of health services. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2358 SUSPENSION, TERMINATION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE

A.    Violation: In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer’s license may be suspended or revoked if the department determines that the person or his or her agents or employees have violated the requirements of this article or other conditions of the license imposed pursuant to section 2357 of this article. A person who loses his license for one location does not lose it for all locations, if those locations are in compliance with this article, and may renew licenses for other conforming locations. A person cannot obtain a new license for a new location so long as there is a suspension in effect for any location.

1. Notice Required: The licensee shall be served with written notice of all determinations or decisions under this section affecting his or her license. Notice shall be served by personal service, overnight courier, certified mail, return receipt requested, or U.S. mail with first class postage affixed. The notice shall be sent to the authorized address. All notices shall be deemed served, when received, except for notices sent by first class mail which shall be deemed served two (2) days after deposit in the U.S. mail if addressed to a location within Mendocino County and five (5) days if addressed to a location outside Mendocino County. The notice shall describe the legal and factual basis for the decision. A decision imposing a fine shall specify the amount of the fine. A decision to suspend or revoke a license shall specify the beginning and ending dates of the suspension or the effective date of the revocation. No decision shall become effective in less than ten (10) days from the date of service.

2. Duration Of Suspensions:

a. Upon a finding by the department of a first license violation within any thirty six (36) month period, the license shall be suspended for fourteen (14) days. However, prior to imposing the suspension, the department shall by letter (an "advice letter") advise the person that if person trains all sales employees at the location of the sale in the laws pertaining to the sale of tobacco products to minors and techniques to ensure future compliance with said laws, the suspension will not go into effect. Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the advice letter, the person must file with the department an affidavit signed by the person and the sales employees that said training has been completed. If the person fails to timely submit the affidavit, the department shall notify the person that the permit is suspended for fourteen (14) days.

b. Upon a finding by the department of a second license violation within any thirty six (36) month period, the license shall be suspended for twenty one (21) days.

c. Upon a finding by the department of a third license violation within any thirty six month (36) period, the license shall be suspended for thirty (30) days.

d. Upon a finding by the department of a fourth license violation within any thirty six (36) month period, the license shall be revoked and the person or persons who had been issued the license shall not be issued a tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this article for a period of three (3) years from the date of revocation.

B.    Failure To Pay Renewal Fees: A tobacco retailer’s license which is not timely renewed pursuant to subsection 2352B of this article is an expired license. The tobacco retailer shall not engage in tobacco retailing at the licensed location until a new license has been issued for that location.

C.    License Issued In Error: A tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if the department determines that one or more of the bases for denial of a license under section 2353 of this article existed at the time application was made or at any time before the license issued. The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new application for a license.

D.    Removal Of All Tobacco Products From Public View: A tobacco retailer whose license is suspended must remove from public view all tobacco products and tobacco advertising for the duration of the suspension. Failure to remove such items from view will be regarded as a violation of this article equivalent to that of selling to minors.

E.    License Obtained Under False Pretenses: Tobacco retailers whose license is obtained under false pretenses shall have that license revoked. A licensee whose license is revoked pursuant to this subsection may not apply for a new license for a period of one year from the date the license is revoked. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2359 ADMINISTRATIVE FINE

A.    Grounds For Fine: If the department determines that any unlicensed person, including a person named on a revoked or suspended license, has engaged in tobacco retailing in violation of this article, the department shall fine that person as follows:

1. A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation in any thirty six (36) month period; or

2. A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second violation in any thirty six (36) month period; or

3. A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a third or subsequent violation in any thirty six (36) month period.

Each day that such a person engages in tobacco retailing shall constitute a separate violation.

B.    Imposition Of Fine: If no request for a hearing is timely received in accordance with section 2360 of this article, the department’s determination on the violation and the imposition of a fine shall be final and payment shall be made within thirty (30) days after notice of the fine was served in accordance with subsection 2358A1 of this article. If the fine is not paid within that time, the fine may be collected, along with interest at the legal rate, in any manner provided by law. In the event that a judicial action is necessary to compel payment of the fine and accumulated interest, the person or persons subject to the fine shall also be liable for the costs of the suit and attorney fees incurred by the city in collecting the fine. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2360 GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE

A.    Appeal Of Fine, Suspension Or Revocation: A decision of the department to impose a fine or to revoke or suspend a license may be appealed to the grievance committee. The appellant must file a written notice of appeal with the department within ten (10) days after service of the notice of the decision. Failure to file a timely notice of appeal waives any right to further challenge the department’s decision. "File" means delivered to the city manager’s office in the Ukiah Civic Center at 300 Seminary Ave., Ukiah, California. The filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the department’s decision, until the grievance committee has served its final decision on the appeal. The committee may reverse, modify or uphold the department’s decision.

B.    Notice Of Hearing: If a notice of appeal is timely filed, the department shall provide written notice to the appellant of the date, time, and place of the hearing in the manner specified in subsection 2358A1 of this article. A hearing may not be conducted less than twenty (20) days after notice is given to the appellant.

C.    Hearing: The grievance committee may adopt rules governing the conduct of its hearings. Those rules shall include, at least, the following:

1. The department shall submit evidence at the hearing substantiating its decision. Such evidence may include testimony, police or other reports of the incident, witness statements and other documents. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the department must notify the appellant of the name, address and phone number of any witness to the violation, and furnish appellant with a copy of any document it intends to submit at the hearing. Not less than seven (7) days prior to the hearing, the appellant may request the department to produce at the hearing any witness the department intends to rely upon to substantiate the violation. The written request must name the witness or witnesses who are requested to attend the hearing. The department may not rely on the testimony of any witness (including such testimony contained in reports or written witness statements) whose appearance at the hearing is required by this subsection, if that witness fails to appear.

2. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing, the appellant must notify the department in writing of the name, address and phone number of any witness the appellant intends to call as a witness at the hearing, provide a brief description of the proposed testimony, and furnish the department with a copy of any document the appellant intends to offer as evidence at the hearing. The appellant may not call any witness to testify at the hearing who was not identified as required by this subsection or offer any document as evidence at the hearing that was not provided to the department as required by this subsection.

3. At the hearing, the appellant may be represented by an attorney, at appellant’s expense. Both the department and the appellant shall have the right to examine and cross examine any witness produced at the hearing. The rules of evidence that normally apply in court shall not apply in a hearing before the committee, but the grievance committee shall only consider evidence which would be relied upon by reasonable people making an important decision, and shall disregard evidence which by its nature is unreliable or not credible.

4. The entire hearing shall be electronically or stenographically recorded. The grievance committee shall base its decision exclusively on the evidence presented at the hearing and shall issue a written decision, which includes a statement of the relevant facts which the committee finds to be true and explains how the facts support its decision. For example, if the department finds that the appellant sold cigarettes to a minor, but this was the first violation committed by the appellant within thirty six (36) months, the decision would explain that subsection 2358A2a of this article requires a fourteen (14) day suspension of the appellant’s license to sell tobacco products at the licensed location, and on that basis the facts support a fourteen (14) day suspension of the license for that location. The record of the hearing shall be preserved for not less than six (6) months after the decision is served on the appellant.

D.    Hearing Decision: The chairperson of the grievance committee shall issue the written decision required by subsection C4 of this section. Copies of the decision shall be served in accordance with subsection 2358A1 of this article. The hearing decision shall include notice of the appellant’s right to seek review of the decision pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1094.6, including the statute of limitations for seeking review pursuant to section 1094.6.

E.    Finality Of The Grievance Committee’s Decision: The decision of the grievance committee shall be the final decision for the city of Ukiah.

F.    Appeal To Superior Court: Judicial review of the grievance committee’s decision shall be governed by the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1094.6.

G.    Enforcement Of Decision: Unless stayed by a court, any final decision of the grievance committee is effective immediately and may be implemented and enforced by the department. (Ord. 1072, §2, adopted 2005)


§2361 ENFORCEMENT

1. The Department shall review the application in light of its conformity with applicable provisions of this article and shall issue a permit on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, subject to the following requirements:

a. Within ten (10) days of receiving an application, the Department must determine and notify the applicant whether the application is complete; or if an application is incomplete, the Department must specifically identify the missing information, and may toll the approval interval in subsection A1b of this section. The applicant may resubmit the completed application within twenty (20) days without additional charge, and the subsequent review will be limited to the specifically identified missing information subsequently completed, except to the extent material changes to the proposed facility have been made by the applicant (other than those requested or required by the Department) in which case a new application and application fee for same must be submitted. 

b. The Department must make its final decision to approve or deny the application within sixty (60) days for a collocation, and ninety (90) days for any new structure, after the application is complete (or deemed complete).The Department must advise the applicant in writing of its final decision, and in the final decision document the basis for a denial, including specific code provisions and/or regulations on which the denial was based. A decision to deny an application shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record, publicly available, and sent to the applicant. The written decision, supported by such substantial evidence, shall constitute final action by City. The review period or "shot clock" shall continue to run until the written decision, supported by substantial evidence, is made publicly available and sent to the applicant. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days of the denial without paying an additional application fee unless denial was issued due to noncompliance with design guidelines or other requirements under section 2401 of this code, in which case a new application fee must be paid. 

c. The City shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days of receipt of the revised application. The subsequent review by the City shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the original denial and any material changes to the application made to cure any identified deficiencies.

2. If the City fails to act on an application within the review period referenced in subsection A1b of this section, the applicant may provide the City written notice that the time period for acting has lapsed, and the City then has twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice within which to render its written decision, failing which the application is then deemed approved by passage of time and operation of law and a permit shall be deemed issued for such application. Applicant shall provide written notice to the City at least seven (7) days prior to beginning construction or collocation pursuant to the de facto permit issued under this subsection, and such notice shall not be construed as an additional opportunity for objection by the City or other entity to the deployment.

3. An applicant seeking to construct, modify or replace a network of communications facilities may, at the applicant’s discretion and subject to the City’s batch application requirements and process under section 2401.7 of this code, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for multiple communications facilities, or multiple permits. The City’s denial of any site or sites within a consolidated application shall not delay or affect other sites submitted in the same application. The City shall grant a permit(s) for any and all sites in a consolidated application that it does not otherwise deny, subject to the requirements of this section.

B.    Review Of Eligible Facilities Requests: Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the City shall approve within sixty (60) days and may not deny applications for eligible facilities requests according to the procedures established under 47 CFR section 1.6100(c).2

C.    Small Wireless Facilities; Maximum Height; Other Requirements:

1. Maximum Size Of Permitted Use: Small wireless facilities, and new, modified or replacement poles, towers and support structures (subject to the further limitation for replacement of support structures described in subsection 2400.2AA of this code) to be used for collocation of small wireless facilities may be placed in the public right-of-way as a permitted use in accordance with this subsection, subject to the following requirements:

a. New poles, but not new towers, may be installed in the public ROW as long as their installation facilitates the extension of existing pole lines or does not result in the creation of parallel paths of poles or exceed the greater of: 

(1) Five feet (5') above the tallest existing pole, tower, or support structure not exceeding fifty feet (50') in the public ROW, in place as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article, and located within five hundred feet (500') of the new proposed pole, tower, or support structure; or ten feet (10') on utility distribution poles where required by the electrical utility separation requirements; or

(2) Fifty feet (50') above ground level.

2. Each modified or replacement pole, tower, or support structure installed in the public ROW shall not exceed the greater of:

a. Five feet (5') above the height of the pole, tower or support structure being modified or replaced in place as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article; or ten feet (10') on utility distribution poles where required by the electrical utility separation requirements; or

b. The height limit under subsection C1a of this section.

3. Division 3, Chapter 9 of this code shall apply to all new poles and modified or replacement poles, towers, or support structures.

D.    Discretionary Review Requirements: Unless an applicant seeks to install a communications facility that conforms to the specific uses and size and height limitations set forth in section 2401.2A of this code (or involves ordinary maintenance, repair and replacement), the application shall require a minor use permit under section 9262 of this code.

E.    Undergrounding Provisions: The City shall administer undergrounding provisions in a nondiscriminatory manner.

1. Underground Districts: The provisions in Division 4, Chapter 3 of this code, governing the creation of underground utility districts in the City shall apply with full force and effect to wireless facilities, wireless service providers and wireless providers, provided compliance by the wireless facilities or wireless service providers does not discriminate against or unduly inhibit or prevent them from providing wireless services. An applicant shall comply with nondiscriminatory City undergrounding requirements, including requirements that apply in existing underground utility districts or in districts established after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article. "Unduly inhibit" does not include increased costs to comply with undergrounding requirements that are imposed on other utilities and property owners in such districts.

2. Outside Underground Districts: Outside established underground districts now established or established in the future the City may require relocation without expense to City of any poles, wires, conduits and appurtenances theretofore installed, in accordance with subsection G of this section. In areas where existing aerial utilities are being moved underground, wireless providers shall be required at their own expense to move their wireless facilities to another pole, if the undergrounding requires the removal of the pole used by those wireless facilities. The City shall make available for the use of said wireless facilities any City-owned pole or street light pole in a suitable location which can accommodate said wireless facilities. No additional fees shall be imposed in connection with said relocation, but applicable make-ready, annual ROW and occupancy, and attachment fees pursuant to subsections 2401.1B2 through 4 of this code shall continue to apply. To the degree such vertical structures are not available, the applicant must apply for a minor use permit pursuant to section 9262 of this code to install new poles.

F.    Effect Of Permit:

1. Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A permit from the City authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the public ROW.

2. Duration: Any permit for construction issued under section 2401 of this code shall be valid for a period of six (6) months after issuance during which the construction must be completed; provided, that the six (6) month period shall be extended for up to an additional six (6) months upon written request of the applicant (made prior to the end of the initial six (6) month period) if the failure to complete construction is delayed as a result of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the applicant.

G.    Removal, Relocation Or Modification Of A Communications Facility In The ROW:

1. Notice: Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the City, a provider shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any communications facility within the public ROW whenever the City has determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any City improvement in or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon, the public ROW. The City shall apply the same standards to all utilities in the public ROW.

2. Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The City retains the right and privilege to cut power to or move any communications facility located within the public ROW of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public welfare emergency or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the City shall notify the provider and provide the provider an opportunity to move its own facilities prior to cutting power to or removing the communications facility and in all cases shall notify the provider after cutting power to or removing the communications facility as promptly as reasonably possible. The provider shall pay the City its costs necessarily incurred to move the communications facility within sixty (60) days of receiving a written statement from the City detailing the costs.

3. Abandonment Of Facilities: A provider is required to notify the City of abandonment of any communications facility at the time the decision to abandon is made; however, in no case shall such notification be made later than thirty (30) days prior to abandonment. Following receipt of such notice, the City shall direct the provider to remove all or any portion of the communications facility if the City determines that such removal will be in the best interest of public safety and public welfare. If the provider fails to remove the abandoned facility within sixty (60) days after such notice, the City may undertake to do so and recover the actual expenses of doing so from the provider, its successors and/or assigns.

4. Structural Reconditioning, Repair And Replacement: From time to time, the City may paint, recondition, or otherwise improve or repair the City poles in a substantial way ("reconditioning work"). The provider shall reasonably cooperate with the City to carry out reconditioning work activities in a manner that minimizes interference with the provider’s approved use of the facility.

a. Prior to commencing reconditioning work, the City will use reasonable efforts to provide the provider with at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice. Upon receiving that notice, it shall be the provider’s sole responsibility to provide adequate measures to cover, remove, or otherwise protect the provider’s communications facility from the consequences of the reconditioning work, including but not limited to paint and debris fallout. The City reserves the right to require the provider to remove all of the provider’s communications facility from the City pole and surrounding premises during reconditioning work, provided the requirement to remove same is contained in the written notice required by this subsection. All costs associated with the protection measures, including temporary removal, shall be the sole responsibility of the provider. If the City fails in good faith to give at least sixty (60) days’ notice, it will not affect the City’s rights under this subsection. In all cases, as much notice as possible should be provided, but in no case less than thirty (30) days’ notice shall be provided. The City will provide the provider with a date by which its equipment must be protected or removed.

b. The provider may request a modification of the City procedures for carrying out reconditioning work in order to reduce the interference with provider’s operation of its communications facility. If the City agrees to the modification, the provider shall be responsible for all reasonable incremental cost related to the modification.

c. If the City poles need to be replaced ("replacement work"), the City shall give provider at least sixty (60) days’ written notice to remove its communications facilities. The City shall also promptly notify provider when the City poles have been replaced and provider may reinstall its equipment. During the replacement work, the provider may maintain a temporary communications facility on the property, or after approval by City on any land owned or controlled by City in the vicinity of the property. If the property will not accommodate the provider’s temporary communications facility or if the parties cannot agree on a temporary location, the provider, at its sole option, shall have the right to suspend the applicable permit, until the replacement pole is installed, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the City.

d. If the City poles need to be repaired due to storm or other damage ("repair work"), the City shall notify the provider to remove its communications facilities as soon as possible. In the event of an emergency, the City shall contact the provider by telephone at its emergency contact of record upon or prior to removing the provider’s equipment. Once the City poles have been replaced or repaired, the City will promptly notify the provider that it can reinstall its equipment. During City repair work, with the approval of the City which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the provider may maintain a temporary communications facility on the property, or after approval by City, on any land owned or controlled by the City in the vicinity of the property that the City determines is suitable for that use. All cost associated with any removal or protection of communications facilities shall be the sole responsibility of the provider without prejudice to the provider’s right to seek indemnity or contribution from third parties other than the City.

H.    Attachment To City Poles In The Public ROW:

1. Make-Ready: For any attachment to City poles in the public ROW, except as otherwise provided in the agreement required by subsection 2401.1A of this code, the City shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the City pole to support the proposed facility, including replacement of the pole if necessary, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a completed application requesting attachment to the City pole. Make-ready work including any pole replacement shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the provider. Such acceptance shall be signified by payment via check or other commercially reasonable and customary means specified by the City. (Ord. 1194, §1, adopted 2019)


§2401.4 APPLICATIONS REQUIRING DISCRETIONARY REVIEW AND APPROVAL

A.    Discretionary Review Required: All other uses not expressly set forth or referenced in subsection 2401.2A of this code shall require compliance with and issuance of a minor use permit pursuant to section 9262 of this code. (Ord. 1194, §1, adopted 2019)


§2401.5 OTHER PUBLIC ROW INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

A.    General Principles.

1. The City shall have the power to establish reasonable and nondiscriminatory limitations on the placement of new or additional facilities within specific congested segments of the public ROW if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of applicants or other persons to occupy and use the public ROW. In making such decisions, the City shall to the extent possible accommodate all existing users and potential users (i.e., those who have submitted an application to deploy facilities within the public ROW) of the public ROW, and shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the width and physical condition of the public ROW, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities and uses in the public ROW and established plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public’s interest.

2. Leasing of excess space in ducts, conduits and on a pole is a matter between interested parties (subject to any applicable pole attachment regulations and any other applicable statutory, regulatory or contractual obligations); however, lessees or licensees of such physical facilities must still comply with the terms of this article, unless otherwise expressly exempted by the City.

3. An occupant of the public ROW shall employ due care during the installation and maintenance process, and comply with all safety and public ROW-protection requirements of applicable Federal, State and local laws (and any generally applicable City guidelines, standards and   practices), and any additional commonly accepted safety and public ROW-protection standards, methods and devices (to the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws). All facilities under the streets of the City shall be kept and maintained in a safe and well-ordered condition, and in good order and repair.

a. Any permittee occupying any portion of the public ROW shall erect a barrier around the perimeter of any excavation and provide any and all traffic-control devices, signs and lights appropriate to the level of complexity of the activity in order to protect, warn and guide the public (vehicular and pedestrian) through the work zone. The manner and use of these devices shall be described within a traffic-control plan in accordance with the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices.

b. Occupants of the public ROW with open excavations awaiting final restoration shall maintain all devices until the City notifies the occupant in writing that the City or the City’s designated contractor is assuming responsibility for traffic control.

c. Each occupant shall designate a safety officer. The safety officer shall be responsible for safety-related issues affecting both the public and the occupant’s field employees and contractors for all job sites within the public ROW.

4. Location Of Existing Facilities:

a. An occupant of the public ROW shall not place any fixtures or equipment where the same will interfere with any existing facility, and shall locate its lines and equipment in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual traffic patterns (vehicular or pedestrian) or with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property that abuts any public ROW.

b. To minimize disruption of public passage or infrastructure, to forestall or relieve overcrowding of the public ROW, or to protect historic property or environmentally sensitive areas, the City may require, as a condition of issuing any permit for placement of underground facilities or new applicant poles, that the occupant place empty conduits, and/or reserve space on a new applicant pole in excess of its own present and reasonably foreseeable requirements, for the purpose of accommodating the City’s own present or reasonably foreseeable governmental, not-for-resale use as set forth in the applicable permit. The occupant shall cooperate with the City in any such construction; provided, that the City has first notified the occupant in writing that it is interested in reserving such pole space or sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the construction is occurring.

The occupant shall allow the City to place its infrastructure in the occupant’s trenches or bores or on the pole as requested by the City; provided, that the City incurs the incremental costs of placing the conduit/infrastructure as requested. The City shall be responsible for maintaining its facilities in the trenches and bores and/or on the pole under this subsection.

c. Before beginning excavation in any public ROW, an occupant shall comply with underground service alert notification procedures to determine possible conflicts with existing underground structures and facilities in the area to be excavated.

5. Relocation Of Existing Facilities:

a. If relocation of facilities is required as a result of any public project, the City shall provide the greatest practical advance notice to the affected occupants of the public ROW and shall facilitate the greatest reasonable project coordination among the affected occupants, whereas coordinated sequencing dependencies are common. Generally, projects of greater scale and scope will have a longer planning horizon, and commensurate notice.

b. The objective of the relocation process recognizes the mutual obligations and responsibilities of the City and the public ROW occupants to avoid or minimize service disruption and to timely and economically complete the public project. Public ROW occupants are obligated to proceed with diligent speed and attention so as not to unreasonably delay or complicate a public project.

c. As general guidance, projects involving a public project of less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), or ten (10) utility poles, or one thousand (1,000) frontage feet of public roadway would be smaller projects; and projects greater than any of the above would be larger projects. A reasonable, general expectation is that smaller projects would provide ninety (90) days’ notice, and larger projects would provide one hundred eighty (180) days’ notice to complete the relocation of the public ROW occupants.

d. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the occupant, at no cost to the City, shall accomplish the necessary relocation within a reasonable time from the date of the notification, but, in no event, later than seven (7) days prior to the date the City has notified the occupant that it intends to commence work which requires the occupant’s relocation, or immediately in the case of emergencies. With as much notice as possible, except for emergencies, no less than ninety (90) days following written notice from the City, a provider shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any communications facility.

e. The City will use its best efforts to accommodate the provider’s request for relocation of the communications facility, whenever the City has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration of facilities within the public ROW is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any City improvement in or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon, the public ROW.

f. The City may not require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the communications facility or support structure for which approval is sought, or to provide in-kind contributions, except for reserving pole space or placing conduit in the trench or bore for governmental, not-for-resale City use as provided in subsection A4b of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant may offer in-kind contributions related to the communications facility or support structure for which approval is sought, on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis, including by contributing the cash value of an in-kind contribution already provided by another party.

6. In the event of an emergency where any communications facility in the public ROW creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the City may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of such communications facility, and charge the occupant for actual and reasonable costs incurred. The City shall use a provider’s emergency contact information of record, or best available contact information, for prior notice, and if not possible because of emergent and imminent danger, shall notify the occupant promptly afterwards. Ten (10) days after notification as outlined in this subsection, the City may remove any communications facilities that obstruct the progress of a public project. all costs associated with any removal or protection of communications equipment shall be the sole responsibility of the provider.

7. Abandonment Of Facilities:

a. Any occupant of the public ROW that intends to permanently discontinue use of any facilities within the public ROW shall notify the City in writing within thirty (30) days prior to abandonment. Such notice shall describe the facilities for which the use is to be discontinued and the date of discontinuance of use. Upon notification, the City will choose from the following options within thirty (30) days or any other agreed upon option, and so notify the occupant of its decision:

(1) Abandon the facilities in place and the occupant shall further convey full title and ownership of such abandoned facilities to the City. The occupant is responsible for all obligations of the facilities, or other associated liabilities, until the conveyance to the City is completed; or

(2) The facilities shall be removed, and the occupant shall be liable for removing the facilities at its own cost. If an occupant fails to remove facilities that the City requires it to remove, after ninety (90) days’ notice to the occupant the City may perform the work. The occupant or its successors and/or assigns shall pay the City the costs of removal within thirty (30) days after the City provides a written statement detailing the costs. 

B.    Additional Requirements:

1. General: All deployments of communications facilities in the public ROW shall comply with the following:

a. Compliance with ADA and other applicable Federal, State and local laws and standards.

b. Pedestrian and vehicular traffic and safety requirements established by the City.

c. Existing public ROW occupancy or management ordinances, not otherwise inconsistent with this article.

2. Design Standards: All aboveground communications facilities in the public ROW requiring administrative review only shall conform to the Aesthetic Guidelines for Wireless Telecommunication Facilities adopted by resolution by the City as required by section 2390 of this code.

3. Additional Permits: In addition to obtaining a permit for installation of a communications facility in the public ROW, an applicant must enter the agreement in Attachment A and obtain the following additional permits: encroachment permit and applicable permits under section 3000 of this code.

4. Placement Of Facilities: The City Engineer may assign specific corridors within the public ROW for each type of communication facility as he determines may be necessary for each type of facility that is or may be located in the public ROW. In making these assignments the City Engineer shall consider facility types that currently exist or which, based on current technology, may be located within the public ROW in the future. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the City Engineer involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities.

C.    Mapping Data: Applicants shall provide to the City Engineer information indicating the horizontal and approximate vertical location, relative to the boundaries of the public ROW, of all equipment which it owns or over which it has control, and which is located in any public ROW.

(Ord. 1194, §1, adopted 2019)1

(7) Substantial Change. A modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria:

    (i) For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than 10% or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than 10% or more than ten feet, whichever is greater;

    (A) Changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act;

    (ii) For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet;

    (iii) For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than 10% larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure;

    (iv) It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;

    (v) It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or

    (vi) It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in § 1.6100(b)(7)(i) through (iv). 2

Review of applications. A State or local government may not deny and shall approve any eligible facilities request for modification of an eligible support structure that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such structure.

(1) Documentation requirement for review. When an applicant asserts in writing that a request for modification is covered by this section, a State or local government may require the applicant to provide documentation or information only to the extent reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of this section. A State or local government may not require an applicant to submit any other documentation, including but not limited to documentation intended to illustrate the need for such wireless facilities or to justify the business decision to modify such wireless facilities.

    (2) Timeframe for review. Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits a request seeking approval under this section, the State or local government shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section.

    (3) Tolling Of The Time Frame For Review. The 60-day period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement or in cases where the reviewing State or local government determines that the application is incomplete. The time frame for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.

    (i) To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the reviewing State or local government must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Such delineated information is limited to documents or information meeting the standard under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    (ii) The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the State or local government's notice of incompleteness.

    (iii) Following a supplemental submission, the State or local government will have 10 days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this paragraph (c)(3). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.

    (4) Failure to act. In the event the reviewing State or local government fails to approve or deny a request seeking approval under this section within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the applicable reviewing authority in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.

    (5) Remedies. Applicants and reviewing authorities may bring claims related to Section 6409(a) to any court of competent jurisdiction.

§2581 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF BADGE3

A.    Immediate Suspension or Revocation: The Director of Public Safety may immediately suspend or revoke a driver’s badge on any of the following grounds:

1. A suspension or revocation of his or her driver’s license;

2. The driver caused a motor vehicle accident causing more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) in property damage or bodily injury or death;

If the driver was subject to a test meeting the requirements of this section within a period of one year from the date of recertification as part of a driver recertification program in another California city or county, the test from that other jurisdiction will satisfy the requirements of this subsection, unless the earlier test yielded a positive test result.

In the event of an immediate suspension or revocation under this subsection A the Director of Public Safety shall immediately provide the notice and opportunity for a hearing provided in subsection C of this section, except that the suspension or revocation shall remain in effect unless or until reversed by decision of the Hearing Officer. It shall be unlawful and constitute a violation of this chapter for any driver to operate a for hire motor vehicle after notice of the suspension or revocation has been given.

B.    Suspension or Revocation with Opportunity for Prior Notice and Opportunity for a Hearing: The Director of Public Safety may suspend or revoke a driver’s badge with prior notice and opportunity for a hearing based on any of the following grounds:

2. Any of the grounds for denying a badge as stated in section 2580 of this code;

3. Any violation of any provision of this chapter; or

4. Any act which tends to endanger the public health or safety, if the driver is allowed to continue operating a vehicle for which a driver’s badge is required.

C.    Procedure: Five (5) working days prior to the effective date of the suspension or revocation under subsection B of this section, the Director of Public Safety shall serve a copy of a notice of suspension or revocation on the badge holder. The notice shall be personally served or sent by first class mail to the address on file with the Director of Public Safety. The notice shall be deemed served when personally delivered to the badge holder or when deposited in the United States mail. The notice shall state the grounds for the suspension or revocation, the facts supporting the decision and the dates when the suspension will begin and end or the effective date of revocation. The notice shall inform the badge holder that the decision will not become effective if he or she files with the Director of Public Safety an appeal of the decision prior to the effective date. The badge holder has no right of appeal unless he or she files the request for an appeal prior to the effective date of the suspension or revocation. The Hearing Officer shall hear the appeal in accordance with section 2534 of this code. After hearing the appeal, the Hearing Officer may suspend, revoke or impose conditions on the use of the badge and shall specify the effective dates of the suspension, revocation or conditions.

§2717:    Violation


§2700 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

A.    The state of California has recognized, by the adoption of special legislation regulating tenancies of mobilehome owners in mobilehome parks, that there is a significant distinction between homeowners in mobilehome parks and other dwelling units, and the state likewise has recognized that homeowners in mobilehome parks, unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock, are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a residence, the space for which is rented or leased as distinguished from owned.

The physical removal and relocation of a mobilehome from a rented or leased space within a mobilehome park can be accomplished only at substantial cost and inconvenience with a limited concurrent ability to find another location and, in many instances, the removal requires a separation of the mobilehome unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent, thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobilehome.

Because of the limited availability of vacant spaces in mobilehome parks, the age and condition of some mobilehomes and the cost of moving mobilehomes, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to move a mobilehome from one park to another within the city.

B.    There is presently within the city and the surrounding areas a shortage of sites for the placement of mobilehomes.

C.    According to the Ukiah general plan housing element, mobilehomes presently constitute an important source of housing for persons of extremely low, very low, low, and moderate income levels, who as a group are unable to afford unreasonably large rent increases.

D.    A large number of persons living in mobilehomes are elderly, some of whom live on small fixed incomes. These persons may expend a substantial portion of their income on rent and may not be able to afford other housing within the city.

E.    Rents for sites within mobilehome parks in the city have, prior to the adoption of this chapter, increased substantially, with recent increases in one park exceeding by a substantial amount the annual increase in the cost of living.

F.    Space rent increases at the time of sale or other transfer of a mobilehome within a park have been shown to be substantially over the pretransfer rent. Such large rent increases at the time of sale of a mobilehome may unfairly depress the sales price of the mobilehome and work an economic hardship on the mobilehome owner. The annual rent increases and vacancy control provisions of this chapter prevent this economic hardship while protecting the property rights of owners.

G.    Because of the space shortage and potential for rapidly rising rents, regulation is necessary to assure that economic hardship to a substantial number of mobilehome owners in the city, many of whom are senior citizens on low fixed incomes, does not occur.

H.    It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a speedy and efficient method of reviewing certain requested mobilehome space rent increases in mobilehome parks to protect mobilehome owners from arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable site rent adjustments while ensuring owners and/or operators and investors a fair and reasonable return on their investment in their mobilehome park. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2701 DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of this chapter, the following words, terms and phrases shall be defined as follows:

A. Licensed attorney or CPA who is qualified by experience or training to conduct the arbitrations authorized by this chapter.

B. Membership in the American Arbitration Association with expertise in rental dispute arbitration; or

C. Service as a judge in a state or federal court.

§2702 BASE RENT

Except as provided in this chapter, an owner shall not demand, accept or retain rent for a mobilehome space exceeding the base rent which shall be the rent in effect for that space on November 19, 2010. If a previously rented mobilehome space was not rented on November 19, 2010, the base rent shall not exceed the rent in effect during the last month the space was rented prior to November 19, 2010, except as provided in this chapter. For a mobilehome space first rented after November 19, 2010, the owner shall establish the base rent. For parks annexed into the city after November 19, 2010, the base rent shall be the rent charged on the effective date of a park’s annexation into the city. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2703 CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, UTILITIES AND OTHER PASS-THROUGHS

A.    Consumer Price Index: An owner, once in any twelve (12) month period, may impose a rent increase for a mobilehome space by one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase, if any, in the consumer price index (CPI) during the most recent twelve (12) month period ending in October; provided, however, the rental increase shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the previous rent charged for the space. If an owner has obtained a rent increase under subsection 2704B of this chapter, the owner may calculate the rent increase allowed by this subsection based upon the approved comparable rent as allowed in subsection 2704B of this chapter instead of upon the actual rent in effect at the time of the increase.

B.    Review; Amendment: If the change in the CPI exceeds five percent (5%) for two (2) consecutive years, the clerk shall review the maximum rent increase and recommend an ordinance amendment if appropriate.

C.    Government Mandated Expense Pass-Through: An owner may pass through to affected mobilehome owners any new or increase in government mandated capital expenditures and operating expenses including taxes (other than the 2 percent annual increase authorized by California constitution article XIIIA, section 2(b)) and assessments, fees and mandated expenses due to code changes subject to the following procedure:

1. Upon a petition signed by one adult mobilehome owner for each of fifty percent (50%) of the spaces subject to rent control in a mobilehome park or fifty (50) spaces, whichever is less, and filed with the clerk within thirty (30) days of the date the owner gives notice of a government mandated expense pass-through to every affected mobilehome owner, the arbitrator, in accordance with the meet and confer and arbitration procedures provided in this chapter, may disallow or decrease the proposed pass-through based upon substantial evidence in the record that the pass-through is not legally proper, or is excessive, or that during the pass-through period the owner is including an unreasonably high financing cost and/or return on the expense being passed through.

D.    Utilities: If not billed by the utility directly to the mobilehome owner, an owner may separately pass through to a mobilehome owner charges for all utilities, including, but not limited to, sewer, water, garbage, cable TV, gas and electricity, and any increases in such charges, subject to compliance with sections 3960 through 3963 of this code. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this section, the owner shall not pass through any charge or expense for gas or electric service to the extent prohibited by section 739.5 of the California Public Utilities Code.

E.    Capital Improvement Pass-Through: An owner may charge to the affected mobilehome owner as additional rent the pro rata share of new service and capital improvement costs including reasonable financing costs if, prior to initiating the service or incurring the capital improvement cost, the owner has:

1. Consulted with the mobilehome owners prior to initiating construction of the improvements or initiating the new service regarding the nature and purpose of the improvements or services and the estimated cost of the improvements or services;

2. Obtained the prior written consent of at least one adult mobilehome owner in each of a majority of the mobilehome spaces which are occupied by the mobilehome owner to the proposed service or capital improvement. Each space shall have only one vote.

F.    Capital Replacement Pass-Through: Notwithstanding the provision of subsection E of this section, an owner may charge to the mobilehome owner as additional rent the pro rata share of capital replacement costs including reasonable financing costs, if not otherwise prohibited by law, subject to the following procedure:

1. The owner may seek advance approval for the proposed pass-through, before undertaking the capital project, by following the procedures set forth in sections 2709 to 2711 of this chapter. If the increase is approved by the arbitrator, it shall not be effective until the next regularly scheduled annual rent increase date, provided that the ninety (90) day notice is issued, the expense is actually incurred and that proper verification is submitted. This verification shall include, at a minimum, proof of actual costs and payment to vendors or contractors. In the event that the actual cost of the capital expense is less than the approved amount, the increase shall be adjusted to reflect this decreased amount;

2. The owner shall give notice of the proposed pass-through to each affected mobilehome owner no later than twelve (12) months after completion of the capital replacement work;

3. Upon a petition signed by one adult mobilehome owner of each of fifty percent (50%) of the spaces subject to rent control in a park or fifty (50) spaces subject to rent control, whichever is less, and filed with the clerk within thirty (30) days of the date the owner gives notice of the pass-through to every affected mobilehome owner, the arbitrator, in accordance with the arbitration procedure provided in this chapter, may disallow or decrease the pass-through for capital replacements based upon substantial evidence in the record that the capital replacement was not necessary, or that the cost of the capital replacement was excessive, or that during the pass-through period, the owner is including an unreasonably high financing cost and/or return on the expense being passed through. The owner shall have the burden of proving the necessity for and reasonable cost of the capital replacements. In determining whether the owner has met its burden of proving the necessity for and reasonable cost of the capital replacement, the arbitrator may consider, among other factors, the reasonableness of the owner’s history of maintenance of the property or improvement to be replaced. The arbitrator’s review will include, but not necessarily be limited to, the records reflecting past maintenance work and the cost.

G.    Billings; Charges Separate: All charges passed through by the owner to the mobilehome owners pursuant to subsections C and D of this section and additional rent charged pursuant to subsections E and F of this section must be separate from the base rent and listed separately. All billings used to calculate a pass-through or additional rent to mobilehome owners must be disclosed within a reasonable time upon request by a mobilehome owner.

H.    Notice: A written notice of each rent increase or new or increased capital improvement or capital replacement pass-through charge made under the provisions of this section shall be filed by the owner with the clerk, and provided to each affected mobilehome owner, at least ninety (90) days before the rent increase goes into effect or as required by the MRL. The notice shall identify the park and shall specify the dollar amount of the increase, the percentage of the increase, an itemization of all new or increased pass-throughs and additional rent charges, the specific space affected, the date the increase will go into effect, how each increase was calculated, and the date the rent on each affected space was last increased. The notice shall also advise each affected mobilehome owner of any right to petition for review of a proposed rent increase and that a petition form may be requested from the clerk.

I.    Filing Date: Whenever a time period is prescribed for filing an application or petition, the application or petition shall be deemed filed when it is first filed with the clerk, even if the clerk determines that the application or petition is not complete, provided that the clerk determines that application or petition is complete, as a result of additional submissions by the applicant or petitioner, within thirty (30) days of the initial filing. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2704 IN PLACE TRANSFER RENT INCREASES; ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW BASE RENT

A.    Whenever either of the following events occurs, an owner shall be permitted to charge a new base rent for the mobilehome space as provided in this section:

1. The termination of the tenancy of the affected mobilehome owner in accordance with the MRL1; or

2. The voluntary permanent removal of a mobilehome by a mobilehome owner. A removal of the mobilehome from the space for the purpose of performing rehabilitation or capital improvements to the space or for the purpose of upgrading the mobilehome shall not constitute a voluntary removal of the mobilehome.

B.    Upon the sale of a mobilehome in place, an owner may implement an increase of the base rent for that space in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the rent for that space then in effect.

C.    Except as provided in subsections A and B of this section, an owner may not condition an in place transfer of a mobilehome or condition assignment of an existing lease to a prospective mobilehome owner, upon agreement to an increased rent in anticipation of the in place transfer. This subsection shall not apply to specific conditions included in a lease exempt from rent control which allows an owner to condition assignment in a manner prohibited by this section. For purposes of this subsection, "a lease exempt from rent control" means a lease meeting, in all respects, the criteria of Civil Code section 798.17(b), as such criteria are presently enacted or may hereafter be amended. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2705 FAIR RETURN RENT INCREASES

If an owner presents evidence to the arbitrator, including any financial records requested by the arbitrator, which proves that the owner is denied a fair return by the rent control provisions of this chapter, the arbitrator may authorize an increase in rents as deemed appropriate by the arbitrator to provide a fair return to the owner. The arbitrator shall use the method set forth in subsection 2711C of this chapter to determine the fair return. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2706 RENT FREEZE OR RENT ROLLBACK

A.    Upon the petition signed by one adult mobilehome owner of fifty percent (50%) of the spaces subject to rent control in a park or fifty (50) spaces subject to rent control, whichever is less, the arbitrator may prohibit future rent increases for spaces governed by this chapter, upon its determination that maintenance by the owner has been substantially reduced and is insufficient to adequately maintain the park in a habitable condition. The determination shall be based upon substantial evidence in the record. The prohibition may be continued until the arbitrator determines that maintenance by the owner has been restored to a reasonable level.

B.    Upon petition by one or more affected mobilehome owners, an arbitrator may prohibit future rent increases, or order a rollback of the existing rent as to those petitioners, upon its determination that after November 19, 2010, an owner instituted a rent increase inconsistent with the criteria established by this chapter. The determination shall be based upon substantial evidence in the record. The prohibition may be continued until the arbitrator determines that the rent has become consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2707 TIME OF ALLOWED RENT INCREASE/ADJUSTMENT

A.    Once within a twelve (12) month period, the owner may implement a CPI rent adjustment (subsection 2703A of this chapter), if any, or a fair return increase (section 2705 of this chapter), but not both.

B.    A capital replacement pass-through under subsection 2703F of this chapter may only be implemented on the effective date of the CPI or fair return rent adjustment.

C.    The following increases or adjustments may be implemented at any time during the year:

1. Government mandated expense pass-through (subsection 2703C of this chapter);

2. Utility pass-throughs (subsection 2703D of this chapter);

3. Capital improvements (subsection 2703E of this chapter);

4. In place transfer rent increases (section 2704 of this chapter).

Any increases subject to arbitration shall be implemented after the final ruling of the arbitrator.

D.    Rent freeze and rent rollbacks shall be implemented at the time they are ordered (section 2706 of this chapter). (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2708 ARBITRATION

A.    Matters Subject To Arbitration:

1. An owner shall file with the clerk:

a. An application seeking to increase space rents beyond one hundred percent (100%) of the CPI to provide a fair return to the owner as allowed by section 2705 of this chapter.

C.    Cost Of Arbitration: The cost of arbitration shall be paid by the clerk out of revenue from the rent stabilization administration fee. The arbitrator may reimburse the city by assessing the cost of the arbitration to either party if the arbitrator determines that the position taken by the party is frivolous. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2709 PROCEDURES FOR FAIR RETURN NOTICE AND APPLICATION AND PETITION FORMS

A.    Notice: At least ten (10) days prior to submission of a fair return application or a petition to the clerk, the applicant or petitioner shall mail or deliver a notice and a copy of the application or petition to the owner and each affected mobilehome owner in the park.

C.    Insufficient Objection; Capital Replacement Or Government Mandated Pass-Through Proceeding; Clerk Action: If less than the required number of affected mobilehome owners object to a proposed capital replacement or government mandated pass-through, or if objection is withdrawn, including any amendments, before or after the meet and confer process, the clerk shall approve the requested pass-through. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2710 PROCEDURE FOR MEET AND CONFER

Within ten (10) working days of the date of the clerk’s notice of a completed application or petition and prior to assignment of an arbitrator, affected mobilehome owners and owners shall meet and confer with each other’s representatives. The time, place and date of the meeting shall be agreed to by the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, determined by the clerk. Written notice of the scheduled meeting shall be given by the applicant or petitioner. At the meeting, representatives of the parties shall exchange documentary evidence that the parties, in good faith then know, will be used to support their respective positions in an arbitration and discuss the issues in dispute. In the case of an owner, all financial data upon which any proposed increase is claimed shall be supplied to affected mobilehome owner representatives at the time of the meet and confer meeting. The parties may request that the clerk provide a mediator, at no cost to the parties, to assist with the meet and confer process. The arbitrator may deny an application based on the applicant’s failure to participate in good faith in the meet and confer process. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2711 PROCEDURES FOR ARBITRATION

A.    Notice Of Arbitration: The clerk shall give written notice to the applicant or petitioners and mobilehome owner representative that the application/petition has been referred to arbitration.

1. An arbitrator shall be appointed in the following manner:

a. Qualified Arbitrators: The clerk shall maintain a list of qualified arbitrators.

b. Assignment Of Arbitrator And Hearing Date: The clerk shall choose three (3) possible arbitrators and present them to the residents’ representative and the owner. Within five (5) days each party may challenge one candidate. The one remaining shall be the selected arbitrator. If both parties challenge the same candidate, the clerk shall choose between the two (2) remaining candidates. The clerk shall set a date for the arbitration hearing no sooner than thirty (30) or no later than forty (40) days after the arbitrator is assigned. The owner and affected mobilehome owners shall be notified immediately in writing by the clerk of the date, time and place of the hearing and this notice shall be served either in person or by ordinary mail. The parties may agree, in writing, to extend these times. The arbitrator may extend the date for the arbitration hearing upon a showing of good cause.

2. The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing with the parties and/or their representatives. During this hearing process, the concerns of each party shall be discussed and the arbitrator shall indicate the amount and nature of information needed from any party in order to reach a determination. In fair return proceedings in section 2705 of this chapter, this shall include four (4) years of the income and expense portion of the general ledgers for the park. All information submitted shall be in writing and shall be certified in the same manner as set forth in subsection 2709B of this chapter. The applicant or petitioner shall have the burden of proof unless other sections of this chapter specify otherwise. Each party shall comply with the arbitrator’s request for information within seven (7) days of the request. Additional information provided to the arbitrator shall be immediately available to the owner or affected mobilehome owner representative which will have seven (7) days to give written comment to the arbitrator. The arbitrator may proceed under this part regardless of whether any party defaults in providing any of the requested information.

B.    Arbitration Determination:

1. Within twenty one (21) days of the hearing, but no later than ninety (90) days from the date of the owner’s rent increase notice, the arbitrator shall deliver his or her decision on the application or petition and a bill for services to the clerk.

2. The rent increase in a fair return proceeding shall not exceed the increase requested in the application.

3. The clerk shall provide the result of the arbitrator’s decision to the affected parties.

4. The arbitrator’s decisions are final and not appealable to the city council.

C.    Method To Determine A Fair Return:

1. Base Year: The base year for the purpose of this section shall be the last full fiscal year prior to the park becoming subject to this chapter. The arbitrator may establish an alternative base year if the owner is unable to produce records of the last full fiscal year prior to the park becoming subject to rent control.

2. Maintenance Of Net Operating Income: It shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by the property during the base year provided a fair return. An owner shall be entitled to rents to earn a just and reasonable return and to maintain and increase their base year net operating income in accordance with subsection C4 of this section. This method is called maintenance of net operating income (MNOI) and shall be included in all applications.

3. Adjustment Of Base Year Net Operating Income: The applicant or the affected mobilehome owners may present evidence to rebut the presumption of fair and reasonable return based upon the base year net operating income. To make such a determination and in order to adjust to the base year net operating income, the arbitrator must make the following finding:

a. The owner’s operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so that the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. In considering whether the base year net operating income yielded more or less than a fair net operating income, the arbitrator shall consider the following factors:

(1) Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by uninsured disaster or vandalism;

(2) Maintenance and repairs were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration of housing services;

(3) Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding prudent business practice; and

(4) The rent in the base year was disproportionately low due to the fact that it was not established in an arms length transaction or other peculiar circumstances.

4. Fair Net Operating Income: The arbitrator shall submit a determination based on rental income which will provide the owner a net operating income which shall be increased by one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the CPI over the base year’s CPI index. The base year CPI shall be the CPI for June 1. For purposes of this section, the current CPI shall be the CPI last reported as of the date of the completed application.

5. Net Operating Income Defined: "Net operating income of a mobilehome park" means the gross income of the park less the operating expenses of the park.

6. Gross Income Defined: "Gross income" means the sum of the following:

a. Gross space rents computed as gross space rental income at one hundred percent (100%) occupancy (but excluding rent attributed to a space occupied by a park employee who receives the space rent free as part of the employee’s compensation); plus

b. Other income generated as a result of the operation of the park, including, but not limited to, fees for services actually rendered; plus

c. All other pass-through revenue received from mobilehome owners except capital pass-throughs and gas and electric; minus

d. Uncollected space rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent that the same are beyond the owner’s control. There is a rebuttable presumption that uncollected space rents in excess of the average of the current and past three (3) years’ uncollected rents (each year’s rent shall be adjusted by the change in the CPI between that year and the final year of the 4 year period) are excessive and shall not be deducted from gross income.

7. Operating Expenses Defined: "Operating expenses" means:

a. Real property taxes and assessment;

b. Advertising costs;

c. Management and administrative expenses including the compensation of administrative personnel;

d. Repair and maintenance expenses for the grounds and common facilities including, but not limited to, landscaping, cleaning and repair of equipment and facilities;

e. In addition to the management expenses listed above, where the owner performs on site managerial or maintenance services which are uncompensated, the owner may include the reasonable value of such services. Owner performed labor shall be limited to five percent (5%) of gross income unless the arbitrator finds that such a limitation would be substantially unfair in a given case. No credit for such services shall be authorized unless an owner documents the hours utilized in performing such services and the nature of the services provided;

f. Operating supplies such as janitorial supplies, gardening supplies, stationery and so forth;

g. Insurance premiums related to operation of the park prorated over the life of the policy;

h. Payroll taxes, business, utility, license and permit fees;

i. Dues;

j. Consultant services for park operation and maintenance;

k. All operating expenses must be reasonable and necessary. Whenever a particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other comparable standard, the owner shall bear the burden of proving the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that an arbitrator finds any expense to be unreasonable, the arbitrator shall adjust the expense to reflect the normal industry or other comparable standard;

l. There is a rebuttable presumption that expenditures in the current year are unreasonable to the extent that they substantially exceed the average of the current and past three (3) years (each year’s expenses shall be adjusted by the change in the CPI between that year and the final year of the 4 year period);

Operating expenses shall not include the following:

a. Mortgage debt service expenses;

b. Land lease expenses;

c. Depreciation;

d. Income taxes;

e. Electric and gas expenses included in section 739.5 of the California Public Utilities Code;

f. The cost of government mandated expenses (subsection 2703C of this chapter), capital improvements (subsection 2703E of this chapter), or capital replacements (subsection 2703F of this chapter).

8. Constitutionally Required Fair Return: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the arbitrator is authorized to approve any rent increase that is constitutionally required by law to yield a fair return.

D.    Subpoenas: The parties may obtain the issuance and service of a subpoena for the attendance of witnesses or the production of other evidence at the arbitration hearing. Subpoenas shall be issued and attested by the clerk. Issuance of the subpoena must be obtained upon the filing with the clerk of the city of an affidavit or declaration, under oath, setting forth the name and address of the proposed witness; specifying the exact things to be produced and the relevancy to the issues involved; and stating that the witness has the desired things in his/her possession or under his/her control.

Service of the subpoena on a witness to attend arbitration must be at least five (5) working days before the hearing. Service of a subpoena duces tecum must be at least twenty one (21) days before the hearing. Any party served with a subpoena duces tecum must produce copies of the requested items to the subpoenaing party no later than ten (10) days before the hearing.

A subpoena need not be issued when the affidavit or declaration is defective in any particular. No arbitration hearing may be continued due to the failure to file a timely request, or to timely serve a subpoena. Any person who refuses, without lawful excuse, to attend the arbitration or to produce relevant evidence as required by a subpoena served upon that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

No subpoena shall issue until after the parties have met and conferred as required in section 2710 of this chapter.

E.    Increases For Capital Expense: Increases attributed to a capital expense, as approved by the arbitrator to provide a park with a fair return, shall not be included in base rent. These increases must be separately itemized on the monthly rent invoice and terminate at the end of the approved amortized period. Advance approval and effective date of the increase shall be as allowed in subsection 2703F1 of this chapter.

(Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2712 REFUSAL OF MOBILEHOME OWNER TO PAY ILLEGAL RENT

An affected mobilehome owner may refuse to pay any rent in excess of the maximum rent permitted by this chapter. The fact that such unpaid rent is in excess of the maximum rent shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space for nonpayment of rent or to collect the illegal rent. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2713 DISCLOSURES

An owner shall disclose to each prospective tenant the current and proposed base rent for the mobilehome space and the rental agreement options required by this section and section 2714 of this chapter, provide each prospective tenant with a copy of this chapter, and disclose to the prospective tenant that if the prospective tenant signs a lease with a term of more than one year, that lease will be exempt from rent control. The owner shall give the required disclosure and provide a copy of this chapter to the prospective tenant at the time that the owner, or owner’s representative, receives the prospective tenant’s application for tenancy. The required disclosures shall be made in a form approved by the clerk, and the owner shall obtain a signature of the prospective tenant on the disclosure form acknowledging receipt of the disclosures. An owner must retain the signed disclosure form throughout the entire tenancy of the tenant. This signed form shall be made available to the clerk upon reasonable written notice. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2714 PROSPECTIVE MOBILEHOME OWNER; TENANCY TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS

All prospective tenants shall be offered the option of a tenancy of twelve (12) months or less upon terms consistent with the provisions of this chapter. This section shall not apply to prevent a mutually agreed upon assignment between an owner and an existing mobilehome owner of an existing lease, provided any such assignment does not violate subsection 2704C of this chapter. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2715 RENT STABILIZATION ADMINISTRATION FEES

All or any portion of the costs to administer this chapter may be collected by the imposition of an annual rent stabilization administration fee established by resolution of the city council. The fee shall be chargeable against the total number of mobilehome spaces in the city subject to rent control determined on a date certain each year to be established by the city council. The owner who pays these fees may pass through to the mobilehome owners, subject to rent control on the date established by the city council, fifty percent (50%) of the fees assessed against a mobilehome space. The fee shall be due on a date established by the city council but may be paid in quarterly installments by the owners. Owners of parks annexed to the city after November 19, 2010, shall be charged the fee established by resolution beginning on the effective date of the annexation. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)


§2716 AMENDMENT

Any amendment to this chapter shall require a prior public hearing before the city council with notice thereof published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. (Ord. 1126, adopted 2010)

§3016 MODIFICATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE

A.    The section of the California building code, relating to applications for building permits is modified to require in an application to demolish a building, the date when the building was first constructed, if known. The terms "demolish" or "demolition", as used in this section, shall mean: 1) the tearing down of all or part of a building or 2) the cumulative alteration of a building pursuant to one or more building permits issued over a five (5) year period, where fifty percent (50%) or more of the structural or exterior components of the building are removed or replaced. The review required by this section shall occur with the application for the permit that: 1) results in the tearing down of all or part of the building or 2) authorizes the cumulative alteration of the building that equals or exceeds the specified percentage.

B.    The section of the California building code, relating to the issuance of a building permit, is modified to require that, as to buildings constructed fifty (50) years or more prior to the date of application, the director of planning or his/her designee shall determine whether:

1. The building is an accessory building such as, but not limited to, a garage, storage shed, or carport, whether attached or detached to a main building; except that certain accessory buildings, such as carriage houses, which are presumed to have historic or architectural significance shall be subject to further review as provided in subsection D of this section, unless the building is subject to demolition under subsection B2 of this section.

2. Immediate demolition of the building is necessary to protect the public health or safety and the failure to immediately demolish the building would constitute a serious threat to the public health or safety.

C.    If subsection B1 or B2 of this section applies to the building, no further review shall be required under this section and the permit shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of the California building code.

D.    If the planning director finds that neither of the exceptions in subsection B1 or B2 of this section applies to the building, a building permit to demolish a building shall be subject to further review in accordance with this section. The planning director shall transmit the proposal to the demolition review committee, or other official reviewing body established by the city council, for review, comment, and a recommendation to the city council. Once the demolition review committee formulates a recommendation concerning the disposition of the proposed permit, the planning director shall schedule and duly notice the matter for a public hearing and decision by the city council. The public noticing shall indicate the day, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing, and how additional information about the subject matter can be obtained. The public noticing shall be accomplished in the following manner:

1. Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.

2. Mailing or delivery at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing to the owner(s) of the subject property, or his/her agent, and to the project applicant, if the applicant is not the owner.

3. First class mail notice to all owners (as shown on the latest available Mendocino County tax assessor’s equalized assessment roll) of property within three hundred feet (300’) of the subject property.

E.    In reviewing proposed permits, and formulating recommendations to the city council, the demolition review committee shall consider any information provided during the meeting, and shall use the following criteria. The structure:

1. Has a special or particular quality such as oldest, best example, largest, or last surviving example of its kind; or

2. Exemplifies or reflects special elements of the city’s cultural, social, economic, political, aesthetic, or architectural history; or

3. Is strongly identified with persons or events significant in local, state, or national history.

F.    If the demolition review committee finds that any of the criteria listed in subsection E of this section apply to the building proposed for demolition, it shall recommend denial of the permit to the city.

G.    1. The city council shall conduct a public hearing pursuant to subsection D of this section to consider the recommendation of the demolition review committee, and to determine if any of the criteria listed in subsection E of this section apply to the building proposed for demolition. If the city council determines that any one of the criteria applies, it shall make a corresponding finding to that effect.

2. At the hearing, the applicant shall have the opportunity to present evidence that a viable market does not exist for the building, taking into account the condition of the building, the probable cost to put the building into marketable condition, and the uses of the property allowed under existing or probable future zoning regulations. The city council shall consider such evidence offered by the applicant and any other information presented at the meeting by any interested party or by staff, to determine whether or not a viable market exists. "Viable market" means that it is reasonably likely that the building could be sold within a commercially reasonable period of time for more than the seller would be required to invest in the purchase of the property and preparing the property for sale, or that the property could produce a reasonable return on the amount of money it would take to purchase the property and prepare the building for income producing purposes. "Reasonable return" means the average rate of return on real estate investments in the Ukiah Valley.

3. If the city council determines that a viable market exists:

a. It shall so notify the building official who shall not issue the permit. The city council shall determine whether a viable market exists based on substantial evidence presented at the hearing, or, it may assume that a viable market exists, if the applicant fails to present substantial evidence that a viable market does not exist;

b. Not more than once within any twelve (12) month period, the applicant may submit a new application for a permit and the city council may reconsider whether a viable market exists:

(1) Upon a showing by the applicant that market conditions have changed; or

(2) Based upon new information that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the applicant could not have produced at the first hearing.

4. If the city council determines, based on substantial evidence, that a viable market does not exist, the issuance of the permit shall be stayed for a period of ninety (90) days.

a. During that ninety (90) day period, the city shall do the following:

(1) Determine whether other alternatives to demolition exist, which are acceptable to the applicant, that would preserve the historic, architectural or cultural significance of the building;

(2) Determine whether funds are available from any private source for the acquisition and preservation of the building through a negotiated purchase on terms acceptable to the applicant; or

(3) If sufficient funds are available from any private source and a negotiated purchase is not possible, determine whether to acquire the building through eminent domain.

b. If within the ninety (90) days, the city does not reach agreement with the applicant or commence acquisition of the building, the building official may issue the permit in accordance with the provisions of the California building code.

c. If within the ninety (90) day period, the city either: 1) reaches agreement with the applicant or 2) commences acquisition of the building, the building official shall not issue the permit.

d. However, the building official shall continue to process the application for the permit in accordance with the California building code, if the city and the applicant terminate their agreement or the city fails to diligently pursue or abandons acquisition of the building.

e. The city manager or his/her designee shall inform the building official whenever the city and the applicant terminate their agreement or the city fails to diligently pursue or abandons acquisition of the building.

f. If the building official has issued a demolition permit under this subsection and the permittee applies to extend the permit an additional one hundred eighty (180) days in accordance with the applicable provisions of the California building code then in effect, the building official shall refer the application to the city manager for an initial determination as to whether market conditions have changed. The city manager shall make the determination within ten (10) days after the application is referred by the building official. If the city manager determines that market conditions may have changed and that a viable market may exist for the property, he or she shall schedule the matter for a hearing before the city council to be noticed and conducted in accordance with subsection D of this section and this subsection G. However, at the hearing the city shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that market conditions have changed and a viable market exists. If the city manager determines that market conditions have not changed, he or she shall so notify the building official and the applicant. Upon such notification, the building official shall further process the application to extend the term of the permit in accordance with the requirements of the California building code then in effect. If the city council conducts a hearing upon referral by the city manager, the city clerk shall provide written notification to the building official and the applicant of the city council decision. If the city council decides that a viable market exists, the building official shall not issue the permit, but the provisions of subsection G3b of this section shall apply. If the city council decides that a viable market does not exist, the building official immediately shall proceed to further process the application in accordance with the applicable provisions of the California building code then in effect.

5. "Diligently pursue acquisition" means taking all steps within the time required by law to acquire the building by eminent domain.

6. References to "applicant" herein shall include the building owner.

H.    The planning director shall provide a written notice of the city council determination to the applicant. The written notification shall be mailed or hand delivered within five (5) days from the date of the city council’s decision. The notice shall include the finding(s) and decision made by the city council and a copy of this section.

I.    The applicant for a permit for a building determined to have historic, architectural or cultural significance shall salvage the building materials for reuse to the maximum extent feasible, and shall ensure that upon completion of the demolition, the site is left in a safe, presentable, and clutter free condition.

J.    1. Grounds For Reconsideration: The city council may reconsider a decision under this section within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the decision was made, if information that may have materially affected the decision was: a) misrepresented by the applicant, or b) not disclosed by the applicant, if the applicant knew or should have known that the information may have affected the city council decision. "Information" as used herein means matters of fact or law.

A decision may not be reconsidered, if all three (3) of the following have occurred: The permit: a) has been issued, b) did not at the time it was issued violate any provision of the California building code, as adopted by the city, or any other city ordinance or state or federal law, and c) the permittee has commenced demolition in good faith reliance on the permit.

2. Procedure On Reconsideration: Reconsideration of a decision under this section may be placed on the agenda for a regular city council meeting by any member of the city council who voted in favor of the original decision. Notice of any meeting where reconsideration is on the agenda shall be provided in accordance with subsection D of this section. If already issued, the permit shall be suspended from the date that an eligible city council member requests that the matter be placed on the agenda and until the city council makes a final decision upon reconsideration. The building official shall notify the applicant in writing of the permit suspension. At the meeting, the city council shall determine, based on evidence provided to the city prior to or during the meeting, whether reconsideration is permitted under subsection J1 of this section. Any motion to reconsider the decision shall contain findings supported by substantial evidence. If upon reconsideration the city council makes a different decision, the city clerk shall provide notice of that decision to the building official and the applicant/permittee within five (5) working days after the decision is made. If, upon reconsideration, the city council determines that a building has historic, architectural, or cultural significance, and the building official has issued a permit based on the previous decision, the building official shall revoke the permit. If the previously issued permit has expired, the building official shall deny an application for a new permit, unless the permit is issued in accordance with subsection G4 of this section. (Ord. 838, §1, adopted 1984; Ord. 927, §1, adopted 1992; Ord. 1014, §1, adopted 1998; Ord. 1103, §1, adopted 2007)


§3020 SMALL RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM REVIEW PROCESS

A.    The following words and phrases as used in this section are defined as follows:

"Electronic submittal" means the utilization of one or more of the following:

1. E-mail;

2. The Internet;

3. Facsimile.

"Small residential rooftop solar energy system" means all of the following:

1. A solar energy system that is no larger than ten (10) kilowatts alternating current nameplate rating or thirty (30) kilowatts thermal.

2. A solar energy system that conforms to all applicable state fire, structural, electrical, and other building codes as adopted or amended by the City and paragraph (iii) of subdivision (c) of section 714 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time.

3. A solar energy system that is installed on a single or duplex family dwelling.

4. A solar panel or module array that does not exceed the maximum legal building height as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

"Solar energy system" has the same meaning set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of section 801.5 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time.

B.    Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that, on or before September 30, 2015, every city, county, or city and county shall adopt an ordinance that creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for small residential rooftop solar energy systems.

C.    Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt such checklist.

D.    The checklist shall be published on the City’s Internet website together with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature.

E.    Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall:

1. Verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and

2. At the applicant’s cost, verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system’s current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads.

F.    For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the Building Official and Fire Chief. If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however, the subsequent inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection.

G.    An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the Building Official, shall be deemed complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the Building Official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.

H.    Upon confirmation by the Building Official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the Building Official shall administratively approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local utility provider’s electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider. (Ord. 1162, §1, adopted 2015)

§3073:    Scope


§3070 PURPOSE

The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on buildings with unreinforced masonry bearing walls. There is a substantial risk that such buildings may sustain life-hazardous damage during moderate to strong earthquakes. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989)


§3071 PROVISIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS 8875-8875.5

The provisions of this chapter are intended to establish minimum standards for structural seismic resistance as provided in the California existing building code and the California historical building code. While compliance with these standards is intended to improve the performance of potentially hazardous buildings in an earthquake, such compliance will not necessarily prevent the loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake related damage to rehabilitated buildings. This chapter does not address buildings that contain only nonbearing masonry walls or buildings constructed of nonmasonry materials. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989; Ord. 1103, §1, adopted 2007)


§3072 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

Nothing in this chapter is intended to create liability on the part of the city of which, any officer or employee thereof, or the state of California for any earthquake related damage suffered by any building whether or not such building complies with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989)


§3073 SCOPE

The provisions herein shall apply to all buildings constructed with unreinforced masonry bearing walls as described in Government Code section 8875(a). (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989)

ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS

SECTION:

§3074:    Definitions


§3074 DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:

OWNER: The owner of real property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll maintained by the Mendocino county assessor.

POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS BUILDING: Any building constructed prior to the adoption by the city of Ukiah of the California building code provisions requiring earthquake resistant design of buildings and constructed of unreinforced masonry bearing walls.

UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL: A masonry wall having all of the following characteristics:

A. Provides the vertical support for a floor or roof.

B. The total superimposed load is over one hundred (100) pounds per linear foot.

C. The area of reinforcing steel is less than fifty percent (50%) of that required by the California building code for reinforced masonry. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989; Ord. 1103, §1, adopted 2007)

§3076 POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS BUILDINGS LIST

The city building official or his designee shall systematically compile and maintain a list of all potentially hazardous buildings constructed with unreinforced masonry bearing walls ("potentially hazardous buildings list"). The owners of all buildings placed on the list shall be notified by regular first class mail that their buildings have been included on the list.

Once a building is designated as potentially hazardous and is included on the potentially hazardous buildings list, the building owner or agent thereof shall:

A.    File with the city building official a written engineering survey and evaluation ("earthquake safety report") subject to the approval of the building official within a time period not to exceed two (2) years from the date of notification pursuant to this section. The earthquake safety report shall be obtained by the property owner and conducted by a civil or structural engineer or architect licensed by the state of California who is knowledgable in earthquake resistant design.

The earthquake safety report shall determine the feasibility of rehabilitating the building to meet, at a minimum, the structural standards of the California existing building code and the California historical building code, including a description of the building’s ability to resist seismic activity and a reasonably detailed description of the changes recommended by the engineer or architect to improve the ability of the building to resist damage in an earthquake and, at a minimum, to meet the structural standards of the California existing building code and the California historical building code.

The report must contain sufficient factual detail and engineering analysis to allow independent review and evaluation by a competent professional.

B.    Until made to comply with the provisions of the California existing building code and the California historical building code adopted in this chapter, post an eight inch by ten inch (8" x 10") minimum sign in a conspicuous location in or on the building which is in public view at all times. The sign shall have the first two (2) words of the following statement printed in 50-point bold type and the remaining words in at least 30-point type. The text shall read as follows:

EARTHQUAKE WARNING this is an unreinforced masonry building. You may not be safe inside or near unreinforced masonry buildings during an earthquake.

If the earthquake safety report concludes that a building is so hazardous that it cannot be feasibly rehabilitated to meet the standards of the California existing building code and the California historical building code, abatement proceedings shall be initiated to require demolition of the building as provided in chapter 10 of this division, and thereafter the building shall be removed from the potentially hazardous buildings list. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989; Ord. 914, §1, adopted 1990; Ord. 1103, §1, adopted 2007)


§3079 APPEAL

Any owner dissatisfied with a determination under this chapter, including the compliance schedule affecting his or her property or the inclusion of the owner’s building on the potentially hazardous buildings list shall have the right to appeal that decision to the city council or, in the city council’s discretion, to the board of appeals established under the California building code.

A.    The owner must file a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the date when the notice of decision appealed from is deposited in the U.S. mail or personally delivered to the owner.

B.    The city council or board of appeals must render its decision within sixty (60) days of the date when the written notice of appeal is filed with the city clerk.

C.    The appellant shall have the right to appear personally and be represented at a hearing on the appeal of which the appellant must be given ten (10) days’ prior written notice. After conducting the hearing, the city council or board shall render a decision in writing which shall be based on the evidence and argument received during the hearing. The decision shall be final for the city and there shall be no right to request reconsideration. (Ord. 897, §1, adopted 1989; Ord. 1103, §1, adopted 2007)


§3080 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION

A.    Infraction, Continuing Violation: Any person who violates or neglects to comply with any provision of this chapter or any resolution or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto shall be guilty of an infraction, punishable by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation; two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second violation within one year; and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each additional violation within one year of committing the first offense.

Failure to file the reports or post the notice required by section 3076 of this article or to comply with the compliance schedule authorized by section 3075 of this chapter shall constitute a separate and distinct offense and violation of this chapter for each day or fraction thereof that such failure or noncompliance continues.

B.    Civil Action Authorized: In addition to any other penalties provided by law for violation of this chapter the city attorney is authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter by civil action, including actions seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages.

The city shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney and expert witness fees as additional items of cost if it prevails in any action brought pursuant to this section. The city intends that this provision to recover attorney fees shall constitute a statute specifically providing for the recovery of attorney fees within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") section 1021 or any successor provision of the CCP.

F.    All permanent freestanding signs or poles shall be self-supporting structures erected on and permanently attached to concrete foundations. Such structures or poles shall be fabricated only from steel or other such materials as approved by the Building Code.

G.    All signs of a building shall be constructed to withstand wind loads of thirty (30) pounds per square foot of the total face area of the letters and other sign surface.

Note: The wind load quoted above is a normal average and must be adjusted for areas subject to unusually high velocity winds and wind conditions.

H.    No sign shall be suspended by chains or other devices that will allow the sign to swing due to wind action. Signs shall be anchored to prevent any lateral movement that would cause wear on supporting members or connections. (Ord. 756, §2, adopted 1981; amd. by Ord. 822, §1, adopted 1983)

The provisions of this paragraph will apply to any and all areas upon annexation.

B.    All temporary signs and temporary sign structures which were erected and in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance, but which do not meet the requirements of this ordinance, shall be permitted to remain in existence notwithstanding their nonconforming character for a period of sixty (60) days from the effective date of this ordinance.

The City Council finds that this is a reasonable amortization period because all signs which must be removed under this Section have been in existence for at least three (3) years prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

E.    Ordinary maintenance and associated minor repairs may be made to any nonconforming sign providing no structural alterations or design changes are made. Other repairs, alterations, or design changes may be permitted; provided, that a use permit shall be first secured in each case and that such repairs, alterations or design changes comply all other provisions of this Chapter 7.

§3400 PURPOSE AND SCOPE

A.    In order to further the stated goals of the city of Ukiah to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by requiring a level of maintenance of private commercially zoned property which will protect the livability, appearance and social and economic stability of the city and to protect its citizens and their commercially zoned property from conditions detrimental to property values and community appearance, hazardous or injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the general public, or which are offensive or annoying to the senses, the city council has determined that this chapter is necessary to effectively abate or prevent the development of such conditions in the city of Ukiah.

B.    It is the intention of the city council, in adopting the chapter codified herein, to set forth guidelines for determining what conditions on private commercially zoned property constitute a public health, safety, and visual blight problem; to establish a method for giving notice of the conditions and an opportunity to correct them; and finally in the event the public health, safety, and visual blight conditions are not abated or corrected, to provide a procedure for a hearing and determination of the facts and manner in which the conditions shall be corrected or removed.

C.    It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a fair and practical method, in addition to any other remedy available at law, whereby commercially zoned property/ buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, dangerous, unsanitary, cluttered with weeds, debris, abandoned, or inoperable vehicles, machinery or equipment, or are a menace, or hazard to life, limb, safety, health, property values, aesthetic standards or the general welfare of the city of Ukiah, may be required to be repaired, renovated, vacated, demolished, made safe, or cleaned up by removal of offensive conditions.

D.    Another purpose of this chapter is to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures on private commercially zoned property, as well as public property and to provide regulations designed to prevent and control the further spread of graffiti in the city.

E.    In addition to the abatement procedures provided herein, this chapter declares certain conditions to be public health, safety, and visual blight nuisances and that continuance of such conditions shall be a misdemeanor.

F.    This chapter is not intended to enforce conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CC&Rs) on property, nor to supersede them. This chapter will be enforced uniformly within the city regardless of CC&Rs. Therefore, this chapter does not abrogate the right of any homeowners’ association or private citizen to take action, legal or as otherwise provided in the CC&Rs, to force compliance with the CC&Rs applicable to their tract or association even though the CC&R provisions may be the same, more restrictive or may not be covered by this chapter.

G.    Provisions of this chapter are to be supplementary and complementary to all of the provisions of this code, state and federal law, and any law cognizable at common law or in equity, and nothing herein shall be read, interpreted or construed in any manner so as to limit any existing right or power of the city to abate any and all public health, safety, and visual blight problems.

H.    Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, any condition which would constitute a violation of this chapter, but which is expressly authorized under any city, state or federal law, shall not be deemed to violate this chapter.

I.    Every owner of real commercially zoned property within the city is required to maintain such property in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of this chapter and such owner remains liable for violations thereof regardless of any contract or agreement with any third party regarding such property. Every occupant, lessee or holder of any interest in commercially zoned property, other than as owner thereof, is required to maintain such property in the same manner as is required of the owner thereof, and the duty imposed by this section on the owner thereof shall in no instance relieve those persons herein referred to from the similar duty.

b. Abatement: If the city manager or his/her designee is unable to make contact as hereinabove noted, or if the appropriate persons after notification by the city manager or his designee do not take action within such time as may be specified by such official, then the city manager/designee may take all actions deemed necessary in order to protect the public from harm to remove, repair or isolate such dangerous condition or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor engaged pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3417 RECORD OF ABATEMENT COSTS

A.    If abatement action is taken by the city, all costs of the abatement will be assessed against the property and will attach as a lien until paid.

Costs of expenses for which the city may be reimbursed shall begin to accrue at the time the city first receives a complaint regarding a problem on the property.

The costs of abatement shall include the total city cost of inspections and enforcement (excluding the actual costs of abatement which shall be itemized as set forth in subsection B of this section), which shall be set by resolution of the city council. An additional fee which shall be set by resolution of the city council shall be imposed on the owner of the property at the conclusion of any matter in which a notice and order has been issued. This termination fee shall be calculated to recover the cost of closing the file, removing or placing liens, and other associated administrative costs. Costs shall be assessed at the conclusion of the abatement provided, however, in the case of the abatement by any method which takes more than six (6) months, costs may be assessed at any time after six (6) months, but in no event more than two (2) times a year.

Costs and expenses may be recovered even if the nuisance is corrected voluntarily, subsequent to the issuance of an abatement order. No fees shall be due and owing if an appeal is filed and the appeal is sustained. All fees shall be a personal obligation of the owner and a lien upon the property and are due and payable within thirty (30) days of issuance of the notice and order or closing of the file respectively; provided that if an appeal is filed, the fees shall be due and payable upon a final decision on the appeal. Any fee not paid within that time shall be payable to the city.

B.    The city manager/designee shall keep an account of the costs (including incidental expenses) of abating such nuisance on each separate lot or parcel of land where the work is done and shall render an itemized billing to the property owner which shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days. If the owner refuses or neglects to pay the bill, an itemized report in writing shall be made to the city council showing the cost of abatement and the rehabilitation, demolishing or repairing of said premises, building or structures, including any salvage value relating thereto; provided, that before said report is submitted to the city council a copy of the same shall be mailed together with a notice of the time when said report shall be heard by the city council for confirmation.

C.    The city council shall set the matter for hearing to determine the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such costs, and shall serve notice thereof.

D.    Proof of said service shall be made by declaration under penalty of perjury filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3418 ABATEMENT COST HEARING AND PROCEEDINGS

At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the report, the city council shall hear and pass upon the reports of such costs of abatement, together with any objections or protests raised by any of the persons liable to be assessed for the cost of abating the nuisance.

Thereupon, the city council may make such revision, correction or modification in the report, as it may deem just, after which, by motion, the report, as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The hearing may be continued from time to time. The decision of the city council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3419 NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN

A.    If the nuisance abatement and related administrative costs are not paid within five (5) days after the city council confirms the costs of abatement, the city shall notify the owner of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current, that a nuisance abatement lien will be recorded. The notice shall specify the amount of the lien, the name of the city, the date of the abatement order, the street address, the legal description and the assessor’s parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the owner of the parcel. The notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with article 3 (commencing with section 415.10) of chapter 4 of title 5 of part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Mendocino County pursuant to section 6062 of the Government Code. The notice of lien shall be in substantially the form provided in subsection 3420B of this chapter.

B.    After notice is given in accordance with subsection A of this section, the notice of lien shall be recorded in the Mendocino County recorder’s office and shall thereafter constitute a lien on the real property for the expense of the abatement, and the related administrative costs (assessed in accordance with subsection 3417A of this chapter) together with interest thereon.

C.    In the event the lien is discharged, released or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the same information as the notice of lien shall be recorded in the Mendocino County recorder’s office.

D.    The city may enforce the nuisance abatement lien by an action for a money judgment. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3420 ASSESSMENT COSTS

A.    As an alternate to the procedure set forth in section 3419 of this chapter, the city may use a special assessment procedure to collect the abatement costs. The total cost for abating such nuisance, as so confirmed by the city council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of a notice of lien, as so made and confirmed, shall constitute a lien on said property for the amount of such assessment.

1. After such confirmation and recordation a copy may be turned over to the tax collector for the county, whereupon it shall be the duty of the tax collector to add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against said respective lots and parcels of land for municipal purposes, and thereafter said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided of ordinary municipal taxes; or

2. After such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law.

B.    Such notice of lien for recordation shall be in the form substantially as follows:

NOTICE OF LIEN

(ACKNOWLEDGEMENT)

C.    The city council may order a refund of all or part of the assessment paid pursuant to this chapter if it finds that all or part of the assessment was erroneously levied. An assessment or part thereof shall not be refunded unless a claim is filed with a city clerk within six (6) months after the assessment became due and payable. The claim shall be verified by the person who paid the assessment, or the legal representative of such person. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3421 OWNER’S PERSONAL OBLIGATION

A.    The confirmed cost of abatement of a nuisance upon any lot or parcel of land shall constitute a personal obligation of the property owner and the city manager/ designee is authorized to commence an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the cost of abatement from the property owner.

B.    Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two (2) year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated in accordance with this chapter, except for conditions abated pursuant to section 17980 of the California Health and Safety Code, the court may order the owner to pay triple the costs of the abatement. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3422 ALTERNATIVE COLLECTION METHODS

A civil action to foreclose a lien, the special assessment procedure and a personal action against the owner shall not be mutually exclusive and the city shall be free to use all methods simultaneously as long as the city does not receive multiple payment for the abatement costs. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3423 ALTERNATIVE PROCEEDINGS

A.    Nothing in the foregoing sections shall be deemed to prevent the city council from ordering the city attorney to commence any appropriate civil action to abate a nuisance in addition to, alternatively to, or in conjunction with the proceedings set forth in this chapter; nor shall anything in this chapter be deemed to prevent the commencement of a criminal action with respect to the nuisance in addition to, alternatively to, or in conjunction with, the proceedings set forth in this chapter, nor shall any provision herein be deemed to prevent or limit an action for private nuisance by any person.

B.    Pursuant to section 38773.5 of the Government Code, in any proceeding brought to enforce any order, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorney fees, provided that, pursuant to section 38773.5, attorney fees shall only be available in those proceedings in which the city has provided notice at the commencement of such proceedings that it intends to seek and recover attorney fees. The city may recover its costs and attorney fees as part of the judgment which may be recorded as an assessment against the property and constitute a lien thereon. This section grants specific authority to any court of competent jurisdiction to grant an award of costs and attorney fees which may be used alternatively to, or in conjunction with, the procedures set forth above; however, in no event may the city obtain a double recovery. Failure of a court to award attorney fees as part of a judgment does not preclude the city from assessing costs against the property pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. (Ord. 1039, §1, adopted 2002)


§3424 VIOLATION – PENALTY

The reasonable period for purposes of this chapter shall be thirty (30) days from service of a notice of violation unless otherwise directed by the city council.

D.    Abatement Interference: Any person who obstructs, impedes or interferes with any representative, officer, employee, contractor or authorized representative of the city council or with any representative of a city department or with any person who owns or holds any estate or interest in a building which has been ordered to be vacated, repaired, rehabilitated or demolished pursuant to the provisions of this chapter when any of the aforementioned individuals are engaged in the work of abating any nuisance as required by the provisions of this chapter, or in performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work authorized or directed pursuant to this chapter lawfully engaged in proceedings involving the abatement of a nuisance is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two (2) year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated in accordance with this chapter, except for conditions abated pursuant to section 17980 of the Health and Safety Code, related to substandard buildings, the court may order the owner to pay treble the costs of the abatement.

The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ad valorem property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for property taxes.

B.    The City Council shall adopt a resolution assessing such unpaid costs of abatement as liens upon the respective parcels of land as they are shown upon the last available assessment roll. (Ord. 1133, §1, adopted 2012)


§3464 IMPOSITION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT LIEN AND NOTICE

A.    The City Clerk shall prepare and file with the County Auditor a certified copy of the resolution of the City Council assessing the costs of abatement as a lien on the land, adopted pursuant to section 3463 of this code.

B.    Notice of lien shall be mailed by certified mail to the property owner, if the property owner’s identity can be determined from the County Assessor’s or County Recorder’s records. The notice shall be given at the time of imposing the assessment and shall specify that the property may be sold after three (3) years by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The Tax Collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice.

C.    The County Auditor shall enter each assessment on the County tax roll upon the parcel of land. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ad valorem real property taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and procedure and sale in case of delinquency as is provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

§3700 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL – GENERAL POLICY

A.    Purpose: The purpose of this Article is:

1. To protect the public potable water supply of the City from the possibility of contamination or pollution:

a. by isolating within its customers’ internal distribution system(s) or its customers’ private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the public water supply system; and

b. by isolating contaminants or pollutants of potential intermittent, temporary and emergency users of the water system including but not limited to use of fire hydrants or blow-offs.

2. To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections actual or potential, between its customers’ in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and

3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.

B.    Responsibility: The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow or back-siphonage of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said Director of Public Works, an approved backflow prevention device is required at the City’s water service connection to any customer’s premises, for the safety of the water system, the Director of Public Works or designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to the premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved device or devices at customer’s own expense; and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install said device or devices immediately shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have been properly installed. (Ord. 874, §1, adopted 1988)


§3701 DEFINITIONS

A.    "Director of Public Works": The Director of Public Works of the City is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance.

B.    "Approved": Accepted by the Director of Public Works as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this ordinance, or as suitable for the proposed use.

C.    "Auxiliary Water Supply": Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor’s approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These waters may be polluted or contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.

D.    "Backflow": The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source or sources other than its intended source.

E.    "Back-siphonage": The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system.

F.    "Backflow Preventer": A device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-siphonage.

1. "Air-Gap": The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel; and, in no case less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable water system, an emergency by-pass shall be installed around the air-gap system and an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the by-pass system.

2. "Reduced Pressure Principle Device": An assembly of two (2) independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valve between the two (2) check valves, tightly closing shut-off valves on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and City approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check valves at a level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of the normal flow the pressure between the two (2) check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2) pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged.

3. "Double Check Valve Assembly": An assembly of two (2) independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized, and City approved, testing agency for backflow prevention devices. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing.

G.    "Contamination": Means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.

H.    "Cross-connection": Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two (2) otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow or back-siphonage may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection between a public potable water distribution system and a customer’s water distribution system which is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture, industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary water system, constitutes one type of cross-connection. Other types of cross-connections include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices, sliding multiport tube, solid connections, etc.

I.    "Cross-connections – Controlled": A connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

J.    "Cross-connection Control by Containment": The installation of an approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer’s premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer’s water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer’s water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of cross-connection.

K.    "Hazard, Degree of": The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.

1. "Hazard – Health": Any condition, device or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the Director of Public Works may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural defect, including cross-connections, in a water system.

2. "Hazard – Plumbing": A plumbing type cross-connection in a customer’s potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuumbreaker, air-gap separation or backflow prevention device: Unprotected plumbing type cross-connections are considered to be a health hazard.

3. "Hazard – Pollutional": An actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer’s potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.

4. "Hazard – System": An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer’s potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.

L.    "Industrial Fluids System": Any system containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of processed waters and "used waters" originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies, circulated cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for fire-fighting purposes.

M.    "Pollution": Means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.

N.    "Water – Potable": Any water which, according to recognized standards is safe for human consumption.

O.    "Water – Nonpotable": Water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability.

P.    "Water – Service Connections": The terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system; i.e., where the Water Purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer’s water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer’s water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.

Q.    "Water – Used": Any water supplied by a Water Purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer’s water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the Water Purveyor. (Ord. 874, §1, adopted 1988)


§3702 REQUIREMENTS

A.    Water System:

1. The water system shall be considered as made up of two (2) parts: The Utility System and the Customer System.

2. Utility System shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system; and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer’s system begins.

3. The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution system.

4. The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer’s system.

5. The customer’s system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.

B.    Policy:

1. No water service connection to any premises or from a fire hydrant or any other temporary or emergency water service connection from the public potable water system shall be installed or maintained by the City unless the water supply is protected as required by State laws and regulations and this ordinance. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the City if a backflow prevention device required by the ordinance is not installed, tested and maintained or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed, by-passed or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. Temporary, intermittent and emergency users of the water system shall be considered as consumers on premises for the purposes of this Article and shall be subject to the same cross-connection control requirements as water service connections to any premises.

2. The customer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Director of Public Works to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Director of Public Works shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with State and City statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

3. An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on each service line to a customer’s water system in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:

a. In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the Director of Public Works, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.

b. In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of processed waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.

c. In the case of premises having (a) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line.

4. The type of protective device required under subsections B3a, b and c shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:

a. In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection B3a of this Section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall, as a minimum, be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device.

b. In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall, as a minimum, be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.

c. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall, as a minimum, be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.

e. In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow or back-siphonage from the premises by the installation of a backflow prevention device in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be required; that is, as a minimum, an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed in each service to the premises.

f. In the case of premises with cross-connections to sewage lines, pumps, flushers, etc., the public water system shall, as a minimum, be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. Examples include sewage treatment plants and pumping stations.

g. In the case of tanker and spray tanks of forty nine (49) gallons or more, as a minimum, an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device is required.

5. Any backflow prevention device required herein shall be of a model and size approved by the Director of Public Works. The term "approved backflow prevention device" shall mean a device that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) entitled:

AWWA C506-78 Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices

and, have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCC & HR) of the University of Southern California established by

Specifications of Backflow Prevention Devices – #69-2, dated March 1969 or the most current issue.

A list of protective devices of the types referred to in this Article which have been approved by the Public Works Director will be maintained at City Hall and shall be open to public inspection. The list will be updated from time-to-time by the Public Works Director.

Backflow preventors which may be subjected to back pressure or back-siphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory’s current list of "Approved Devices" may be used without further test or qualification.

6. It shall be the duty of the water user or property owner at any premises where backflow prevention devices are installed, relocated, modified, or repaired, to have certified inspections and operational tests and repairs made initially upon installation and, at least once per year thereafter. In those instances where the Director of Public Works deems the hazard to be great enough, he may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections, tests and repairs shall be performed by the City or by a certified tester approved by the Director of Public Works. It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Works to see that these timely tests and repairs are made. All repairs deemed necessary as a result of the test shall be made by and at the expense of the water user or property owner. If testing is performed other than by the City, the customer/user shall notify the Director of Public Works in advance of when the tests are to be undertaken so that he or his representative may witness the tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced by a certified individual or agency at the expense of the customer/user whenever said devices are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be maintained by the water user or property owner and a copy submitted to the Director of Public Works.

7. All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not meet the requirements of this Section but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, will, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection B6, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Director of Public Works is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the Director of Public Works finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of this Section.

8. All existing water connections which may be deemed by the Director of Public Works to be subject to backflow prevention will, upon written notice, have an appropriate backflow prevention device installed and inspected within sixty (60) days of said notification.

B.    No person, and/or facility shall discharge grease to the POTW, except as expressly authorized by this article. If such discharge occurs, the person or facility shall be considered in violation of this article and subject to the remedies described herein. This includes nonpermitted facilities.

C.    In addition to prohibiting certain conduct by natural persons, it is the intent of this article to hold a corporation, association, LLC, LLP, or other entity or organization legally responsible for prohibited conduct performed by an agent acting on behalf of such an entity and within the scope of his office or employment.

A.    Exception: Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following adoption hereof, although installation of grease traps will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the facility. If, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the city will take appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in this article, against the generator or contributor of such grease.

B.    Minor Violation: Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to a written warning for the first violation, a five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty for the second violation, a one thousand dollar ($1,000.00) civil penalty for the third violation, a two thousand dollar ($2,000.00) civil penalty for the fourth violation, and an additional five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty for each subsequent violation (e.g., $3,000.00 for a fifth violation, $3,500.00 for a sixth violation) within a two (2) year period. A fifth or subsequent violation within a two (2) year period may result in termination of service.

C.    Major Violation: If the city through the director or his designee determines that a user is responsible for a blockage of a collection system line:

1. For the first offense, a field citation with date for compliance shall be issued to the responsible person on site. The focus of the citation shall be education. The cost of removal of the blockage shall not be assessed for the first occurrence. However, the facility shall be notified of the cost that they may incur for additional violations in the future.

2. For the second offense within a twelve (12) month period, a notice of violation shall be issued with a penalty of no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in addition to the cost of the removal of both the first blockage which gave rise to the first offense and the second blockage which gave rise to the second offense to be assessed. The discharger shall be informed that a future blockage resulting from a violation will result in termination of sewer service.

3. For the third offense within a two (2) year period, a notice of violation shall be issued with a penalty of no less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation plus the cost of the removal of the blockage and termination of sewer service. (Ord. 1118, §1, adopted 2009)


§3798A.13 APPEAL PROCESS

A.    The city council of the city of Ukiah shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the inspector or director in the enforcement or administration of this article.

B.    Appeals shall be made in writing to the director not more than thirty (30) days from the date the appealing party received notice of the disputed decision which shall be heard by the city council at a regular meeting held not less than thirty (30) days from the date the appeal is filed with the director.

SECTION:

§3960    Definitions

§3961    Billing Tenants For Water Or Sewer Service

§3962    Computing The Pro Rata Share

§3960 DEFINITIONS

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

CITY CHARGES: The actual amount billed by the city each month to the customer for water and sewer service to the master meter serving the multi-unit property.

CUSTOMER: The person or entity which has assumed the legal obligation to pay for water or sewer service, when that service is provided to a multi-unit property.

MONTHLY UTILITY BILL: The bill from the customer to a tenant for the pro rata share of city charges.

MULTI-UNIT PROPERTY: A mobile home park as defined in California Civil Code section 798.4 or an apartment building or complex, consisting of more than three (3) apartments.

PRO RATA SHARE: The amount of city charges which the customer may bill to a tenant each month. City charges may only be recovered in monthly billings to the tenants.

REQUIRED RECORDS: The monthly bill to the customer from the city of Ukiah for water and sewer service to the master meter and the computation of the pro rata share.

SEWER SERVICE PERIOD: Water meter readings for the month or months used by the city to determine monthly sewer service charges.

SUBMETER: A meter installed on a multi-unit property for measuring water use in an individual apartment or mobile home occupying a rented mobile home space. Submeters may be used at a multi-unit property only if they are installed in each apartment or space and all common areas, such as laundry facilities, receiving water or sewer service.

TENANT: The person or persons who rent a space in a mobile home park or an apartment in an apartment building or complex.

UNIT OF WATER: One hundred (100) cubic feet ("hcf") or 748.1 gallons of water. (Ord. 1117, §1, adopted 2009)


§3961 BILLING TENANTS FOR WATER OR SEWER SERVICE

A customer may submit a monthly utility bill to a tenant for his or her pro rata share of city charges in accordance with this article.

Monthly utility bills must be delivered to and payable by a tenant each month. The bill must contain the required records for the month for which the tenant is being billed. The bill must describe the location within the multi-unit property where required records for other months are located and shall state that any tenant and the city shall have access to these records during regular business hours and the right to examine, audit or copy them. In addition, a customer may provide tenants and the city internet access to required records. (Ord. 1117, §1, adopted 2009)


§3962 COMPUTING THE PRO RATA SHARE

A.    No Submeters: For a multi-unit property that does not use submeters, the pro rata share shall be determined by dividing the city charges by the number of mobile home spaces or apartments within the multi-unit property which receive water or sewer service. The result of that computation shall be the pro rata share for that month.

B.    Submeters: For a multi-unit property that uses submeters, the pro rata share for water and sewer service shall be determined as follows:

1. Water Service: The pro rata share of the city charges for water service shall be determined by a formula, where:

X = City charges for water service.

Y = Units of water used by the individual tenant based on the submeter reading for the tenant’s space or apartment.

T = Total units of water included in city charges.

P = Per unit charge for water.

R = The charge to the tenant for water (pro rata share).

The master meter reading and the submeter reading used in calculating the pro rata share shall be for the time period covered by the city charges.

The formula used to calculate the pro rata share is:

R = (X/T) x Y

The formula computes the pro rata share by dividing the city charges for water service by the total units of water included in the city charges to determine the per unit charge for water. The per unit charge is multiplied by the total units of water used by the tenant based on the reading of the tenant’s individual submeter for his or her mobile home park space or apartment.

2. Sewer Service: The pro rata share of the city charges for sewer service shall be determined by two (2) separate calculations which are added together to determine the tenant’s pro rata share as follows:

a. The total units of water from all of the submeter readings for the sewer service period is subtracted from the total units of water used by the multi-unit property for the sewer service period as shown by the master meter ("master meter total"). That number is divided by the master meter total to produce a fraction or percentage. That fraction or percentage is multiplied by the city charges for sewer service. The resulting dollar amount is prorated equally among the tenants by dividing it by the total number of rented spaces or apartments in the multi-unit property.

b. The remaining portion of the city charges for sewer service is prorated among the tenants by creating a fraction for each tenant with the numerator being that tenant’s submeter reading for the sewer service period and the denominator being the total submeter readings for the sewer service period. The tenant’s pro rata share of these remaining city charges is computed by multiplying those charges by this fraction. (Ord. 1117, §1, adopted 2009; Ord. 1119, §1, adopted 2009)


§3963 PENALTIES AND REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION

A.    Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an infraction. Every such violation is punishable by: 1) a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation; 2) a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second violation within one year; 3) a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each additional violation within one year.

B.    A violation of any provision of this article by any person, firm or corporation shall be subject to a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the small claims court, by a tenant, tenants’ association or the city of Ukiah, by its city attorney, to recover any damages caused by the violation, including a refund of excess city charges or allowed charges and a civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or ten percent (10%) of actual damages, whichever is higher. For any wilful violation, the tenant, tenants’ association or city may recover treble damages. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the filing of an action as authorized herein as a class action. The prevailing party in any action filed pursuant to this subsection shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees to be determined by the court. (Ord. 1117, §1, adopted 2009)

Data stored in computer memory may be lost or altered as a result of these fluctuations or interruptions. Surge protectors, uninterruptible power supplies and other devices are available on the market that may reduce the risk of damage resulting from fluctuations and interruptions in the flow of electric current. The City does not guarantee a constant or uninterrupted flow of current and will not assume responsibility for damages caused by fluctuations or interruptions, unless caused by the negligence of the City or its employees. The City will use reasonable diligence to provide adequate and uninterrupted supply of electrical energy at normal voltage, but if the supply shall be interrupted without notice for any cause, the City shall not be liable for personal injuries, loss or damages resulting therefrom, nor will such failure constitute a breach of any express or implied warranties or the agreement for service.

B.    In submitting an application for service or using the City’s electrical service, the customer agrees that he/she will make no claims and seek no damages from the City for damages caused by fluctuations or interruptions in the flow of electric current, unless that fluctuation or interruption was caused by the negligence of the City or its employees. The customer agrees that the City’s liability for damages is limited as provided herein.

C.    The City shall have the right to suspend temporarily the delivery of electric energy for the purpose of making repairs or improvements to its system. In all such cases, reasonable notice will be given to the customer and the repairs or improvements will be conducted as rapidly as may be practicable. If practicable, the work will be conducted at such time as will cause the least inconvenience to the customers. However, the City shall not be liable for damages or injuries caused by such interruptions or by the customer’s failure to receive notice of the interruption. (Ord. 957, §1, adopted 1995)


§4022 CUSTOMER POWER OUTAGE

If the customer’s service fails, the customer shall endeavor to determine if customer owned equipment, protection devices or wiring is cause for the failure before contacting the City. At the customer’s request, the City will dispatch a service person to check and repair City-owned equipment to the designated service point, at no charge. Any failure of customer-owned equipment, protection devices or wiring is the responsibility of the customer. (Ord. 957, §1, adopted 1995)

Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, ownership and use of premises that may be a source of pollutants such as parking lots, gasoline stations, industrial facilities, business enterprises, and dwelling units.

B.    Any construction contractor performing work in the city shall implement appropriate best management practices to prevent the discharge of construction wastes or debris or contaminants from construction materials, tools, and equipment from entering the stormwater system.

C.    Persons owning, operating, or maintaining a paved parking lot, the paved areas of a gas station, a paved private street, road, or driveway and related stormwater systems shall clean those structures as frequently and thoroughly as practicable in a manner that does not result in discharge of pollutants to the stormwater system.

D.    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property reasonably free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. The owner or lessee shall not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary for maintenance, nor remove said vegetation in such a manner as to increase the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is within his or her property lines in order to protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse originating or contributed from their property.

E.    The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant, the owner or proprietor of any real property in the city in front of which there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain that portion of the sidewalk in front of the property free of dirt or litter to the maximum extent practicable.

Business activities which may require a stormwater pollution prevention plan include, but are not limited to, maintenance, storage, manufacturing, assembly, equipment operations, vehicle loading or fueling, or cleanup procedures which are carried out partially or wholly out of doors.

I.    The city manager may adopt requirements identifying appropriate best management practices to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation, transport and discharge of pollutants. The city shall incorporate such requirements in any land use entitlement and construction or building related permit to be issued relative to such development or redevelopment.

Pursuant to section 1906 of the California Health and Safety Code, all Health Department personnel and peace officers shall carry out the provisions of this Chapter pertaining to rabies control.

The Division of Animal Control is empowered and authorized to assist, cooperate and enforce this Article.

Any peace officer, including properly designated contract agency or Animal Control officials, or public health official shall have the right to examine and enter upon all private premises as provided for in Health and Safety Code section 1908 for the enforcement of this Chapter as the same now exists or may subsequently be amended. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991)


§4171 ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL

A.    Harboring Unvaccinated Dogs: No person shall own or harbor any dog after such dog attains the age of four (4) months which has not been vaccinated by a duly licensed veterinarian.

B.    Certificate of Vaccination: After vaccinating any dog, the veterinarian performing such vaccination shall sign a certificate in triplicate containing the following information:

1. The name and address of the owner or harborer of the vaccinated dog.

2. The date of expiration of the vaccination.

3. The breed, color, sex and approximate size.

The Finance Department or the Division of Animal Control shall not issue license tags for any dog until it has been vaccinated with an antirabies vaccine by a licensed veterinarian in a manner approved by the County Health Officer. The owner of such dog shall exhibit to the Finance Department or the Division of Animal Control or the City a certificate of vaccination on the form provided by the Health Officer.

Every licensed veterinarian practicing veterinary medicine within the City shall submit to the Division of Animal Control or the City one copy of each rabies vaccination certificate issued. Copies of all certificates issued shall be submitted on a quarterly basis.

The Division of Animal Control shall retain and file its copy of the certificate for a period of no less than three (3) years.

C.    Exemption from Rabies Vaccination: Any dog may be exempted from antirabies vaccination during an illness or when the dog is not in physical condition to be vaccinated and the antirabies vaccination would be detrimental for a physiological reason to such dog’s health if a licensed veterinarian has examined the dog and certified in writing within five (5) days of examination that such vaccination should be postponed because of a specified illness.

A.    Impoundment by Public Officers: Any Animal Control Officer or peace officer may impound any animal when the officer deems it necessary in the interest of public health and safety or to prevent needless suffering of any animal.

B.    Citizen Impoundment: Any person who finds any animal which has estrayed or is running at large upon their property or any public place in violation of this Chapter, may take possession of and hold the same; provided, however, that the person shall be obligated to notify the Division of Animal Control within twenty four (24) hours of securing possession or control of the animal and give the Division of Animal Control complete information regarding the impoundment and shall surrender the animal to the Animal Control Officer upon demand. The taker-up shall provide adequate, safe and proper care to the animal in conformance with the provisions of Penal Code sections 597, 597a, 597e and 597f.

The notice shall state the following: that the dog has been impounded, where the dog is being held, the name, address, and telephone number of the agency or person to be contacted regarding the release of the dog, and an indication of the ultimate disposition of the dog, if no action to regain it is taken within a specified period of time by its owner or by the person who has a right to control the dog.

This Section shall not be construed as prohibiting any person from killing a dog in the situation authorized by Food and Agricultural Code sections 31102, 31104, 31152. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991)


§4183 SUMMARY SEIZURE AND POST SEIZURE HEARING

An Animal Control Officer may seize and impound an animal for violation of any provision of this article or State law prior to a hearing in any of the following situations where the owner is not present and where the officer believes it is necessary:

A.    To protect public health, safety and property;

B.    To protect an animal which is injured, sick, or starving and must be cared for; and

C.    To protect an animal from injury which has strayed into public property or public right-of-way.

D.    Even when the owner is present where the animal has bitten a human being and the officer reasonably believes that the owner will remove the animal from the City before it has been quarantined as provided in sections 4171 and 4172 of this code. The Animal Control Officer may quarantine the animal as provided in said sections.

If the owner or person who has the right to control the animal wishes to challenge the impoundment, he/she shall personally deliver or mail a written request for a hearing, such that it is received by Animal Control within seventy-two (72) hours of the seizure and impoundment.

Animal Control, upon receipt of a notice of appeal, shall immediately set a time, date and place for a hearing on said matter before the Hearing Officer appointed by the City Council to hear and decide such appeals. Said hearing shall be held not less than five (5) nor more than ten (10) days after the filing of the notice of appeal. Notice of such hearing shall immediately be given to the owner at the address shown in the notice of appeal. During the pendency of any appeal from an order of impoundment or abatement, the animal impounded may be maintained in the City impound facility or other approved facilities.

The hearing shall be conducted as set forth in section 4185 of this code. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991; Ord. 1169, §2, adopted 2016)


§4184 HEARING PRIOR TO ANIMAL DEPRIVATION

Except as provided in section 4182 of this code, a peace officer, agents of the Department of Public Health and the Division of Animal Control may not seize or impound any animal, unless an appeal hearing is held as set forth in section 4185 of this code.

If the owner or person who has a right to control an animal refuses to consent to an impoundment of his/her animal, the Animal Control Officer may issue a notice commanding the person to appear at a specified time before the Hearing Officer. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991; Ord. 1169, §2, adopted 2016)


§4185 APPEAL HEARING

At the time, date and place set for said hearing, the Hearing Officer(s) shall hold a hearing at which time the aggrieved owner of the subject animal may appear and testify as to any matters relevant to the proceedings. The Animal Control Officer, County Health Officer, or police officer shall present all evidence, oral and documentary, justifying said order of seizure and impoundment or abatement. Each party may be represented and may call such witnesses as shall be necessary to present testimony on matters relevant to the hearing. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to said proceedings, and the Hearing Officer(s) may hear and consider any evidence he or she deems relevant and upon which reasonable people would be likely to rely in the consideration of matters of a serious nature. The decision of the Hearing Officer(s) shall be supported by the weight of evidence.

Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer(s) shall determine whether to sustain or overrule the Animal Control Officer, Health Department or Police Department’s order of seizure and impoundment or abatement.

If the order of seizure and impoundment or abatement is not appealed or if such order is sustained after a hearing, the animal seized shall not be released to the owner until the owner pays all fees, charges or costs of the impounding and care for such animal, and said animal owner signs a written promise to control said animal and to prevent said animal from trespassing, howling, barking or making other noises, or causing damage to property, or being vicious or demonstrating that it is potentially vicious or in any manner causing a public nuisance. If all fees, charges, fines, and penalties are not paid or the written promise to abate is not filed with five (5) days of the date that said order of abatement becomes final, the animal impounded shall be placed in a suitable home or humanely destroyed by the impounding agency.

If any seizure and impoundment or order of abatement is overruled by the Hearing Officer(s), the animal impounded shall be released forthwith and the City shall bear all costs and expenses of such impoundment. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to exempt any owner from any fines or penalties imposed by failure to have such animal duly and properly licensed or registered.

In the event any animal owner(s) is ordered to abate a nuisance and, as a result of that order of abatement, said owner fails to take appropriate action which results in the animal constituting such nuisance being impounded and placed in a suitable home or humanely destroyed by the impounding agency, the Hearing Officer(s) may, if a kennel owner is at fault, order that no further kennel license or permit be issued to such kennel licensee or pursuant to this chapter for any such period of time, not to exceed one year, as he, she or they may determine. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991; Ord. 1169, §2, adopted 2016)


§4186 FAILURE TO APPEAL IMPOUNDMENT

Any person who fails to appeal any seizure or impoundment or order of abatement by the Animal Control Officer, the Department of Health or the Police Department or their authorized agents will forfeit all rights of ownership and control of the animal to the Division of Animal Control. Final disposition of the animal shall be determined by the agency in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and State law.

A.    Redemption: Upon proper identification to the Division of Animal Control as the true owner or other person entitled to custody of an impounded dog, said person may redeem such dog.

The same dog being redeemed from impoundment for a second or third time offense shall be redeemed by none other than its actual owner.

No dog shall be redeemed without a valid rabies vaccination certificate, current valid dog license, payment of the fees or charges for impoundment, board and care, or veterinary services rendered.

No large domestic animal shall be redeemed without payment of fees or charges to cover impoundment, capture, or hauling and other expenses incurred in taking-up the animal.

The amount of such fees and charges shall be set by resolution of the City Council.

Any animal or dog impounded by an Animal Control Officer or peace officer into his patrol vehicle prior to being impounded at the animal shelter for reasons of violations of this Chapter, or for the health and safety of the animal, may be released to its owner, or the person entitled to custody upon proper identification by the Animal Control Officer at his/her discretion. However, a notice of warning or citation may be issued to the owner or other person entitled to custody. It is a misdemeanor for any person to remove any animal from the custody of the impounding officer without the express permission of the officer.

B.    Adoption/Sale: All dogs and cats adopted or sold from the City Animal Control Shelter shall be spayed or neutered within thirty (30) days of adoption or sale. An amount to cover the cost of spaying or neutering shall be deposited with the Division of Animal Control at the time the animal is obtained. This deposit will be returned when evidence that the animal has been spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian is presented. The amount of the deposit shall be set by resolution by the City Council. For animals too young to be spayed or neutered a period of time recommended by a veterinarian will be allowed, but in no case, over ten (10) months of age. Failure to comply will forfeit the deposit. Fees for adoption are set forth by resolution of the City Council.

All dogs and cats adopted or sold from nonprofit fee-exempt kennels shall be neutered or spayed within thirty (30) days of adoption or sale. For animals too young to be spayed or neutered, a period of time recommended by a veterinarian will be allowed, but in no case over ten (10) months of age.

It is a misdemeanor for any person to give false or misleading information to the Division of Animal Control in the adoption of an animal that has been impounded for violation of this Chapter in order to avoid impoundment, boarding care fees or penalties for such violations, if it should be established the adoptee is, in fact, the true owner of the animal being adopted.

As a condition of adoption, the adoptee shall sign a notice agreeing to the provision for adoption that any person adopting any dog or cat from the animal shelter who fails to provide proper and adequate care in accordance with the Penal Code section 597(a) through (t), repeatedly allows the dog to be at large, or fails to obtain required vaccination and license in the case of dogs, or fails to spay or neuter the dog or cat as required, or said animal becomes a nuisance and is in three (3) repeated violations of this Chapter, shall be prohibited from any further adoption of animals from any animal shelter. In addition, said animal shall be taken-up and impounded and not returned to the adoptee. Said adoptee shall forthwith forfeit any right or title to said animal which will then become the property of the City. Adoptee may be subject to any fees, charges, penalties or citations. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991)


§4187 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED ANIMALS

No dog may be disposed of until seventy two (72) hours have elapsed from the time of impoundment, exclusive of the days of impoundment that the impoundment facility is closed, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

No stray cat which has been impounded by a public pound, society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, shelter, or humane shelter shall be disposed of before seventy two (72) hours have elapsed from the time of capture of the stray cat, exclusive of the days of that the impoundment facility is closed, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

This Section shall not apply to cats which are severely injured or seriously ill, or to newborn cats unable to feed themselves.

The Division of Animal Control may retain any dog, cat or animal under a protective custody hold beyond the seventy two (72) hour period at no charge to the owner.

In lieu of destruction, any dog or cat, at the discretion of the Division of Animal Control, may be released without charge to any humane organization that proves an animal adoption service providing such release or adoption is not in conflict with any provision of this Chapter. Any dog or cat may be returned to the Division of Animal Control without charge should such agency be unable to provide adoption for said animal. (Ord. 923, §2, adopted 1991)

A.    Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in nonsmokers.

B.    Health hazards induced by breathing environmental tobacco smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm.

C.    The American Medical Association, former U.S. Surgeon Generals C.

D.    Based on the weight of available scientific evidence, the U.S. Environmental Protection agency (EPA) has concluded that the widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the United States presents a serious and substantial public health impact.

E.    The purposes of this Chapter are to:

1. Protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment;

The policy shall be endorsed to prohibit cancellation or nonrenewal without providing the city with thirty (30) days’ prior written notice thereof.

A material variation includes, but is not limited to, a different aircraft, aircraft fuel servicing vehicle, vehicle operator or person performing fueling operations than what is stated in the application information. The airport manager may allow temporary variations from the application information while a request for a variation is pending, on a case by case basis.

F.    Nontransferable; Term Of Permit: A self-fueling permit is not assignable or transferable and is issued for a term of one year.

ENCROACHMENT: Includes any structure or object of any kind or character placed, without the authority of law, either in, under or over any public right of way, including vehicles or equipment designed to operate from a fixed or stationary position.

PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY: Includes all or any part of the entire width of a right of way granted to the city, whether in fee or as an easement, for sidewalk, highway, roadway, drainage, utility or other public purposes, whether or not such entire area is actually used for such purposes.

§5601 NOTICE TO REMOVE

If any encroachment exists in, under or over any public right of way, and is not encroaching in accordance with article 2 of this chapter, the city may require the removal of such encroachment in the manner provided in this chapter.

Notice shall be given to the owner, occupant or person in possession of the encroachment, or to any other person causing or suffering the encroachment to exist, by serving upon any such person a notice containing a demand for the immediate removal of such encroachment from within such public right of way. Any such notice shall describe the encroachment complained of with reasonable certainty as to its character and location.

The notice shall state that the encroachment must be permanently removed from the public right of way within five (5) days from the date of the notice. If not removed within said five (5) days, city personnel will remove the encroachment. The costs of its removal and its storage or other disposition shall be imposed on the recipient of the notice. If the recipient disputes the city’s right to remove the encroachment, he or she must, within the same five (5) day period, file a written protest with the city manager. The city manager’s decision shall be rendered within two (2) days of its receipt and shall be final for the city.

B.    Obstructs or prevents the use of such right of way by the public and presents a hazard that cannot be allowed to continue for a period of five (5) days; or

C.    Consists of refuse; or

D.    The ownership of which cannot be readily determined.

Upon such removal, the city, at its option, may: 1) return the encroachment to its owner, 2) store it at the owner’s expense, in which case the city shall have a lien on the encroachment equal to its reasonable storage costs, or 3) dispose of it in any other manner it deems appropriate.

§5610 AUTHORIZED

The city engineer, acting as the superintendent of streets, is hereby authorized to issue encroachment permits to authorize temporary encroachments within the public right of way, subject to the provisions of this article. (Ord. 1107, §1, adopted 2008)


§5611 APPLICATIONS

Any person, business or entity which proposes to encroach on the public right of way may apply for an encroachment permit, provided that the applicant has sufficient capacity and control over the encroachment to comply with any permit conditions imposed by the city engineer pursuant to section 5612 of this article. The city engineer is authorized to determine whether an applicant demonstrates such capacity and control. The applicant shall use an application form adopted by the city engineer, which may require the applicant to sign an agreement to comply with any conditions imposed pursuant to section 5612 of this article.

The city engineer may adopt such written procedures as he or she deems appropriate governing the application for and the issuance of encroachment permits, provided that those procedures do not conflict with this article.

The city engineer may charge a fee to accept and process an application for an encroachment permit. The amount of the fee shall be fixed by a resolution adopted by the city council. The city council may revise the fee from time to time to account for inflation and to assure that the fee equals, but does not exceed, the city’s actual costs associated with processing the application and regulating the activity authorized by the permit. (Ord. 1107, §1, adopted 2008)


§5612 CONDITIONS

The city engineer may impose such conditions as he or she deems appropriate and which are reasonable to protect the health, safety and property of the city and the general public. At a minimum, the permit shall require the permittee to indemnify and defend the city against any damage to persons or property, including public property, arising out of the activity authorized by the permit and to furnish such certificates of insurance and policy endorsements as are determined by the city engineer to evidence adequate insurance coverage to protect the city and the general public from the risks reasonably associated with the activity authorized by the permit. (Ord. 1107, §1, adopted 2008)


§5613 APPEALS

An applicant for a permit who objects to any condition or determination of the city engineer may appeal that decision to an appeals board consisting of the city manager and two (2) members of the city council appointed to the board by the city council. The applicant waives his or her right to an appeal unless he or she files a written request for an appeal with the city clerk within ten (10) days of the date he or she received written notice of the decision or determination he or she wants to appeal. To avoid a waiver of the right of appeal, the written request must adequately describe the decision or determination, the reasons why the applicant objects to it, and the remedy sought.

The board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal within ten (10) days after the city clerk receives the appeal. The city manager, in consultation with the other board members, may extend the hearing date for good cause. The board shall electronically record the hearing and preserve the recording for not less than one hundred twenty (120) days. The board may adopt such rules to govern its conduct of the hearing as it deems appropriate, provided that the applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argument to the board and the board announces its decision to the applicant either orally or in writing. The city engineer shall have an opportunity to present evidence and argument during the hearing. The board shall have discretion to refer the appeal to the city council rather than decide the appeal itself, in which event the city council shall consider the appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting that takes place not less than ten (10) days from the date of the referral, unless the city council extends the meeting date for good cause.

A decision by the board or the city council shall be based exclusively on the evidence and argument submitted during the hearings and the decision shall be final for the city. (Ord. 1107, §1, adopted 2008)

§5700 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

The City Council adopts the ordinance codified in this chapter based upon the following findings:

A.    In 1970, Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") which, among other things, makes it illegal to import, manufacture, distribute, possess or use marijuana in the United States.

B.    In 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215, or the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, codified at Health and Safety Code section 11362.5 et seq. (the "Act").

C.    The Act creates a limited exception from criminal liability for seriously ill persons who are in need of medical marijuana for specified medical purposes and who obtain and use medical marijuana under limited, specified circumstances.

D.    On January 1, 2004, SB 420 went into effect. SB 420, codified as Health and Safety Code sections 11362.7 through 11362.83 and known as the "Medical Marijuana Program" ("MMP"), was enacted by the State Legislature to clarify the scope of the act and to allow cities and other governing bodies to adopt and enforce rules and regulations consistent with SB 420.

E.    After the enactment of the MMP and in response to the MMP’s explicit reservation of local authority to regulate medical marijuana cultivation and distribution, the City Council took legislative notice of the fact that California cities and counties that had permitted the establishment of medical marijuana dispensaries had experienced serious adverse impacts associated with and resulting from such dispensaries, including an increase in crime, including burglaries, robberies, violence, illegal sales of marijuana, use of marijuana by minors and other persons without medical need in the areas immediately surrounding such medical marijuana dispensaries; and malodorous smells, indoor fire hazards, mold, fungus, and pests caused by indoor cultivation at dispensaries.

F.    To address these potential adverse impacts, in 2007, the City Council enacted Ordinance 1095, §1 ("Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Ordinance"), which prohibited and declared a public nuisance medical marijuana dispensaries in the City of Ukiah.

G.    The 2007 Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Ordinance also states that the City Council’s intention is to prohibit the operation and location of dispensaries in the City "until such time as their legality is clearly established and a proposal can be developed that would satisfy the City Council that the facility could operate without causing [serious adverse impacts]."

H.    On October 9, 2015, the Governor signed into law AB 266, AB 243, and SB 643, which together comprise the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act ("MMRSA"). The MMRSA, which went into effect on January 1, 2016, created a Statewide regulatory structure for the medical marijuana industry that also allows local governments to regulate the operation of marijuana businesses within their jurisdiction, pursuant to local ordinances. Specifically, the MMRSA allows the City of Ukiah to issue permits or licenses to operate marijuana businesses or prohibit their operation, to regulate or expressly prohibit the delivery of medical marijuana within its boundaries, and to regulate or expressly prohibit the cultivation of marijuana within its boundaries. Pursuant to the MMRSA, if the City opts not to expressly prohibit or regulate the cultivation, processing, delivery, and/or dispensing of medical marijuana, the State will be the sole licensing authority for these activities in the City.

I.    In order to maintain local control over the regulation of commercial cannabis activities in the City, in 2017, the City Council enacted Ordinance 1176, ("Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Ordinance II"), which regulates the operation of and sets forth a local permitting process for medical marijuana dispensaries in the City of Ukiah.

J.    On November 9, 2016, the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act ("AUMA" or "Proposition 64") to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in California for individuals twenty-one (21) years of age and older was approved by the voters of the State of California.

K.    In June of 2017, the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 94, which was signed by the Governor and went into effect immediately, and which repealed MMRSA entirely and merged certain portions of that law with AUMA to create a more comprehensive regulatory structure for both medical and recreational marijuana.

L.    The new comprehensive regulatory system created by Senate Bill 94, intended to regulate all commercial cannabis uses in the State, is called the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act ("MAUCRSA").

M.    The Act, MMP, AUMA, and MAUCRSA do not prevent a city from using its constitutional authority to enact nuisance, health and safety, and land use regulations regarding dispensaries or other commercial cannabis uses.

N.    The City Council believes that a regulated environment for commercial cannabis is preferable to an unregulated black market and, as such, desires to regulate all commercial cannabis businesses operating in the City of Ukiah, including cannabis retailers that sell cannabis for nonmedical use, in a manner that mitigates potential negative impacts, prevents cannabis from reaching minors or the illicit market, preserves public health and safety, protects the environment, provides diverse economic opportunities, and implements the City’s General Plan.

O.    To protect the public health, safety, and welfare, it is the desire of the City Council to modify the City Code consistent with the MMP, the AUMA, and the MAUCRSA, regarding the location and operation of cannabis dispensaries, delivery of cannabis within the boundaries of the City, regulation of cannabis-related special events, and cultivation of cannabis within the boundaries of the City.

P.    There have been a number of marijuana dispensing-related incidents in California, some including acts of violence.

Q.    The City Council finds that cannabis dispensing which exceeds the limitations set forth in these regulations will likely result in an unreasonable risk of crime and other adverse impacts and will likely create offensive odors to persons living nearby.

R.    It is the City Council’s intention that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to (1) allow persons to engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance; (2) allow the illegal use of cannabis, particularly the use of cannabis by minors who are not qualified patients; or (3) allow any activity relating to the distribution or consumption of cannabis that is otherwise illegal.

S.    This chapter provides the development, operating, and permit standards for all commercial, retail cannabis uses to ensure neighborhood compatibility, minimize potential environmental impacts, mitigate potential nuisances, provide safe access to cannabis and provide opportunities for economic development.

T.    This chapter is compatible with the general objectives of the General Plan, in that a cannabis dispensary use will be conditionally permitted in commercial and industrial districts, being similar to other permitted and conditionally permitted uses, such as pharmacies and medical clinics in the case of medical cannabis dispensaries and bars or cocktail lounges in the case of dispensaries serving adult use patrons, and in that the use will be subject to strict permit conditions and rigorous review.

U.    This chapter will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare or adversely affect the orderly development of property, because the uses permitted under this chapter will be subject to careful review, limited in scope and location, and subject to strict operating requirements, avoiding or limiting potential negative effects.

V.    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate cannabis dispensaries in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of residents and businesses within the City. (Ord. 1095, §1, adopted 2007; Ord. 1176, §1, adopted 2017; Ord. 1188, §1, adopted 2018)


§5701 INTERPRETATION AND APPLICABILITY

A.    This chapter is not intended to create a positive conflict with the CSA, but rather to implement the AUMA, the MAUCRSA, and related State laws.

B.    Nothing in this chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed, to exempt any marijuana-related activity from any and all applicable local and State construction, electrical, plumbing, land use, or any other building, fire, or land use standards or permitting requirements.

C.    Nothing in this chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed, to make legal any cultivation, transportation, sale, or other use of marijuana that is otherwise prohibited under California law.

D.    All retail sales and delivery of cannabis within City limits shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter, even if the retail sales and delivery existed or occurred prior to adoption of this chapter.

E.    Nothing in this chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed, to allow or permit any "commercial cannabis activity," as defined in Business and Professions Code section 26001(k) or as may be amended, or any commercial or noncommercial activity involving marijuana use for any purpose that is not otherwise authorized in the Ukiah City Code. (Ord. 1176, §1, adopted 2017; Ord. 1182, §1, adopted 2017; Ord. 1188, §1, adopted 2018)

§5703 DISPENSARY USE PERMIT REQUIRED TO OPERATE

A.    It is unlawful for any person to engage in, conduct or carry on, or to permit to be engaged in, conducted or carried on, in or upon any premises in the City the operation of a cannabis retail business unless the person first obtains and continues to maintain in full force and effect a dispensary use permit from the City as required in this chapter.

The City recognizes that State law requires dual licensing at the State and local level for all cannabis businesses (medical and adult use). All cannabis retailers shall therefore be required to diligently pursue and obtain a State cannabis license and shall comply at all times with all applicable State licensing requirements and conditions, including, but not limited to, operational standards such as, by way of illustration but not limitation, background checks, prior felony convictions, restrictions on multiple licenses and license types, and locational criteria.

Failure to demonstrate dual licensing in accordance with this chapter and within any deadlines established by State law shall be grounds for revocation of City approval. Revocation of a local dispensary use permit and/or a State license shall terminate the ability of the cannabis retailer to operate until a new permit and/or State license is obtained.

C.    The grant of a dispensary use permit by the City shall not create an entitlement or vested right in the permittee to any permit or license to operate any other commercial cannabis businesses. (Ord. 1176, §1, adopted 2017; Ord. 1188, §1, adopted 2018)


§5704 TERM OF PERMITS AND RENEWALS REQUIRED

A.    Dispensary use permits issued under this chapter shall expire one year following the date of their issuance which date shall appear on the face of the permit.

B.    Dispensary use permits may be renewed by the Zoning Administrator for additional one-year periods upon application by the permittee, unless the permit is suspended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

C.    Applications for renewal shall be made at least forty-five (45) days before the expiration date of the permit and shall be accompanied by the nonrefundable application fee referenced in section 5706 of this code and all information necessary for the Zoning Administrator to evaluate the renewal request in light of the criteria listed in subsection F of this section. In acting on an application for renewal, the Zoning Administrator shall follow the procedures set forth in subsections 5711B and C of this code, except that all references therein to the Planning Commission shall be deemed to refer to the Zoning Administrator. Upon timely application to renew a permit, the permit being renewed shall remain in effect until final action is taken to grant or deny the renewal application.

D.    Applications for renewal made less than forty-five (45) days before the expiration date shall be processed in the same manner as a timely renewal application but shall not stay the expiration date of the permit.

E.    Renewal applications shall be subject to duly noticed public hearings in accordance to the procedures set forth for minor use permit applications in section 9262 of this code.

F.    In determining whether to renew a dispensary use permit, the Zoning Administrator will consider the following nonexclusive criteria, in addition to those criteria set forth in this chapter at section 5710 of this code:

1. Whether the dispensary operated by the permittee has generated an excessive number of calls for police service compared to similarly situated businesses of the same size as the dispensary.

2. Whether there have been excessive secondary criminal or public nuisance impacts in the surrounding area or neighborhood, including, but not limited to, disturbances of the peace, illegal drug activity, marijuana use in public, harassment of passersby, littering, loitering, illegal parking, loud noises, or lewd conduct.

3. Whether the dispensary operated by the permittee has a history of inadequate safeguards or procedures that show it is likely that it will not comply with the operating requirements and standards in this chapter.

4. Whether the dispensary has failed to pay fees, penalties, or taxes required by this code or has failed to comply with the production of records or other reporting requirements of this chapter.

5. Whether it appears that the permittee has, in its renewal application, provided a false statement of material fact or has knowingly omitted a material fact.

6. Whether the renewal applicant or one or more of its officers, employees, partners, managers or members with management responsibilities ("managers") has been convicted of a felony, or has engaged in misconduct that is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of a dispensary operator. A "conviction" within the meaning of this chapter means a plea or verdict of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere. Notwithstanding the above, an application shall not be denied solely on the basis that the applicant or any Manager has been convicted of a felony, if the person convicted has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation (expungement of felony record) under California law or under a similar Federal statute or State law where the expungement was granted.

7. Whether the renewal applicant or dispensary has previously or is currently engaged in unlawful, fraudulent, unfair, or deceptive business acts or practices.

G.    The Zoning Administrator shall make findings of fact and either grant, grant conditionally, or deny the application for renewal of a dispensary use permit. An applicant aggrieved by the Zoning Administrator’s decision to issue or to deny a dispensary use permit renewal may appeal such decision to the Planning Commission by filing an appeal. All determinations of the Zoning Administrator regarding dispensary use permit renewals shall be final unless a written appeal, stating the reasons for the appeal, and the appeal fee, if any, as established by resolution of the City Council from time to time, are filed with the Planning Department within ten (10) days of the date the decision was made. The appeal fee will be in addition to the nonrefundable renewal application fee. Appeals may be filed by an applicant.

The Planning Commission shall conduct a duly noticed public hearing on the appeal in accordance to the applicable procedures as set forth in section 9266 of this code, except that all references therein to the City Council shall be deemed to refer to the Planning Commission. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning Commission may affirm, reverse, or modify the appealed decision of the Zoning Administrator. All Planning Commission decisions on appeals of the Zoning Administrator’s decision with regard to an application for a dispensary use permit renewal are final for the City. (Ord. 1176, §1, adopted 2017; Ord. 1188, §1, adopted 2018)

A.    Where such vehicle is being driven, ridden, or used upon property by the owner, resident or tenant of such property, or by an authorized visitor when such visitor is accompanied by or has a written authorization in his possession from the owner, resident or tenant of such property.

B.    Where such use is permitted pursuant to a use permit or otherwise in accordance with the zoning regulations of the City. (Ord. 692, §1, adopted 1977)

ARTICLE 7. PROHIBITION OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND DISPLAY OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA

SECTION:

§6070:    Purpose

§6071:    Definitions

§6072:    Display Of Drug Paraphernalia

§6073:    Distribution Of Drug Paraphernalia

§6074:    Penalties


§6070 PURPOSE

The illegal use of controlled substances within the city creates serious social, medical and law enforcement problems. The illegal use of such substances by persons under eighteen (18) years of age has reached crisis dimensions. It is causing serious physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community, an impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the educational system, increases in nondrug related crime, and a threat to the ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and productive adults – all to the detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

The proliferation of the display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores within the city, and the distribution of such paraphernalia, intensifies and otherwise compounds the problem of illegal use of controlled substances within this community.

A ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen (18) years of age would not be practical. The person who displays or distributes would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia. The already thin staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to intolerable added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution. A significant number of high school students are eighteen (18) years of age or older. It would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited. Permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use, making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth. The problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial, necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create.

This Article is a measure which is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the City. (Ord. 780, §1, adopted 1982; amd. by Ord. 787, §1, adopted 1982)

4. Specific conditions exist which particularly affect the subject property as opposed to other properties in the District similarly situated;

A.    Permits Issued On A Periodic Basis: Permits may be issued on a monthly, semi-annual, annual or other periodic basis as determined by the Finance Director.

B.    Issuance And Cancellation Of Right To Permit: The Finance Director shall determine the number of permits available for each Municipal parking lot or assigned space. The City shall maintain a list of permit applicants based on the date it received the request or application for a permit. Permits shall be issued on a first come, first served basis. Once an applicant receives a permit, he or she shall continue to receive a permit for that lot or space either until he or she notifies the City that he or she no longer wants the permit, or if the applicant has failed to pay a permit fee within thirty (30) days of the payment date. If an applicant forfeits the right to receive a permit as provided herein, the City shall issue the permit to the next applicant on the list. An applicant removed from the list under this subsection is not prohibited from requesting another permit for the same or a different lot or space, but his or her name shall appear on the list based on the most recent date of request or application.

D.    Payment Of Fees And Validity Of Permits: Permits may be issued in advance and become effective upon payment by an established payment date of the required periodic fee, including amounts owing for prior periods, or may be issued only upon payment of the required fee.

1. If issued in advance, the permit shall indicate on its face that it is not valid, unless the total balance owing, including fees owing for prior periods, is paid in full by the payment date shown on the permit. "Paid in full" means that the payment has been received by the City Finance Department. If paid by check, the check must have cleared. The canceled check is the permittee’s proof of the fact and date of payment. Such a permit that has not been paid in full is not a valid City parking permit. The City may refuse to provide an advance permit to any permittee with a balance owing for a prior period.

2. If issued only upon payment, the City shall stamp the permit as "Valid – Paid in Full". Such a permit not bearing the required stamp is not a valid City parking permit. Any permit bearing such a stamp shall become void immediately without notice to the permittee, if the permittee pays by check and the check is returned unpaid by the bank. The Finance Department shall endeavor to notify permittees when checks bounce, but its failure to do so shall not affect the invalidity of the permit. A permit may be reinstated upon full payment of all fees and costs owing.

E.    Contents Of Permit: The permit shall contain the following information:

1. Name of parking lot for which permit is issued;

2. Space number, if issued for a specific space;

3. Time period for which permit is effective;

4. The total amount which must be paid for the permit to be valid;

The permit must be properly displayed. "Properly displayed" means displayed face up on the driver’s side of the dashboard and clearly visible through the vehicle’s windshield.

1. A vehicle with a properly displayed valid City parking permit issued for a Municipal parking lot may park within that lot in a metered space in lieu of paying the parking meter fees and without regard to parking time or in a space posted for "permit parking only".

2. In the discretion of the Director of Finance permits may be issued for assigned spaces.

3. It shall be unlawful for any vehicle not properly displaying a valid parking permit to park in a space posted for "permit parking only". If permits are issued for assigned parking spaces, it shall be unlawful for any vehicle not properly displaying a valid parking permit for that assigned space to park in a space posted for "assigned permit parking only".

This chapter prescribes the procedures for the preparation, filing, processing, and approval or denial of lot line adjustments consistent with the policies of the General Plan, the requirements of this code, and the requirements of Government Code section 66412(d), part of the California Subdivision Map Act ("Map Act"). This chapter also prescribes the procedures for voluntary parcel mergers. (Ord. 1138, §2 (Exh. A), adopted 2012)


§8295 APPLICABILITY

As provided by Map Act section 66412(d), the lot line adjustment procedure is for the purpose of relocating lot lines between four (4) or fewer existing adjoining parcels where the land taken from one parcel is added to an adjoining parcel and where a greater number of parcels than originally existed is not created. For the purpose of this chapter, "adjoining" means touching. (Ord. 1138, §2 (Exh. A), adopted 2012)


§8296 APPLICATION AND PROCESSING

A lot line adjustment application shall be prepared, filed, and processed as prescribed by this section.

A.    Application Submittal And Contents: A lot line adjustment application shall include a completed application form and all information and other materials required by the Public Works Department and shall be filed with the City Planning Department.

C.    Application Review: City staff shall review the application for completeness and accuracy. The application may be referred to any City department or any public agency that may be affected or have an interest in the proposed lot line adjustment.

D.    Environmental Review: A lot line adjustment is considered a ministerial project and for that reason is not subject to environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). See Pub. Resources Code section 21080, subds. (a), (b)(1) and Sierra Club v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (Cal. App. 1st Dist. 2012) 205 Cal. App. 4th 162. 

E.    Public Notice: No public notice is required as the lot line adjustment application is a ministerial action. 

F.    Concurrent Permit Processing: When a lot line adjustment is part of a project that requires one or more discretionary planning entitlements and the applicant does not want the lot line adjustment unless the entire project is approved, then the lot line adjustment shall be reviewed as part of the discretionary planning application. In that event, all permits and approvals, including the lot line adjustment, shall be combined into one application, processed concurrently, and acted upon by the highest review authority required by this code based on the entitlements included in the application.

The City Engineer may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the lot line adjustment in compliance with this section. 

A.    Required Findings: A proposed lot line adjustment shall be approved if the City Engineer finds all of the following:

1. The adjustment will not create a greater number of parcels than existed prior to the adjustment;

2. The adjustment will not result in an increase in the number of nonconforming parcels; 

3. The adjustment will not increase the nonconformity of any parcel; and 

4. All of the parcels resulting from the adjustment are consistent with the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and Building Code. 

B.    Conditions Of Approval: In approving a lot line adjustment, the City Engineer shall adopt conditions only as necessary to conform the adjustment and proposed parcels to the requirements of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Building Code or to facilitate the relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure, or easements.

C.    Appeal: The decision of the City Engineer may be appealed to the City Council. Said appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date of the decision, shall state the reason(s) for the appeal, and be accompanied by the appeal fee, if any, established by the City Council from time to time by resolution; provided, however, that the City Council decision on the appeal is subject to the provisions of this section regarding findings and conditions of approval. (Ord. 1138, §2 (Exh. A), adopted 2012)


§8298 COMPLETION OF ADJUSTMENT

Within twelve (12) months after approval, the lot line adjustment process shall be completed in compliance with this section through the recordation of a deed, after all conditions of approval have been satisfied. 

A.    Completion By Deed: A lot line adjustment shall not be considered complete or become effective until recordation in the official records of Mendocino County of a grant deed or deeds signed by the record owners. Prior to recordation, the applicant shall submit deeds to the City Engineer for review and approval in compliance with subsection B of this section, and shall pay the review fees. The legal descriptions provided in the deeds, including an accompanying plat, shall be prepared by a qualified registered civil engineer, or a land surveyor licensed or registered in the state in accordance with state law and shall be accompanied by a preliminary title report prepared within fifteen (15) days of the date of submission by a title company approved by the City Engineer.

B.    Review And Approval By The City Engineer: The City Engineer shall:

1. Examine the deeds to ensure that all record title owners and lien holders have consented to the adjustment;

2. Verify that all conditions of approval have been satisfactorily completed and that the deeds are in substantial compliance with the lot line adjustment as approved by the review authority; 

3. Verify that the property owners have obtained partial reconveyances from any mortgagor or other lien holder for any portion of a parcel being transferred to an adjacent parcel and that any liens covering the adjacent property have been modified to cover the newly created larger parcel;

4. If satisfied that the deeds comply with the above requirements, place an endorsed approval upon the deeds; and 

5. After approval of the legal description, assemble the deeds and return them to the applicant's title company for recordation.

C.    Expiration: The approval of a lot line adjustment shall expire and become void if the adjustment has not been completed as required by this section within twelve (12) months of approval. (Ord. 1138, §2 (Exh. A), adopted 2012)

A.    Such lots shall have a minimum net area of five thousand (5,000) square feet in each building site, excluding any portion of such site with a substandard lot width that is extended to a dedicated street for purposes of access or other purposes ("flag lot") or is burdened by an easement to another parcel for access or other purposes.

 

B.    Easements in a form satisfactory to the city engineer shall benefit each lot in the proposed subdivision that requires private access to a dedicated street, the purposes of which shall include public utilities, drainage facilities, and the development of an access roadway between the dedicated street and the lots requiring access thereto ("the access easement"). The minimum width of the access easement shall be twenty feet (20’).

2. The surface for any access roadways between the dedicated street and lots created by the subdivision shall consist of a minimum of two inches (2") of asphaltic concrete over a minimum of six inches (6") of class II aggregate base material or other all weather surfacing materials which the city engineer determines will provide equivalent standards of accessibility and durability.

3. The area used for any access roadway between the dedicated street and lots created by the subdivision shall not be considered as part of any building site or be used as any required yard area for the purpose of determining the net area for any of the lots.

4. A building setback with a minimum width of five feet (5’) shall be maintained from the edge of pavement for any access roadway.

5. The property owner shall execute an agreement holding the city harmless from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and damages arising from the use of said access easement by himself or any other parties.

The documents also shall give the city authority to perform any maintenance work on the private roadway and such drainage structures located therein, if the owners of said lots, or their successors or assigns, fail to maintain the private roadway or drainage structures to the reasonable satisfaction of the city engineer, the costs thereof to constitute liens on said lots.

F.    A scale map shall be submitted with any application for a building permit and shall set forth the following:

§8400 PURPOSE

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by section 66477 of the Government Code of the state of California. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this Chapter are in accordance with the recreational element of the General Plan of the City, adopted by the City on August 21, 1974. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8401 REQUIREMENTS

As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the City, for park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this Article. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8402 GENERAL STANDARD

It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five (5) acres of property for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within this City be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8403 STANDARDS AND FORMULA FOR DEDICATION OF LAND

Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the City "Master Park and Recreation Plan", an element of the General Plan of the City, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following standards and formula:

The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows:

	Average number of persons/dwelling unit ÷	1,000 population

	 	park acreage standard

DU = Dwelling unit

	(Example for single-family DU: 3.6 ÷	1,000	= .018 ac./U)

	 	5	 

The following table of population density is to be followed:

	Park Land Dedication Formula Table

	Types of Dwelling	Acreage/DU	Average Density/DU

5 ac. std.

	Single-family	3.6	.0180

	Duplex and condominiums	3.1	.0155

	Apartments (tri-plexes and above)	1.8	.0090

(Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8404 FORMULA FOR FEES IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION

A.    General Formula: If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the City "Master Park and Recreation Plan", to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in §8403 hereof in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of §8406 hereof, such fee to be used for a park which will serve the residents of the area being subdivided.

B.    Fees in Lieu of Land; Fifty Parcels or Less: If the proposed subdivision contains fifty (50) parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in §8403 hereof and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of §8405 hereof.

C.    Use of Money: The money collected hereunder shall be used only for the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision by way of the purchase of necessary land or, if the City Council deems that there is sufficient land available for the subdivision, for improving such land for park and recreational purposes. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8405 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING BOTH DEDICATION AND FEE

In subdivisions of over fifty (50) lots, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula:

A.    When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the City "Master Park and Recreation Plan" as the site for a local park, such portion shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee, computed pursuant to the provisions of §8406 hereof, shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to §8403 hereof.

B.    When a major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired by the City and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee, computed pursuant to the provisions of §8406 hereof, shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to §8403 hereof, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing parks and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8406 AMOUNT OF FEE IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION

Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to §8403 hereof. The fair market value shall be determined at the time of filing the tentative map or parcel map. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8407 DETERMINATION OF LAND OR FEE

Whether the City Council accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:

A.    Recreational element of the City’s general plan;

B.    Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication.

C.    Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication;

D.    The feasibility of dedication;

E.    Compatibility of dedication within the City "Master Park and Recreation Plan"; and

F.    Availability of previously acquired park property.

The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8408 CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE

Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed fifty percent (50%), may be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the City Council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met:

A.    That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and

B.    That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance or restrictions; and

C.    That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City or its successor; and

D.    That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and

E.    That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the General Plan. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8409 PROCEDURE

At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the Planning Commission on the recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Commission shall determine pursuant to §8403 hereof the land to be dedicated and/or fees to be paid by the subdivider.

At the time of the filing of the final map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land/or pay the fees as previously determined by the Planning Commission.

The reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible. The reserved area shall conform to the adopted specific plan or General Plan and shall be in such multiples of street and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired within the prescribed period. (Ord. 682, §29, adopted 1976)


§8432 PROCEDURE

The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall, at the time of approval of the final map or parcel map, enter into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two (2) years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless such period of time is extended by mutual agreement.

R.    Any balcony, window or door of an ADU shall utilize techniques to lessen the privacy impacts onto adjacent properties. These techniques may include use of obscured glazing, window placement above eye level, or locating balconies, windows and doors toward the existing on-site primary residence. In addition, trees shall be planted and maintained in a viable condition by the property owner, where appropriate, to preserve the privacy of neighboring property owners.

    This requirement will not apply to an ADU that is contained within the existing space of a single-family or multifamily residence or accessory structure.

3. Whether the request would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city of Ukiah, or require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law.

4. Whether the request would pose impacts to surrounding uses.

5. Whether the request is based on the attributes of the property and structures.

6. Whether alternative reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit could be undertaken.

§9220 PURPOSE


§9220.1 PURPOSE

The purpose of the downtown zoning code is:

A.    To create an urban environment that implements and fulfills the goals, objectives and strategies of the Ukiah General Plan by encouraging the development of a healthy, safe, diverse, compact and walkable urban community.

B.    To implement the vision for the study area created by the community during an intense and open community design charette process in 2007. That vision is one of environmentally sustainable and economically vital public spaces and buildings with a renewed civic square, attractive civic buildings and spaces, a healthy creek corridor, gateways that reflect Ukiah’s sense of place, a mix of building types and affordability, new development that supports and enhances the train depot and rail corridor, interconnected and pedestrian-oriented public streets, specific locations for potential anchor buildings (such as large-scale retail, employment centers and parking structures), and pedestrian-friendly buildings and streetscapes.

C.    To manage the scale and general character of new development to emulate the best elements of Ukiah’s heritage, such as shady downtown streets, diverse architecture, mixed-use shopfront buildings in the downtown, and the architecture of historic civic buildings.

D.    To ensure that public and private spaces are connected and compatible. Buildings that line public spaces relate to the natural surroundings and character of the local built environment, and connect to one another at the pedestrian scale. Public spaces are more than streets and paths for people traveling on foot, on bicycles and in cars. They are the community gathering places. The character of these public spaces is defined by their design and detail, and by the way that private buildings connect to public spaces.

E.    To coordinate the design of public and private elements in a comprehensive and systematic approach. The downtown zoning district provides this system, focusing on the pedestrian experience as well as on the efficient movement of pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles.

F.    To facilitate the coexistence of a wide range of residential, commercial and similar uses in close proximity within a lively downtown urban environment.

G.    To preserve and enhance the historic downtown.

H.    To support local businesses and create a vibrant commercial downtown where buildings meet the street and activate a wide range of pedestrian-friendly uses.

I.    To promote and encourage a sustainable community through the reuse and improvement of existing buildings, infill development, green building and smart growth practices, and resource conservation (such as the enhancement of the creek corridor, tree planting, and tree preservation). (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 1.010), adopted 2012)


§9221 APPLICABILITY


§9221.1 APPLICABILITY

Proposed development, subdivisions, and new land uses within the downtown zoning code (DZC) shall comply with all of the applicable requirements of this article (downtown zoning code) as follows:

A.    Zoning Map: The Zoning Map shows the boundaries of the downtown zoning code, the zoning designations within this code, and identifies the specific parcels within each zone. The zoning designation determines the standards for building placement, design, and use.

B.    Building and Site Uses: The building and site uses in section 9223 of this code identify the land uses allowed by the City in each of the zones established on the Zoning Map. A parcel shall be occupied only by land uses identified as allowed within the applicable zone by section 9223 of this code, Building and Site Uses. Section 9224 of this code, Standards for Specific Land Uses, identifies standards that apply to specific land uses allowed by this code.

C.    Site and Building Development Standards: The site and building development standards in section 9225 of this code regulate the aspects of each private building and parcel of land that affect the public realm. The standards vary according to the zone applied to each parcel by the Zoning Map, Circulation Map, and Special Designations Map. The site and development standards regulate such things as the subdivision of land, building placement, and facade design.

D.    Architectural Standards: The architectural standards identified in section 9226 of this code regulate the required form of each private building.

E.    Historical Building Standards: The historical building standards in section 9227 of this code regulate modifications to buildings that are fifty (50) years or older.

F.    Parking Requirements and Design Standards: The parking standards and procedures in section 9228 of this code regulate the number of spaces, design, landscaping requirements, and location of required parking facilities.

G.    Tree Preservation and Planting Requirements: The tree preservation and planting procedures in section 9229 of this code regulate the preservation and retention of existing trees and the planting of new street trees, parking lot trees, and riparian trees.

H.    Circulation Standards: The circulation standards in section 9230 of this code regulate the design of streets, pedestrian and bike paths and other public ways within the boundaries of this code, including new thoroughfares and modifications to existing and extensions of existing thoroughfares. The Circulation Map (Figure 8) identifies existing and proposed new and/or modified circulation routes (e.g., streets, bike paths, and pedestrian ways).

I.    Special Designations: The Special Designations Map (Figure 9) identifies the required location of storefront frontage types, recommended location of storefront frontage types, recommended turret locations, and required terminated vista locations and is intended to ensure that development is consistent with the architectural and design purposes of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 2.010), adopted 2012)


§9221.2 RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING ORDINANCE

If a conflict occurs between a requirement of this article and the City of Ukiah zoning ordinance and subdivision ordinance (Chapter 1 of this division), the provisions of this article (downtown zoning code) shall apply. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 2.020), adopted 2012)


§9221.3 ADMINISTRATION

The standards of this article shall be administered as provided in section 9231 of this code, Administration and Procedures, and enforced as provided for in Chapter 2, Article 22 of this division, Interpretation, Enforcement Penalties and Legal Procedure. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 2.030), adopted 2012)


§9222 ZONING


§9222.1 APPLICABILITY

The regulations in section 9222 of this code, including the Zoning Map, apply to all proposed development within the boundaries of this code shown on the Zoning Map. No grading or building permit shall be issued and no discretionary entitlement shall be approved unless the proposed construction and land uses comply with this article.

A.    Zoning Districts: The Zoning Map (Figure 1) in this section establishes three (3) separate zoning districts within the downtown zoning code: General Urban (GU); Urban Center (UC); and Downtown Core (DC):

1. General Urban (GU) Zone: The GU Zone allows for mixed-use and urban residential uses in a wide range of building types, from single use and single-family to a mix of uses and multifamily. Setbacks and landscaping are variable. Streets define medium size blocks.

2. Urban Center (UC) Zone: The UC Zone allows for higher density residential and mixed-use buildings that may accommodate retail, office, services, local and regional civic uses, and residential uses. This zone has a tight network of streets with wide sidewalks, regularly spaced street tree planting, and buildings set close to lot frontages.

3. Downtown Core (DC) Zone: The DC Zone allows the highest density and intensity of development allowing a wide variety of commercial uses and residential uses located in mixed-use buildings. This zone has small, walkable blocks with regularly spaced street trees and buildings set at the frontage line.

B.    Special Designations: The Zoning Map (Figure 1), Circulation Map (Figure 8), and Special Designations Map (Figure 9) establish the following designations. The symbol for each designation is identified on the specific map.

1. Civic Space: Civic spaces are outdoor areas dedicated for public use. Civic spaces are defined by the relationship among certain physical elements, such as their intended use, size, landscaping, and buildings along the frontage line. Several types of civic spaces are described in Table 2: Civic Spaces, and shown in Figure 1 (Zoning Map). This code includes both existing civic spaces and the potential for the creation of new civic spaces as described below:

a. Existing (CE): Existing civic spaces within the DZC boundaries are shown on the Zoning Map. The allowed uses of parcels with the CE designation are determined by the zoning of the property (GU, UC, DC). The purpose of the CE designation is to identify the location of the existing civic spaces within the boundaries of this code. Existing civic spaces within the district include the Alex B. Thomas Plaza and Depot Park.

b. Preferred (CP): Preferred civic spaces within the district are shown on the Zoning Map. The allowed uses of the parcels with the CP designation are determined by the zoning of the property (GU, UC, DC). The purpose of the CP designation is to identify the preferred location of new civic space within the boundaries of this code and to provide specific recommendations for the following preferred civic spaces.

(1) Depot Area: This preferred civic space provides access to the historic depot and the rail trail corridor. The area currently includes a plaza along the Perkins Street frontage. The parcels in this area are undeveloped and large enough to accommodate large civic uses and spaces. Any future development shall maintain access to the rail trail corridor and depot. Future development should utilize architecture that is compatible with the historic depot, provide adequate pedestrian connections to the rail trail and depot, and expand the current plaza area.

(2) Gibson Creek Corridor: New civic spaces and the enhancement of existing spaces encompassing Gibson Creek, including currently covered segments, are recommended elements of this code. Use and development of parcels that abut Gibson Creek within the boundaries of this code are determined by the zoning of the parcel as shown on the Zoning Map. Any future development shall consider daylighting, re-establishing and providing public access to the creek corridor, or granting to the City a sixty-foot (60') right-of-way for the future daylighting, restoration and operation of a publicly accessible creek corridor in a location approximately as shown on the Circulation Map.

(3) West of Leslie Street to Railroad Right-of-Way (Railroad Depot Property): The area bounded by Leslie Street, Perkins Street and the railroad tracks includes several larger undeveloped parcels which provide an opportunity for a large civic facility in the form of a single or multiple civic buildings. Any such development should include civic space as described in Table 2 and as allowed in Table 3. The continuation of Hospital Drive into the site provides an opportunity for a terminated vista as shown on the Special Designations Map (Figure 9). The allowed uses and development standards are determined by the zoning of the property.

2. Public Parking – Existing (PE): These sites are intended to serve the general parking needs within the boundaries of this code and of the City at large and are shown on the Zoning Map as PE. The allowed uses are determined by the zoning of the property (GU, UC, DC). This designation has been applied to existing City-owned parking lots.

3. Parking Structure and/or Anchor Tenant Opportunity Sites – Preferred: These opportunity sites designated on the Zoning Map are recommended to be developed with a parking structure and/or medium or large retail use or a large employer with the potential to generate a significant number of pedestrians and thereby invigorate the area within and adjacent to the boundaries of this code. These sites are shown on the Zoning Map as PP. The allowed uses and development standards are determined by the zoning of the parcel (GU, UC, DC).

4. Flood Plain. The approximate location of the one hundred (100) year flood plain as shown on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) is included on the Zoning Map to provide general information. This is not a zoning designation. Parcels with this designation are subject to the requirements of this code and the City’s flood plain management regulations.

C.    Conflict with Other Regulations: The provisions of this article take precedence over those of conflicting codes, regulations and standards adopted by the City of Ukiah and other agencies to the extent allowed by law. In particular, this article (Downtown Zoning Code) supersedes Chapter 2, Articles 3 through Article 17 and Articles 20 and 21 of this code (Zoning), except as specifically referenced in this article. The provisions of this article shall not take precedence over:

1. Building regulations (Division 3 of this code).

2. Flood plain management regulations (California Building Code Appendix G).

3. Mendocino County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

D.    Frontage Improvements and Dedications: The developer shall construct frontage improvements and dedicate as required by the Ukiah City Code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 3.010), adopted 2012)

§9223 BUILDING AND SITE USES


§9223.1 APPLICABILITY

Parcels and buildings shall be occupied by only the land uses allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements, within the zone applied to the parcel by the Zoning Map (Figure 1).

A.    Establishment of an Allowable Use:

1. Any one or more land uses identified by Table 3 as being allowed within a particular zone may be established on any parcel within that zone, subject to the planning permit required for the use by Table 3, and in compliance with all other applicable requirements of this article.

2. Where a single parcel is proposed for development with two (2) or more land uses listed in Table 3, the overall project shall be subject to the highest planning permit level required by the table for any individual use.

B.    Permit Requirements for Allowable Uses: Table 3 identifies the uses of land allowed by this article in the zones established by section 9222 of this code, Zoning, and the planning permit required to establish each use. Table 3 provides for land uses that are:

1. Allowed subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this code and shown as “A” uses in the table;

2. Allowed subject to the approval of a minor use permit (section 9231 of this code, Administration and Procedures) and shown as “MIUP” uses in the table;

5. Not allowed within a specified zone and shown as “ – ” in the table.

C.    Use Not Listed: Whenever a use is not listed in Table 3 as an allowed use, a use requiring a use permit, or a prohibited use, the Planning Director shall determine whether the use is appropriate for the zoning district, either as an allowed use or a use subject to a use permit. In making this determination, the Planning Director shall find as follows:

1. The use is similar in nature and intensity to uses listed as allowed or requiring a use permit;

2. The use would not be incompatible with other existing allowed uses;

3. The use would not be detrimental to the continuing development of the area in which the use would be located; and

4. The use would be in harmony and consistent with the purposes of this code and the district in which the use would be located.

The determination shall be in writing and shall be final unless a written appeal to the City Council stating the reasons for the appeal, and the appeal fee, if any, established from time to time by City Council are filed with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date the decision was made. Appeals may be filed by the applicant or any interested party. The City Council shall conduct a duly noticed public hearing on the appeal in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 9231 of this code, Administration and Procedures.

§9224 STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC LAND USES


§9224.1 PURPOSE

Section 9224 of this code provides site planning, development, and/or operational standards for certain land uses that are allowed by section 9223 of this code, Building and Site Uses. The standards for each use are intended to mitigate any potentially adverse impacts associated with the specific use. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 5.010), adopted 2012)


§9224.2 APPLICABILITY

The land uses and activities included in section 9224 of this code shall comply with the provisions of the section applicable to the specific land use, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this article and the Ukiah City Code.

A.    Where Allowed: The uses that are subject to the standards in section 9224 of this code shall be located in compliance with the requirements of section 9223 of this code, Building and Site Uses.

 

B.    Land Use Permit Requirements: The uses that are subject to the standards in section 9224 of this code shall be authorized by the land use permit required by section 9223 of this code, Building and Site Uses, except where a land use requirement is established by section 9224 of this code for a specific use.

C.    Development Standards: The standards for specific land uses included in section 9224 of this code are required and supplement those included in this code and the Ukiah City Code. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of section 9224 of this code and those included in this code, the requirements of section 9224 of this code shall control. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 5.020), adopted 2012)


§9224.3 COMMUNITY GARDENS

A community garden shall comply with the requirements of this section where allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements.

A.    Days and Hours of Operation: Seven (7) days a week from seven o’clock (7:00) A.M. until dusk.

B.    Fencing: Fencing is discouraged. When fencing is required to prevent vandalism or theft, trespassing, and/or encroachment by animals, fencing shall comply with the following:

1. Open Fencing: Open fencing (such as chain link, wrought iron, deer) up to six (6) feet in height, measured from the grade adjacent to the fence to the top of the fence, is allowed at the property line or set back from the property line. This type of fencing allows the garden to be protected and maximizes the size of the garden while creating an open, pedestrian-oriented use consistent with the purposes of this code.

2. Solid Fencing: Solid fencing (such as wood, masonry) is prohibited since this closes off the site to the public realm, presents a solid unbroken surface which is not pedestrian-oriented, and reduces the size of the garden.

C.    Herbicides and Pesticides: All pest and weed control shall be accomplished through organic means using the least toxic methods available. If unsure how to combat pests, weeds, and diseases organically, contact the garden team leader or other qualified professionals or organizations for guidance and resources.

D.    Motorized Equipment: Use of motorized equipment (such as weed eaters, leaf blowers, rototillers) shall be limited to weekdays from eight o’clock (8:00) A.M. to seven o’clock (7:00) P.M. and weekends and holidays recognized by the City of Ukiah from ten o’clock (10:00) A.M. to five o’clock (5:00) P.M.

E.    Noise: Compliance with the City of Ukiah noise ordinance is required, except as indicated in subsection D of this section, Motorized Equipment, which may be more restrictive.

F.    Parking: A minimum of one parking space along the street frontage of the community garden shall be provided. Vehicle use by members of the community garden should be limited to taking supplies to and from the garden, rainy or poor weather, or a disability. Users of the garden shall be encouraged to walk or bike to the site in order to reduce the need for parking and parking impacts on neighboring uses.

G.    Signs: Signs are limited to identification, informational, and directional signs in conformance with the City of Ukiah sign ordinance requirements.

H.    Structures – Accessory: The following accessory structures are allowed: tool sheds, greenhouses, cold-frames, hoop houses, compost bins, rain barrel systems, picnic tables, benches, bike racks, garden art, and fences subject to the development standards of the zoning district in which the community garden is located and the requirements of this section. Commercially maintained portable bathrooms are allowed as accessory structures; provided, that they comply with accessibility standards and comply with the development standards of the zoning district in which the community garden is located.

I.    Water Use: Every effort shall be made to reduce water usage. Drip irrigation is required where feasible. Mulch and compost shall be used in order to reduce the amount of water needed for garden plots.

J.    Prohibitions: Smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages, using illegal drugs, and gambling are prohibited. Weapons, pets and other animals (except service animals) are also prohibited. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 5.030), adopted 2012)


§9224.4 HOME OCCUPATIONS

A home occupation shall comply with the requirements of this section where allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements.

A.    Purpose: The provisions of this section are intended to allow limited business activity to occur within a residence, where the business activity is clearly incidental to the primary residential use and will not change the residential character of the neighborhood. Home occupations are also a means of promoting workplace alternatives.

B.    Alterations to Dwelling: No interior or exterior alterations for the home occupation shall be made to the dwelling that are not customarily found in or to serve residences.

C.    Commercial Vehicles: No commercial vehicle shall be used in conjunction with a home occupation, except pickups of three-quarters ton or less.

D.    Employees: Residents plus no more than two (2) nonresidents may work at a home occupation location.

E.    Identification: The home occupation shall not be identifiable from the property line by any means, including but not limited to sight, noise, light, smoke, odor, vibration, electrical interference, dust, glare, liquid, or solid waste. A person standing on the property line of the parcel on which the home occupation is located should not be aware of the home occupation.

F.    Items for Sale: Items offered for sale shall be limited to those produced on the premises, except where the person conducting the home occupation serves as an agent or intermediary between off-site suppliers and off-site customers, in which case all articles except samples shall be received, stored, and sold to customers at off-site locations.

G.    Location: The home occupation shall be conducted primarily within the main dwelling structure and shall not involve the use of any yard space or outside area. Accessory structures such as garages may be used but not in such a way as to preclude required vehicle parking.

H.    Parking and Traffic: The home occupation shall not create pedestrian, automobile, or truck traffic or parking in excess of that normally associated with a residential use, with no more than two (2) nonresident vehicles parked on the street at any given time and no idling of employee or customer vehicles.

I.    Signs: One nonilluminated identification sign of not more than one and one-half (1.5) square feet in area may be placed flat against an outside wall of the residence to advertise the home occupation subject to application for and approval of a sign permit.

§9224.5 LARGE FAMILY DAYCARE

Large family daycare facilities shall comply with the requirements of this section where allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of these standards is to address potential impacts related to large family daycare facilities, thereby eliminating the need for a use permit. The intention is to encourage the creation of large family daycare facilities, create more options for child care, and to make the operating characteristics of these facilities compatible with surrounding uses.

B.    Permit Required: No large family daycare shall be conducted without application for and approval of a business license.

C.    Location: In no case shall a property be directly abutted by large family daycare facilities on two (2) or more sides.

D.    Parking: All dwellings used for large family daycare facilities shall provide at least three (3) parking spaces, no more than one of which may be provided in a garage or carport. These may include spaces already provided to fulfill residential parking requirements.

E.    Drop-Off and Pick-Up:

1. Drop-off and pick-up of children shall be staggered.

2. Residences located on arterial streets must provide a drop-off/pick-up area designed to prevent vehicles from backing onto the arterial roadway. For residences not located on an arterial street, on-street parking stalls adjacent to the site may be considered to satisfy this requirement.

F.    Fencing and Barriers:

1. Any side or rear yard intended for daycare use shall be surrounded by a barrier to separate children from neighboring properties unless the Planning Director determines that a barrier is not necessary (e.g., for properties not bordering developed properties). Examples of acceptable barriers include wood fences, walls, and hedges. Fences shall be installed to protect children from possible hazards (such as swimming pools, ravines, aggressive animals).

2. The location, height, and type of fencing shall comply with the fencing requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel is located.

G.    Recreation Equipment: Recreation equipment exceeding eight (8) feet in height located in any yard area intended for daycare use shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the applicable zoning district and be kept a minimum distance of five (5) feet from perimeter property lines.

H.    Noise: Noise generated from the daycare facility shall not exceed the standards established by the City of Ukiah noise ordinance as measured at the property line(s) of the daycare facility.

I.    Code Compliance and Licensing: Large family daycare facilities shall comply with all applicable building and fire codes, fire code standards adopted by the State of California, and with Social Services Department licensing requirements (California Administrative Code, Title 22, Division 2).

J.    Garage Conversions: Conversion of a garage to living space requires a building permit and compliance with parking requirements of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 5.050), adopted 2012)


§9224.6 LIVE ENTERTAINMENT

Live entertainment shall comply with the requirements of this section where allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements.

A.    Accessory Use: Live entertainment with four (4) or fewer acoustical performers is allowed as an accessory use when it is clearly incidental to the primary use of the building or site and will not negatively impact surrounding businesses and properties and hours of performance do not extend past nine o’clock (9:00) P.M.

B.    Use Permit Required: The following types of live entertainment may be authorized with approval of a use permit:

1. Bars, Cocktail Lounge: Live entertainment may be authorized at a bar or cocktail lounge with Planning Commission approval of a major use permit. The use permit shall address potential negative impacts to neighboring businesses and properties, and the possible need for police and fire services that may result from the proposed live entertainment use.

4. Extended Hours: Live entertainment may be authorized past the hours of nine o’clock (9:00) P.M. with Zoning Administrator approval of a minor use permit, except as provided for in subsection B5 of this section.

5. Planning Director Determination: When a use permit is required and the type of use permit required (minor or major) has not been prescribed by this section, the Planning Director shall determine the level of use permit required. The Planning Director may refer any application for a live entertainment use permit to the Planning Commission for public hearing.

C.    Use Permit: Use permits for live entertainment shall be processed in compliance with section 9262 of this code. In addition to the findings required by subsection 9262E of this code, an application for a live entertainment use permit shall address the following considerations:

1. Potential for loitering.

2. Adequacy of lighting for security and safety purposes.

3. Compatibility and suitability with the existing and allowed uses in the area and/or character of the area, including but not limited to proximity to sensitive land uses such as residences, schools, parks, daycare facilities, and churches.

4. Likelihood the use would facilitate the vitality, economic viability, and/or provide recreational or entertainment opportunities in an existing commercial area without presenting a significant impact on health and safety.

5. Comments from the Ukiah Police Department and Fire Department, including a projection of the increased burden to providing police services, potential for the use to add to law enforcement problems in the area and/or to contribute to or aggravate an existing crime problem in the area.

6. The potential for the need for annual review of the use permit.

7. Other information deemed necessary on a case-by-case basis. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 5.060), adopted 2012)


§9224.7 OUTDOOR DINING

On-site outdoor dining shall comply with the requirements of this section where allowed by Table 3: Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements, and only when the outdoor dining is incidental to and part of the operation of a restaurant located on the same parcel.

A.    Purpose: The provisions of this section are intended to allow outdoor dining in association with a restaurant located on the same parcel as the outdoor dining, where the outdoor dining is clearly incidental to the adjacent restaurant use and will not negatively impact the operations and function of the existing restaurant, including parking facilities, pedestrian access and circulation, and disabled access facilities.

B.    Location of Outside Dining: Outdoor dining shall be located on the same site as the restaurant which the outdoor dining will serve. Outdoor dining facilities, such as tables, chairs, umbrellas, etc., shall not be located in pedestrian walkways, required parking spaces, or disabled access facilities (such as parking spaces, walkways, entries, etc.).

4. Nonresident Employees: Up to three (3) persons who do not reside in the live/work unit may work in the unit unless this employment is prohibited or limited by a use permit. The employment of more than three (3) persons who do not reside in the live/work unit may be allowed subject to approval of a use permit, based on findings that the employment will not adversely affect traffic and parking conditions in the vicinity of the site. The employment of any persons that do not reside in the live/work unit shall comply with all applicable building code requirements.

F.    Changes in Use: After approval, a live/work unit shall not be converted to entirely residential use unless authorized through minor use permit approval. Minor use permit approval shall require that the Zoning Administrator first find that the exclusively residential use will not impair the ability of nonresidential uses adjacent to the site to continue operating because of potential health and safety concerns or nuisance complaints raised by the exclusively residential use and/or its occupants.

G.    Required Findings: The approval of a live/work unit shall require that the review authority first make all of the following findings:

1. The proposed use of each live/work unit is a bona fide commercial activity consistent with subsection B of this section (Limitations on Use).

2. The establishment of the live/work unit would not conflict with nor inhibit commercial uses in the area where the project is proposed.

3. Any changes to the exterior appearance of the building will be compatible with adjacent commercial uses where all adjacent land is zoned for commercial uses.

§9225.3 BUILDING TYPES

Table 5 illustrates the required location of each building type depicted relative to the frontage lines and lot lines of a parcel and identifies uses often associated with each building type.

 

Table 5: Building Types  

	Building Types	ZONE

	a.	Side Yard. A building that occupies one side of the lot with the setback to the other side. The visual opening of the side yard on the street frontage causes this building type to appear freestanding. A shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition. If the adjacent building is similar with a blank party wall, the yard can be quite private. This type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze. Examples of uses often associated with this building type include duplex, multifamily, live/work, and mixed-use.	
[IMAGE]
	GU

UC

	b.	Rear Yard. A building that occupies the full frontage, leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard. This is a very urban type as the continuous facade steadily defines the public thoroughfare. The rear elevations may be articulated for functional purposes. In its residential form, this type is the rowhouse. For its commercial form, the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking. Examples of uses often associated with this building type include duplex, multifamily, live/work, and mixed-use (retail-office, service-office, retail/office-residential).	
[IMAGE]
	GU

UC

DC

	c.	Courtyard. A building that occupies the boundaries of the lot while internally defining one or more private patios. The building may be open only in the center (as shown) or may be open to one side in a “C” configuration (Figure 3C). This is the most urban of types as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public thoroughfare. Examples of uses often associated with this building type include apartments, condominiums, lodging, and mixed-use.	
[IMAGE]
	GU

UC

DC

	d.	Edge Yard. A building that occupies the center of its lot with setbacks on all sides. This is the least urban building type as the front yard sets it back from the frontage, while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public thoroughfare space. The front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings. The rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a well-placed accessory building. Edge yard buildings are prohibited in the GU, DC and DC zoning districts.	i

§9225.6 PRIVATE FRONTAGE TYPES

Table 8: Private Frontage Types, illustrates the various frontage types allowed by this code. The specific frontage types allowed are determined by Table 6: Principal Building Standards, and based on the zoning of the parcel.

Table 8: Private Frontage Types  

	Private Frontage Types	
[IMAGE]


	a.	Terrace or Light Court: The facade is set back from the frontage line by an elevated terrace or a sunken light court. This type buffers residential use from urban sidewalks and removes the private yard from public encroachment. The terrace is suitable for conversion to outdoor cafes.	
[IMAGE]


	b.	Forecourt: A portion of the facade is close to the frontage line and the central portion is set back. The forecourt created is suitable for vehicular drop-offs. This type should be allocated in conjunction with other frontage types. Large trees within the forecourts may overhang the sidewalks.	
[IMAGE]


	c.	Stoop: The facade is aligned close to the frontage line with the first story elevated from the sidewalk sufficiently to secure privacy for the windows. The entrance is usually an exterior stair and landing. This type is recommended for ground-floor residential use.	
[IMAGE]


	d.	Shopfront and Awning: The facade is aligned close to the frontage line with the building entrance at sidewalk grade. This type is conventional for retail use. It has a substantial glazing on the sidewalk level and an awning that may overlap the sidewalk to the maximum extent possible to within 2 feet of the curb.	
[IMAGE]


	e.	Gallery: The facade is aligned close to the frontage line with an attached cantilevered shed or a lightweight colonnade overlapping the sidewalk. This type is conventional for retail use. The gallery shall be no less than 10 feet wide and may overlap the whole width of the sidewalk to within 2 feet of the curb.	
[IMAGE]


	f.	Arcade: The facade is a colonnade that overlaps the sidewalk, while the facade at sidewalk level remains at the frontage line. This type is conventional for retail use. The arcade shall be no less than 12 feet wide and may overlap the whole width of the sidewalk to within 2 feet of the curb.

§9229 TREE PRESERVATION AND PLANTING REQUIREMENTS


§9229.1 PURPOSE

The City of Ukiah acknowledges the importance of trees to the community’s health, safety, welfare, and tranquility. Trees are a source of beauty, provide shade and other environmental benefits, enhance property values, create community identity, and generally enhance the quality of urban life. The City is committed to planting new trees as well as protecting existing trees to the greatest extent possible.

The purpose of section 9229 of this code is to identify protected trees and landmark trees and to establish the tree planting requirements for street trees, parking lots, and riparian corridors, and tree protection requirements. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.010), adopted 2012)


§9229.2 APPLICABILITY

Section 9229 of this code shall apply to new development and redevelopment within the boundaries of this code as shown on the Zoning Map (Figure 1). (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.020), adopted 2012)


§9229.3 TREE PRESERVATION

A.    Protected Trees: Table 19: Protected Trees, identifies the trees that are protected within the boundaries of this code. Removal of a tree included in Table 19 requires approval of a major exception as prescribed in Table 29.

B.    Landmark Trees: Table 20: Landmark Trees on Private Property, designates specific trees as landmark trees. The trees included in Table 20 were selected as worthy of landmark status based on one or more of the following characteristics:

1. Outstanding specimen of a species desirable to the community;

2. One of the largest or oldest trees in the City of Ukiah;

3. Historical/commemorative interest;

4. Distinctive form and/or aesthetic appeal; and/or

5. Environmental value, including importance as habitat for wildlife.

Removal of a tree included in Table 20 requires approval of a major exception as prescribed in Table 29.

C.    Development Projects:

1. The design of every development project shall recognize the desirability of preserving the protected trees identified in Table 19: Protected Trees, and Table 20: Landmark Trees on Private Property, to the greatest extent possible. The design of the grading and site improvements shall reflect consideration of the following safeguards:

a. Provision of sufficient growing areas as required by individual species;

b. No disruption or removal of structural roots or majority loss of feeder roots;

c. Fencing of trees at or beyond the drip lines during grading and construction activities;

d. No ornamental landscape, filling, cutting, development, or compaction of soils within the drip line;

e. Posting of a sign identifying the Tree Protection Zone during all grading and construction activities; and

f. Other measures required by the particular species of tree(s) to be preserved as recommended by the consulting arborist, horticulturist, or landscape architect.

2. It is recognized that the preservation of all existing trees on a development site may sometimes conflict with reasonable land development considerations (e.g., adequate drainage, circulation, safety, and provision of utilities). However, the design of the proposed development shall address the preservation of the most desirable and significant of the healthy trees and the developer is encouraged to utilize creative land planning techniques to achieve this goal.

3. In order to ensure the long-term health of tree(s) to be preserved, trees proposed for preservation shall meet the following criteria as determined by a certified arborist:

a. Good (4) or excellent (5) health;

b. Moderate (3) to good (4) structure; and

c. The ability of the tree to withstand the long-term and short-term impacts of construction and development.

4. Grading and landscaping plans shall implement the approved tree preservation plan. The locations of all protected trees shall be indicated on the plans by the number of the tree as described in the City approved project plans and/or City approved arborist report. Plans shall be consistent with the required tree protection measures included in the project conditions of approval and/or mitigation measures included in the initial study, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report.

D.    Tree Protection Requirements: Trees required to be preserved are subject to the following protection measures in order to reduce the likelihood of construction-related impacts and to ensure the long-term health of the tree(s).

1. Prior to initiating any construction activity on a construction project, including demolition or grading, protective tree fencing shall be installed at the Tree Protection Zone for each tree to be preserved.

2. The protective tree fencing shall be shown on the approved building permit or improvement plans. This fencing shall serve as a barrier to prevent encroachment of any type by construction activities, equipment, materials storage, or personnel.

3. The Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) is illustrated on the improvement and/or building permit plans and represents the area around each tree or group of trees which must be protected at all times with tree protection fencing. No encroachment into the TPZ is allowed at any time without approval from the project arborist. Signs identifying the TPZ shall remain in place for the duration of grading and construction. The sign shall read: “Warning: Tree Protection Zone. This fencing shall not be removed without approval of the Planning Director.”

4. Contractors and subcontractors shall direct all equipment and personnel to remain outside the fenced area at all times until the project is complete, and shall instruct personnel and subcontractors as to the purpose and importance of fencing and preservation.

5. No grading shall occur within the protective barriers without approval by the Planning Director.

6. No attachments or wires other than those of a protective and nondamaging nature shall be attached to a protected tree.

7. Excavation or landscape preparation within the protective barriers shall be limited to the use of hand tools and small handheld power tools and shall not be of a depth that could cause root damage.

8. When the existing grade around a protected tree is to be raised, the project arborist shall provide written directions on which method(s) may be used to drain liquids away from the trunk.

9. When the existing grade around a protected tree is to be lowered, the project arborist shall provide written directions on which method(s) may be used (such as terracing, retaining wall) to allow the drip line to be left at the original grade.

10. No equipment, solvents, paint, asphalt, or debris of any kind shall be placed, stored, or allowed within the protective barrier.

E.    Replacement Trees:

1. Development Projects: Healthy trees as defined by subsection C3 of this section approved for removal as part of a development project shall be replaced at a ratio determined by the conditions of approval or the mitigation measures for the project. If there is inadequate space on the site to replace the trees, the trees may be planted off site at a location to be determined by the City.

2. Protected Trees: If the City authorizes the removal of a protected tree(s) because it is dead, dangerous, or a nuisance, no tree replacement is required. In all other cases, the tree(s) must be replaced.

3. Street Trees: If the City authorizes removal of a street tree in connection with a development project, the replacement requirements shall be specified in the conditions of approval for the permit for the development project.

F.    Exceptions: The removal or relocation of protected trees is exempt from the provisions of this section under the following circumstances:

1. Emergency Situations: In cases of emergency where the City of Ukiah determines there is a substantial, imminent risk or hazard to the public, adjacent properties, or to public facilities, a protected or landmark tree may be removed. In cases where there is a substantial, imminent risk or hazard to the public, adjacent properties, or to public facilities and City of Ukiah approval cannot be obtained due to City Hall closure (such as weekend, City holiday, or after hours), the tree may be removed; provided, that documentation of the emergency situation be provided to the Planning Department as soon as possible.

2. Traffic Visibility Obstructions: To maintain adequate line of sight distances as required by the Director of Public Works.

3. Public Utility Damage: To protect existing electrical power or communications lines.

4. Damage to Building Foundation: To prevent damage to the foundation of existing buildings. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.030), adopted 2012)


§9229.4 PLANTING REQUIREMENTS

A.    Required Tree Planting: Tables 21, 23, 24, and 26 identify the required tree species for planting as street trees, parking lot trees, and riparian trees, respectively. These tables also include information regarding the characteristics of each tree in the table (such as evergreen or deciduous, size, drought tolerance, native, and the suitability/compatibility with various locational constraints). Tree species should be selected based on the conditions specific to the proposed development. The tree species included in Tables 21 and 23 were selected based on hardiness, drought tolerance, native/local preference, as well as unifying design principles.

B.    Minimum Tree Size: The minimum tree size for street trees, parking lot trees, riparian trees, and replacement trees required as condition of project approval or as mitigation measures for a project shall be No. 15 unless a different size is approved by the decision making body or required in order to mitigate an environmental impact of the project.

C.    Irrigation Plan: Irrigation shall be provided to new trees. The type of irrigation provided (e.g., drip, bubbler, spray) shall be determined by the water requirements of the specific species. Every effort shall be made to place plants with similar water needs together. A conceptual irrigation plan shall be included as part of the landscaping plan submitted as part of the development permit application.

D.    Additional Requirements: Additional considerations for tree planting and landscaping are included in section 9225 of this code, Table 10: Landscaping Standards for All Developments, and section 9228 of this code, Table 18: Open Parking Lot Design Standards.

E.    Street Trees Required: Residential, commercial, and industrial developments and the development of individual lots shall include the planting of street trees at developer’s/property owner’s expense, including the following:

1. Operable irrigation system;

2. Tree wells a minimum of four feet (4') by four feet (4');

3. Root barriers when required by the Department of Public Works;

4. Trees grates when required by the Department of Public Works;

5. Structural soil when required by the Department of Public Works or Planning Department; and

6. One street tree for every thirty feet (30') of parcel frontage with the exact location to be determined by the Public Works Department and Planning Department based on the location of sewer and water lines, underground and overhead lines and the purpose requirements of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.040), adopted 2012)


§9229.5 STREET TREE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

The spacing and species selected for use as street trees and included in Table 21: Required Street Trees for Primary Streets, Table 22: Alternate Street Trees for Primary Streets, and Table 23: Required Street Trees for Nonprimary Streets, are based on the trees’ ability to grow well in Ukiah’s climate, withstand the street tree setting and the following design principles:

A.    Street trees, by virtue of a narrow tree trunk, provide transparency at the pedestrian’s eye level, permitting a visual grasp of extensive areas of a city.

B.    The type, spacing, structure, and pattern of street trees create a discrete rhythm that results from the arrangement of trees, expressing the particular site.

C.    Street trees create a smaller scale of space with their canopies that is sympathetic to the movement and perception of pedestrians.

D.    The diversity of individual trees is subordinate to the repetitive pattern of the whole, which unifies the individual parts into a single whole.

E.    Street trees, when formed from a single species, can create a homogeneity of texture, pattern, light and shade, resulting in a collective impact that is more important than the individual trees.

F.    The ground surface is visually unobstructed to permit a clear visual expression of trees rising out of the ground.

G.    Street trees provide a buffer between the pedestrian and vehicle travel/parking lanes, creating an enhanced sense of safety. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.050), adopted 2012)


§9229.6 USE OF ALTERNATE TREE SPECIES

Tables 22 and 25 provide alternative tree species for planting as street trees and parking lot trees. Use of a species from these tables requires written approval from the decision making body for the project (e.g., Planning Director, Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission) as determined by section 9231 of this code, Administration and Procedures. Trees from the Alternate Tree Table may be considered for planting when locational constraints or other project-specific issues make a tree from the Required Tree Table unsuitable for planting. The species included in Tables 21 and 24 were selected based on their ability to tolerate various site constraints, such as limited overhead or root space.

§9229.7 REQUIRED STREET TREES

Table 21: Required Street Trees for Primary Streets, identifies the tree species that are required to be planted on specific primary streets. Considerations for selection of the species to be planted include site constraints, such as root confinement, overhead wires, canopies, and other street trees in the area. The intent is to create a unifying theme consistent with the street tree design principles included in section 9229.5 of this code by limiting the number of tree species, thereby creating a distinct identity for each primary street included in Table 21. As noted in Table 21, for most streets there is one tree identified to be used at intersections and opportunities to select from several species for planting within the block.

(Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 10.080), adopted 2012)


§9229.8 ALTERNATE STREET TREES FOR PRIMARY STREETS

Table 22 identifies the tree species that may be used as a substitute for the species required by Table 21. For most streets included in Table 22 there is one tree identified to be used at intersections and opportunities to select from several species for planting within the block. Use of a tree from Table 22 requires Zoning Administrator approval of a minor exception. In order to plant a tree species that is not included in Table 21 or Table 22, Planning Commission approval of a major exception is required.

A.    Exception Review and Considerations: The request for an exception shall be reviewed by the Planning Department, Public Works Department, and the Electric Utility Department. The exception application shall include the following information in addition to the information required by Table 29: Exception Procedures.

1. Why species from the required tree list cannot be planted;

2. Why the alternative species proposed is a preferred and appropriate substitute;

3. How the alternative species is consistent with the intent to create a unifying planting theme for the primary streets within the boundaries of this code; and

§9230 CIRCULATION STANDARDS


§9230.1 PURPOSE

The purpose of section 9230 of this code is to create a circulation system that balances the needs of the pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorist by creating interconnected and pedestrian-oriented streets in an environment that accommodates a mix of commercial and residential uses, and facilitates a diverse, compact and walkable, urban environment. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.010), adopted 2012)


§9230.2 APPLICABILITY

Section 9230 of this code shall apply to the design and construction of a new or reconstructed street, alley, or pedestrian/bike path within the boundaries of this code. No grading or building permit shall be issued and no discretionary entitlement shall be approved unless the proposed construction complies with section 9230 of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.020), adopted 2012)


§9230.3 CIRCULATION MAP

The Circulation Map (Figure 8) identifies the existing circulation system, extensions of existing streets, and locations of required and recommended pedestrian/bicycle paths. No new streets are shown on the Circulation Map; however, new streets may be required as part of a subdivision, site development, or site redevelopment in order to comply with the development standards and circulation requirements of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.030), adopted 2012)


§9230.4 PRIMARY STREETS

All existing streets within the boundaries of this code are considered primary streets except the following: Oak Street from Clay Street to Henry Street and Standley Street from Main Street to Mason Street. Primary streets shall be held to the highest standards of this code in support of pedestrian activities. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.040), adopted 2012)


§9230.5 STREETS

Figure 8: Circulation Map, identifies existing streets, extensions of existing streets, and improvements to existing streets. Figures 10 through 14 are the required thoroughfare sections for this code.

A.    Downtown Streetscape Improvement Plan: The Downtown Streetscape Improvement Plan approved by the City Council on July 1, 2009, includes new street sections for all of North State Street and Main Street and for portions of Henry Street, Smith Street, Standley Street, Perkins Street, Church Street, Stephenson Street, and Clay Streets located within the boundaries of this code. Any new development or redevelopment that requires frontage or street improvements shall be consistent with the Downtown Streetscape Improvement Plan.

B.    New Streets: Any new street required as part of a subdivision, site development, or site redevelopment shall comply with one of the sections allowed within the boundaries of this code as shown in Figures 10 through 13. The appropriate street section will be determined as part of the development review process.

C.    Street Extensions: The purpose of the street extensions is to extend throughout the boundaries of this code the grid pattern of smaller walkable blocks that currently exists in the downtown, comply with block perimeter standards included in Table 4: Site Development Standards, comply with the circulation and other requirements of this code, and to implement the purpose of this code included in section 9220 of this code.

1. Required Street Extensions: This code includes the required extensions of existing streets identified below. Compliance with block perimeter and other requirements of this code will be determined through the development review process.

a. Clay Street: Clay Street extended across the railroad tracks to connect to Leslie Street. The extension of Clay Street over the railroad tracks requires approval of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). If the PUC does not approve the crossing of the railroad tracks, Clay Street would include two (2) separate segments: (1) Main Street to the railroad right-of-way which is an existing street that would be improved to include wide sidewalks, street trees, and bike lanes, and (2) an extension from the east side of the railroad right-of-way to connect with Leslie Street and align with Peach Street to create a four (4) way intersection.

b. Hospital Drive: Hospital Drive extended to the extension of Clay Street. The location and design of the extension of Hospital Drive shall take into consideration the preservation and enhancement of Gibson Creek.

2. Recommended Street Extension: This code includes the following recommended extensions of existing streets:

a. Church Street: Church Street extended from Main Street terminating at the railroad right-of-way. This street extension is recommended if the parcels across which Church Street would be extended are assembled and redeveloped. In order to comply with the minimum block perimeter standards, some form of circulation improvement may be required as part of a development proposal. Compliance with the block perimeter requirement shall be determined as part of the project review process.

b. Stephenson Street: Stephenson Street extended from Main Street terminating at the railroad right-of-way. This street extension is recommended if the parcels across which Stephenson Street would be extended are assembled and redeveloped. In order to comply with the minimum block perimeter standards, some form of circulation improvement may be required as part of a development proposal. Compliance with the block perimeter requirement shall be determined as part of the project review process.

D.    Modifications to Existing Street Sections: Projects that require frontage improvements shall construct improvements consistent with one of the thoroughfare sections required for this code. The appropriate section shall be determined as part of the development review process. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.050), adopted 2012)


§9230.6 ALLEYS

New development and redevelopment are encouraged to provide access to their projects via rear alleys. In some circumstances, alley access may be required in order to comply with the applicable development standards, such as block perimeter, parking location, and frontage type, of the zoning district in which the project is located. The appropriate location for alleys will depend on the type and location of the development proposed and will be evaluated as part of the development review process. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.060), adopted 2012)


§9230.7 PEDESTRIAN/BIKE PATHS

The location shown in Figure 8 is approximate and every effort should be made to provide this access as part of a development application in the general area shown on the Circulation Map. The required path shall be constructed to the standards of a Caltrans Class I path.

B.    Recommended Paths:

1. Block Perimeter: Caltrans Class I paths in lieu of construction of a thoroughfare may be proposed for areas that do not meet the block perimeter standards of this code. Consideration of a bike/pedestrian path in lieu of construction of a thoroughfare requires Planning Commission approval of a major exception.

2. Bike/Pedestrian Connections: Bike/pedestrian paths are recommended for areas that lack designated pedestrian/bike connections in order to provide the required circulation pattern, pedestrian orientation, and walkability.

C.    Type of Path: All paths shall be constructed as Caltrans Class I paths where feasible. Modification to this standard requires approval of a major exception. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.070), adopted 2012)


§9230.8 GIBSON CREEK

Gibson Creek is located within the boundaries of this code and provides riparian and aquatic habitat that supports a variety of insects, amphibians, fish, and animals and serves as a water source and migration corridor for wildlife. New road or bridge construction should be designed to balance vehicular, bike, and pedestrian circulation with the community’s desire to enhance and preserve the creek and its riparian and aquatic habitat, and associated wildlife. New development adjacent to the creek shall dedicate right-of-way or provide an access easement of sufficient width to allow for adequate maintenance of the creek. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 11.080), adopted 2012)


§9230.9 EXCEPTION TO CIRCULATION DESIGN STANDARDS

Modifications to the circulation design standards required in section 9230 of this code may be allowed with Planning Commission approval of a major exception as part of its review of a specific subdivision or development proposal.

§9231.3 SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMITS

Table 27 establishes the procedures for review and processing of site development permits. Table 27 establishes three (3) levels of site development permits based on the size of the project.

A.    Purpose: Site development permit procedures are intended to focus on design issues and solutions that will have the greatest effect on community character and to encourage innovative design solutions and quality design. The purposes of this section are to:

1. Recognize the interdependence of land values and aesthetics and encourage the orderly and harmonious appearance of development within the community.

2. Ensure that new uses and structures enhance their sites with high standards of improvement and are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.

3. Protect the increasing values, standards, and importance of land and development in the community.

4. Retain and strengthen the visual quality of the community.

5. Assist project developers in understanding the public’s concerns for the aesthetics of development.

6. Ensure that development complies with all applicable City standards and guidelines, and does not adversely affect community health, safety, aesthetics, or natural resources.

B.    Design Criteria: Design criteria have been established to provide guidance in the design and development of projects. The following criteria shall be considered in reviewing a site development permit application and establishing conditions for the project.

1. Site layout, buffers, and setback distances and physical relationship of structures and uses on the site and to surrounding topography, natural resources, uses, and structures.

2. Protection, preservation, and integration of historic, cultural and scenic resources and orientation to natural site amenities and scenic views.

3. Incorporation of low impact development (LID) design principles into the design of new development, redevelopment, and the expansion or modification of existing development, including parking, access and circulation areas where feasible.

4. Site access, including pedestrian, bicycle, parking for vehicles and bicycles, and loading areas, and on-site and off-site traffic and pedestrian circulation.

5. Integration of the site into the pedestrian and traffic circulation system, including off-site improvements and opportunities for connections to adjoining streets, parks, open space, community facilities and commercial areas.

6. Height, bulk, and area of buildings and the overall mass and scale of the project in relation to the site characteristics, neighborhood, and surrounding land uses.

7. Landscape elements that integrate opportunities for outdoor use areas and adequate shading of pavement and windows.

8. Articulation in building facades, exterior architectural design details, quality of materials, variation of textures, and harmony of colors.

9. Articulation in rooflines and the type and pitch of roofs and/or mechanical screening and overhangs for proper shading and solar access to windows.

10. Location, size, and spacing of windows, doors, and other openings and orientation for passive solar heating and cooling and provision of awnings, enclosures, and overhangs for entryways.

11. Location and orientation of windows, doorways, and outdoor use areas and the potential for heat, glare, odors, noise, or other disturbances from on-site or off-site sources (i.e., direct sun from west exposures, outdoor lighting, food services areas, recycling and refuse areas, mechanical equipment, roadways, railroads, aircraft overflight, etc.).

12. Location of towers, chimneys, roof structures, flagpoles, radio, telecommunications and television masts/poles or other projections.

13. Use of durable, quality materials and provisions for long-term maintenance including identification of responsible party and funding source for public improvements and open space areas.

14. Location, design, access, and visual screening for recycling and refuse disposal areas and utility installations.

15. Location, design, and standards of all exterior illumination, including parking lot and sign lighting.

16. Signage including the size, type, location, material quality, durability, textures, height, color, light intensity, and integration into the building and street design, and the potential for distraction of traffic and/or obstruction of other signs, access ways, and sight visibility areas.

C.    Findings: The review authority may approve a site development permit application only after first finding that:

1. The proposed project is consistent with the City of Ukiah General Plan, Ukiah City Code, and this code.

2. Design: The design of the proposed project is consistent with the architectural standards of this code and compatible with the character of the neighborhood; will maintain the community’s character, provide for harmonious and orderly development, and create a desirable environment for the occupants, neighbors, and visiting public; includes the appropriate use of materials, texture, and color, which will remain aesthetically appealing and appropriately maintained; and the location and orientation of windows, doorways, and outdoor use areas reduce the potential for heat, glare, noise, or other disturbance from on-site or off-site sources. The neighborhood compatibility part of this finding does not apply if it would render the project inconsistent with the architectural requirements of the zoning district in which the project is located.

3. Siting: The siting of the structure(s) on the parcel is compatible with the siting of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. This finding does not apply if the resulting setbacks are inconsistent with the requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel is located.

4. Ingress, Egress, Circulation, Parking: The project provides adequate ingress, egress, parking for vehicles and bicycles, and internal circulation for vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, and delivery vehicles designed to promote safety and convenience and to conform to City standards and will not create potential traffic, pedestrian, or bicycle hazards or a distraction for motorists. Low impact development (LID) design has been incorporated into the project where feasible.

5. Landscaping: The landscaping for the project provides opportunities for shading west and south facing windows and outdoor use areas, utilizes native and drought tolerant species, is in keeping with the character and design of the project, and consistent with requirements of this code and City standards.

6. Resource Protection: The proposed project will not excessively damage or destroy resources or natural features, including cultural and historic resources, trees, shrubs, creeks, and the natural grade of the site.

7. Health, Safety, Welfare: The proposed project would not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; is not materially injurious to the properties or improvements in the immediate vicinity; and will not tend to cause the surrounding area to depreciate materially in appearance or value or otherwise discourage occupancy, investment, or orderly development in the area.

B.    Intent: It is the intent of this section to discourage the long-term continuance of nonconformities, providing for their eventual elimination, while allowing them to exist under the limited conditions of this section.

C.    Detrimental to Orderly Development: The continuance of a nonconforming use or structure is generally detrimental to the orderly development of the area within the boundaries of this code and the general welfare of its residents and is particularly detrimental to the welfare of persons and property in the vicinity of the nonconformity.

D.    Illegal Use or Structure: Any use or structure which was established or constructed in violation of the applicable zoning regulations in effect at the time of establishment or construction and which is not in conformity with the applicable regulations of this zoning code is not a nonconforming use or structure, and the use or structure is in violation of this code. (Ord. 1139, §2 (Exh. A, 12.120), adopted 2012)


§9231.13 NONCONFORMING USES

A.    Continued, Transferred, or Sold: Nonconforming uses may be continued, transferred, or sold, but only in compliance with the provisions of this section.

B.    Replacing Nonconforming Uses with Similar Uses:

1. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar or more restricted classification or nature; provided, the proposed new nonconforming use would not increase the degree or intensity of nonconformity.

2. The replacement nonconforming use shall serve as the “new bench mark” in terms of establishing the acceptable level of nonconformity.

3. Where a nonconforming use is changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of a less restrictive classification.

C.    Enlargement or Expansion of Use Not Allowed:

1. Nonconforming Use of Land without Structures:

a. A nonconforming use of land which does not involve any structure except accessory structures shall not be enlarged or expanded in size or capacity or extended to occupy a greater area, or increased in intensity without Planning Commission approval of a major use permit.

b. A nonconforming use of land which does not involve any structure except accessory structures shall not be relocated, extended, or expanded into a structure constructed on the parcel without Planning Commission approval of a major use permit.

c. “Accessory structures” as used in this subsection include driveways, fences, parking areas, signs, walls, or minor structures less than four hundred (400) square feet in area.

2. Nonconforming Use of Land with Structures: Changes to a nonconforming use of a structure by enlargement, extension, reconstruction, or relocation within the structure, or an addition to the structure, or the construction of a new structure shall not be allowed without Planning Commission approval of a major use permit.

3. Findings: In approving a major use permit, the Planning Commission shall make the following findings in addition to the findings required by subsection 9262E of this code:

a. The enlargement, expansion, extension, or increase would not increase the detrimental effects of the nonconformity; and

b. The structure complies with the development standards of the zoning district in which the structure is located.

C.    Enforcement:

1. Public Nuisance: The violation of this section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

2. Abatement: A violation of this section may be abated by the City Attorney by the prosecution of a civil action for injunctive relief and by the summary abatement procedure set forth in subsection C3 of this section.

3. Summary Abatement Procedure:

a. The Code Enforcement Officer and the Director of Planning, or his or her designee (hereafter, the "enforcement official"), are hereby authorized to order the abatement of any violation of this section by issuing a notice to abate. The notice shall:

(1) Describe the location of and the specific conditions which represent a violation of this section and the actions required to abate the violation.

(2) Describe the evidence relied upon to determine that a violation exists; provided, that the enforcement official may withhold the identity of a witness to protect the witness from injury or harassment, if such action is reasonable under the circumstances.

(3) State the date and time by which the required abatement actions must be completed.

(4) State that to avoid the civil penalty provided in subsection C3a(8) of this section and further enforcement action, the enforcement official must receive consent to inspect the premises where the violation exists to verify that the violation has been abated by the established deadline.

(5) State that the owner or occupant of the property where the violation is located has a right to appeal the notice by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk by no later than three (3) business days from the service of the notice. The notice of appeal must include an address, telephone number, fax number, if available, and email address, if available. The City may rely on any of these for service or notice purposes. If an adequate written appeal is timely filed, the owner or occupant will be entitled to a hearing as provided in subsection C3c of this section.

(6) State that the order to abate the violation becomes final if a timely appeal is not filed or upon the issuance of a written decision after the appeal hearing is conducted in accordance with subsection C3c of this section.

(7) State that a final order of abatement may be enforced by application to the Superior Court for an inspection and/or abatement warrant or other court order.

(8) State that a final order to abate the nuisance will subject the property owner and the occupant to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day that the violation continues after the date specified in the notice under subsection C3a(3) of this section, when the violation must be abated. The penalty may be recovered through an ordinary civil action, or in connection with an application for an inspection or nuisance abatement warrant.

(9) State that in any administrative or court proceeding to enforce the abatement order the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees from the other party or parties to the action, if the City elects, at the initiation of an individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorney fees. In no action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorney fees incurred by the City in the action or proceeding.

b. The notice described in subsection C3a of this section shall be served in the same manner as summons in a civil action in accordance with article 3 (commencing with section 415.10) of chapter 4 of title 5 of part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the option of the City. If the owner of record, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation pursuant to Government Code section 6062.

c. Not sooner than five (5) business days after a notice of appeal is filed with the City Clerk, a hearing shall be held before the City Manager or a hearing officer designated by the City Manager to hear such appeals. The appellant shall be given notice of the date, time and place of the hearing not less than five (5) days in advance. The notice may be given by telephone, fax, email, personal service or posting on the property. At the hearing, the enforcement official shall present evidence of the violation, which may include, but is not limited to, incident and police reports, witness statements, photographs, and the testimony of witnesses. The property owner and the occupant of the property where the violation is alleged to exist shall have the right to present evidence and argument in their behalf and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The property owner and property occupant are entitled at their own expense to representation of their choice. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Manager or hearing officer shall render a written decision which may be served by regular first class mail on the appellants.

d. A final order to abate the nuisance will subject the property owner or owners and any occupant or occupants of the property who are cultivating marijuana in violation of this section to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day that the violation continues after the date specified in the notice under subsection C3a(3) of this section, when the violation must be abated. The enforcement official or the City Manager or hearing officer hearing an appeal pursuant to subsection C3c of this section may reduce the daily rate of the civil penalty for good cause. The party subject to the civil penalty shall have the burden of establishing good cause, which may include, but is not limited to, a consideration of the nature and severity of the violation, whether it is a repeat offense, the public nuisance impacts caused by the violation, and the violator’s ability to pay. The daily penalty shall continue until the violation is abated. The penalty may be recovered through an ordinary civil action, or in connection with an application for an inspection or nuisance abatement warrant.

4. Violation: Cultivation of marijuana on parcels within the City that does not comply with this section constitutes a violation of the zoning ordinance and is subject to the penalties and enforcement as provided in Chapter 2, Article 22 of this division.

5. Penalties Not Exclusive: The remedies and penalties provided herein are cumulative, alternative and nonexclusive. The use of one does not prevent the use of any others and none of these penalties and remedies prevent the City from using any other remedy at law or in equity which may be available to enforce this section or to abate a public nuisance.

§9260 PURPOSE

The purpose of this Article is to establish the development permit and rezoning/prezoning processing procedures, and to establish the process and legal procedures associated with the enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter. Additionally, this Article establishes the office of the Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 1002, §2, adopted 1998)


§9261 DISCRETIONARY PLANNING PERMITS

The City’s discretionary planning permits include use permits, site development permits, and variances.

A.    Use Permits: A use permit is an entitlement that permits a certain use of land in a zoning district where the use is not allowed by right. Each zoning district contains both allowed and permitted land uses. "Allowed" land uses are allowed without a use permit, while "permitted" uses can only be established with the securing of a use permit. Use permits are usually issued with "conditions", and are intended to provide flexibility by permitting land uses that will not have an adverse impact on surrounding land uses or the general public. The detailed provisions for use permits are contained in Section 9262 of this Article.

B.    Site Development Permits: Site development permits are required for the construction of new multiple-family residential, commercial, and industrial structures, or the substantial exterior modification of existing multiple-family residential, commercial, and industrial structures. Projects exempt from the site development permit process include interior building remodels, repair and maintenance of structures or parking areas, minor alterations on building exteriors, and minor accessory structures to established, multiple-family residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Upon request, the Planning Director shall determine whether a project is exempt under this subsection in accordance with the following standards:

1. The project involves an addition of less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet to an existing structure, and the addition would not be highly visible from any public street; or

2. The project involves minor facade modifications that would not significantly change the architectural character or appearance of the structure.

The detailed provisions for site development permits are contained in Section 9263 of this Article.

C.    Variance Permits: A variance is a permit to deviate from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance. It provides relief from specific site development regulations. It is provided for because there are individual lots which, due to some unusual characteristic, cannot be put to productive use if all detailed regulations (e.g., yard setbacks, height) are strictly applied. Variances are not issued for land uses ("use variance") or relief of lot size requirements. The detailed provisions for variances are contained in Section 9264 of this Article.

D.    Major And Minor Use Permits, Site Development Permits, And Variances: At the time of application submittal, the Planning Director or assigned designee shall determine if the proposed project constitutes a major or minor use permit, site development permit, or variance. The Planning Director or assigned designee shall be guided by the following criteria when determining whether a discretionary planning permit is major or minor:

1. In the C-1, C-2, and M Zoning Districts, facade improvements, small additions/expansions of more than one hundred fifty (150) square feet, but less than one thousand (1,000) square feet to existing structures, minor amendments to previously approved permits, and changes in use of existing structure(s) that do not require additional parking, and will not generate substantial amounts of additional traffic, noise, or other potential nuisances shall be considered minor in nature. Additions of one thousand (1,000) square feet or more shall be considered major discretionary projects. In the R-2, R-3, and C-N Zoning Districts, additions of six hundred forty (640) or more square feet shall be considered major discretionary projects.

In the C-N (Neighborhood Commercial) Zoning District, a use permit is required to exceed the maximum thirty percent (30%) floor area ratio standard. A proposal to exceed this standard by less than ten percent (10%) is considered a minor use permit.

2. New construction on vacant parcels, large additions/expansions to existing buildings, substantial amendments to previously approved permits, and changes in use of existing structure(s) that would require an expansion of an existing parking facility, or that could generate substantial amounts of additional traffic, noise, or other nuisances shall be considered a major permit.

3. Minor variance applications are those seeking less than fifty percent (50%) relief from a yard setback requirement in a particular zoning district, or a height of less than five feet (5’) over what is allowed in a particular zoning district.

4. Other small and relatively insignificant applications as determined by the Planning Director shall be considered minor.

5. a. In all zoning districts in which they are a permitted use, the following cannabis-related businesses shall be considered major uses:

Cannabis cultivation – Large indoor.

Cannabis cultivation – Large mixed light.

Cannabis cultivation – Medium indoor.

Cannabis cultivation – Medium mixed light.

Cannabis cultivation – Small indoor.

Cannabis cultivation – Small mixed light.

Cannabis cultivation – Specialty cottage.

Cannabis cultivation – Specialty indoor.

Cannabis cultivation – Specialty mixed light.

Cannabis microbusiness.

Cannabis nursery.

Major use permits issued for cannabis-related businesses shall be subject to annual review, and shall be subject to annual review and revocation according to the procedures set forth in subsections 9262K and L of this code.

b. In all zoning districts in which they are a permitted use, the following cannabis-related businesses shall be considered minor uses:

Cannabis distribution.

Cannabis manufacturing – Level 1.

Minor use permits issued for cannabis-related businesses shall be subject to annual review, and shall be subject to annual review and revocation according to the procedures set forth in subsections 9262K and L of this code. 

c. In the Heavy Commercial (C-2) and Manufacturing (M) Zoning Districts, cannabis testing laboratories shall be considered a minor use. In the Community Commercial Zoning District (C-1) and General Urban (GU), Urban Center (UC), and Downtown Core (DC) Zoning Districts, cannabis testing laboratories shall be considered a major use.

d. In all zoning districts in which they are a permitted use, cannabis retailers will be required to obtain a dispensary use permit, as set forth in Division 6, Chapter 8 of this code.

E.    Use Or Project Not Established: Whenever in this Article a permit is subject to revocation because the use or project for which the permit was issued is not established within required time limits, "not established" shall mean that the permittee has not taken substantial steps and has not incurred substantial expense to construct, complete and commence the use for which the permit was issued, and is not diligently completing the project and commencing the use for which the permit was issued. (Ord. 1002, §2, adopted 1998; Ord. 1186, §7, adopted 2018; Ord. 1188, §4, adopted 2018)


§9262 USE PERMIT PROCEDURES

Use permit application and processing procedures shall be as follows:

A.    General: Use permits shall be issued as provided in this Chapter only for land uses or purposes for which such permits are required. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing and decide all applications for use permits required by this Chapter. If the Planning Director determines that the use permit application is minor in nature, it shall be scheduled for a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator. If the Planning Director determines that the use permit application is major, it shall be scheduled for consideration by the Planning Commission for public hearing and action.

Projects requiring a use permit for new construction or exterior modifications need not have a separate site development permit. Site development review, criteria, and findings shall be incorporated into the use permit process.

B.    Application Filing And Submittal Requirements: Applications for use permits shall be filed with the City Planning Department and shall be accompanied by a plot plan sufficient to show the details of the proposed use or building, as well as surrounding land uses, and any other project related information deemed necessary by the Planning Director. Application fees shall be established from time to time by resolution of the City Council adopted in accordance with the procedures required by law. The payment of the established fee shall be made at the time of application submittal.

C.    Public Noticing Requirements: The City shall follow the public noticing procedures of the California Government Code. Failure of any person to receive mailed notice or failure to post notice shall not invalidate any proceedings conducted by the decision-making body. Unless in conflict with the notice requirements of the Government Code, notices of public hearings on applications for use permits shall be given at least ten (10) days prior thereto, by the following manner:

1. Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.

2. Notice by mail, using addresses from the latest equalized assessment roll, to all owners of property within a three hundred foot (300’) distance of any boundary of the subject property, and to the project applicant or agent, as well as to the property owner of record.

3. Notice shall be mailed or delivered at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing to each local agency expected to provide essential facilities and services which may be significantly affected.

4. The subject property shall be posted in three (3) locations ten (10) days prior to the public hearing.

D.    Action On Use Permits: All applications for use permits shall be considered and acted upon by either the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission.

1. The Zoning Administrator shall review, conduct public hearings, and decide upon all minor use permit applications.

2. Appeals of the Zoning Administrator actions shall be heard by the City Council for a final decision.

3. The Planning Commission shall review, conduct public hearings, and decide upon all major use permit applications.

4. Appeals of the Planning Commission actions shall be heard by the City Council for a final decision.

5. At the discretion of the Planning Director, any use permit application may be scheduled for consideration and decision-making by the Planning Commission.

6. Any use permit application which is reviewed by the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission may be approved, conditionally approved, or denied.

E.    Findings: Findings are required to grant a use permit.

1. The Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission, on the basis of the evidence submitted at the hearing, may grant use permits required by the provisions of this Article whenever findings of fact support the following determinations:

a. The proposed land use is consistent with the provisions of this Title as well as the goals and policies of the City General Plan.

b. The proposed land use is compatible with surrounding land uses and shall not be detrimental to the public’s health, safety and general welfare.

2. The findings shall not be vague and conclusionary. The findings shall be sufficiently detailed to apprise a reviewing court of the basis for the action by bridging the gap between the evidence and the decision-maker’s conclusions, and shall be based upon evidence contained in the administrative record.

F.    Conditions Of Approval: Conditions of project approval may be imposed on use permit applications.

1. In approving a use permit, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may include such conditions as are deemed reasonable and necessary to preserve the integrity and character of the zoning district and the General Plan. Such conditions shall promote the safe and orderly use of the property, and assure compatibility with surrounding land uses. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to limit the discretion or the authority of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission to require conditions, provided the conditions constitute a lawful exercise of the police power and not a taking of private property under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

2. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may condition a use permit to prohibit the occupancy of a building, structure, or land use until an inspection has been made which finds that the building, structure, or land use complies with all conditions specifically required to be completed prior to occupancy. If a use permit is so conditioned, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall notify the City Building Official of such conditions. If a building permit is issued for a building or structure which is subject to a use permit so conditioned, the Building Official shall not approve a final inspection of such building or structure until the conditions have been met; provided, however, that responsibility for assuring applicant compliance with the provisions of the use permit remains with the Planning Director. The Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator may also require conditions be completed prior to the issuance of building permits.

G.    Effective Date: The use permit shall be deemed legally in effect when the appeal period has lapsed, unless a timely appeal is properly filed. If an appeal is filed, the use permit shall become effective upon final approval by the City Council. This date shall be so noted in the official use permit application file and shall also be noted upon the issued use permit and/or approval confirmation letter.

H.    Expiration And Revocation: The following provisions detail the use permit expiration and revocation process:

1. Revocation: An approved use permit may be revoked through the City’s revocation process if the use for which the use permit was granted is not being conducted in compliance with the use permit as conditioned, or:

a. If any land use for which a use permit has been granted and issued is not established within two (2) years of the use permit’s effective date; or

b. If the established land use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has been suspended for twenty four (24) consecutive months.

3. New Application: Nothing herein shall prohibit the holder of a permit revoked pursuant to subsection H1a or H1b of this Section, from applying for a new permit in accordance with the procedures for new applications.

I.    Renewal: Use permits may be renewed for an additional period not to exceed one year provided, if an application for renewal is filed with the Planning Department prior to the expiration of the permit. The application shall consist of a detailed letter explaining the reason(s) for the request. The Planning Director shall grant or deny an application to renew a use permit, and shall provide an explanation of his decision, in writing, to the applicant. The Planning Director’s decision to approve a renewal shall generally be based upon a determination that all the circumstances associated with the original approval are substantially the same at the time of the renewal application. An appeal of the Planning Director’s decision may be made to the City Council for a final decision. Any such appeal must comply with the requirements of Section 9266 of this Article. (Ord. 1002, §2, adopted 1998; Ord 1186, §7, adopted 2018; Ord. 1190, §4, adopted 2018)

§9542 PURPOSE

In various locations throughout the city public facilities such as streets, bridges, traffic signals, storm drains and sewer lines must be constructed or improved in order to accommodate the impacts from or provide access to new development in those areas. The city council has determined that capital improvement fees must be established in order for that new development to contribute its fair share toward financing the construction of these improvements. (Ord. 882, §2, adopted 1988)


§9543 ESTABLISHMENT OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FEES

A.    Creation By Resolution: By resolution the city council shall establish such capital improvement fees as it determines are necessary to contribute toward the financing of public facilities. Each such resolution shall:

1. Establish and describe the benefit and impact area within which the fee shall apply;

2. Set forth the specific amount of the fee;

3. List the specific public improvement or improvements to be financed;

4. Describe the estimated cost of these facilities, and associated costs such as necessary engineering services and administrative costs;

5. Describe the reasonable relationship between the fee and the types of new development to which it will apply;

6. Set forth the time when the fee must be paid as follows:

a. As to residential development that time shall not be sooner than the date of final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs first. The city shall not furnish utilities to occupants of any such residential development prior to final inspection and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The city shall disconnect utilities furnished to a residential development if that development is occupied prior to final inspection and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. In accordance with sections 2136 to 2137 of this code, the city shall revoke the business license issued pursuant to division 2 of this code to any "person" (as defined in section 2100 of this code) engaged in a "business" (as defined in section 2101 of this code), if such person participates as seller, broker or otherwise in the sale of a residential development to an occupant of that development before final inspection and issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The city shall not issue a new business license to a person whose license is revoked as provided herein for a period of two (2) years.

b. As to all other development that time shall be at the time a building permit is issued.

c. No certificate of occupancy or building permit, as appropriate, shall issue until the required fees are paid. "Building permit", "final inspections", and "certificate of occupancy", as used in this section, have the same meaning as described in the California building code, as adopted by the city of Ukiah.

B.    Procedure: The city council shall adopt each resolution according to the following procedure:

1. The resolution shall be adopted at a public hearing at which any person may appear in person or in writing.

2. A fee study establishing the reasonable relationship between the fee and each parcel of property to which it will apply shall be available for public inspection for at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.

3. Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The notice shall describe the public facilities to be financed with the fee, the area within which the fee will apply, the amount of the fee, and the times and location where the fee study is available for public inspection.
