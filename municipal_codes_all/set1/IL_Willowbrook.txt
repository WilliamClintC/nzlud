1-4-3: APPLICATION:
The penalty provided in this chapter shall be applicable to every section of this Code the same as though it were a part of each
and every separate section. Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this Code where any duty is prescribed or
obligation imposed, or where any act which is of a continuing nature or declared to be unlawful, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day such duty or obligation remains unperformed or
such act continues, unless otherwise specifically provided in this Code.
In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by different clauses or sections of this Code, the
Prosecuting Officer may elect under which to proceed but not more than one recovery shall be had against the same person for
the same offense; provided that the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar
any other penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this Code and
there shall be no fine or penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of this chapter shall apply and a separate
offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a breach or violation occurs or continues. (1973 Code)
1-4-4: LIABILITY OF OFFICERS:
No provision of this Code designating the duties of any officer or employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or
employee liable for any fine or penalty provided for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of the Board of Trustees to
impose such fine or penalty on such officer or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty.
(1973 Code)
Chapter 5
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
1-5-1: VILLAGE TRUSTEES:
There shall be six (6) persons elected from the Village at large to the public Office of Village Trustee. Those persons so elected
to the said Office of Village Trustee shall each hold his or her office for a term of four (4) years and until his or her successor is
elected and qualified. A person qualified to be elected to the Office of Village Trustee must: a) be a qualified elector of the
Village, b) be a resident in the Village at least one year next preceding his or her election, c) not have been convicted of any
infamous crime, bribery, perjury or other felony in any court in the United States, and d) not be in debt to the Village.
The legislative and Governing Body of the Village is the Board of Trustees, consisting of the Village Mayor and the six (6) Village
Trustees, who shall each possess the qualifications for office, be elected by the legal voters of the Village, take the oath of office
and perform the duties provided by the Illinois Municipal Code.
The Board of Trustees is the default repository of all Municipal powers which have not been specifically delegated by statute to
some other board or office of the Village such as the Board of Police Commissioners, Board of Trustees of the Police Pension
Fund, the Village Mayor, the Village Clerk and the Local Liquor Control Commissioner.
The primary power of the Board of Trustees subsists in its legislative acts exercised by way of its adoption of ordinances,
resolutions or motions. Because the Board of Trustees is a group authorized by law to act as a single entity, its legislative actions
are valid only when adopted by its members during properly noticed regular and special meetings of the Board conducted in
compliance with the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
In addition to its exercise of legislative power, the Board of Trustees possesses the following powers: to determine its own rules
of procedure; to punish its members for disorderly conduct; to expel members for disorderly conduct; to compel the attendance
of absentee members at properly called meetings; to be the sole judge of the election of its members; to give advice and consent
to Mayoral appointments; to override Mayoral vetoes; and to assign needed tasks to elected or appointed executive officers.
Each individual member of the Board, when not participating in a legal Board meeting has no more power or prerogative than
any other citizen of the Village; provided: a) that an individual member of the Board has the power to inspect such records of the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 15/568
Village as are needed to carry out the member's duties, and b) that an individual member of the Board, when acting as an
authorized conservator of the peace, has the power: 1) to arrest or cause to be arrested, with or without process, all persons
who break the peace or are found violating any Village ordinance or any Criminal Law of the State, 2) to commit arrested
persons for examination, 3) if necessary, to detain arrested persons in custody overnight or Sunday, in any safe place or until
they can be brought before the proper courts, and 4) to exercise all other powers as conservators of the peace prescribed by the
Corporate Authorities. (Ord. 12-O-08, 4-9-2012)
1-5-2: MEETINGS OF BOARD:
(A) Regular Meetings: The regular meetings of the Board of Trustees shall be held on the second and fourth Mondays of each
month of the year at six thirty o'clock (6:30) P.M. in the Village. (Ord. 11-O-05, 5-23-2011)
(B) Special Meetings: Special meetings of the Board of Trustees may be called by the President, or by any three (3) Trustees, by
the giving of written notice thereof to each member of the Board of Trustees, the President and the Village Clerk (other than
to the person or persons calling said meeting). Said notice shall be signed by the person or persons calling the special
meeting and shall state the time and place of said meeting and the purposes for which it is called. Said notice may be given
to each of said persons in any of the following ways:
1. By delivering said notice to any said person personally, or by leaving same at the residence of said person in the Village
before five o'clock (5:00) P.M. of the day preceding the day upon which the meeting is to be held; or
2. By depositing said notice in the United States mail, enclosed in an envelope, plainly addressed to said person at his place
of residence in the Village, with postage fully prepaid, at least forty eight (48) hours before the time of meeting exclusive of
an intervening Sunday or legal holiday.
Said notice may be prepared and served by any one of the persons calling said meeting, or by the Village Clerk upon the
instructions of the person or persons calling said meeting. The person serving said notice shall cause an affidavit showing
service of such notice as herein provided to be filed with the Village Clerk. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, special
meetings may be held without such notice when all of the Trustees and the President are present in person, or consent in
writing to the holding of such meeting, prior to the beginning of said meeting. Any special meeting attended by all of the
Trustees and the President shall be a regular meeting for the transaction of any business which may come before such
meeting, and in such case, no notice of such meeting shall be necessary and all notice requirements shall be deemed
waived. Special meetings may be held anywhere in the Village. (Ord. 60-O-2, 2-19-1960)
(C) Fee For Special Meetings: Whenever a person, corporation or other entity, other than the President or Trustees of the
Village, desires that the President and Board of Trustees hold a special or additional Board meeting other than its regularly
scheduled Board meeting, the entity so requesting shall pay into the Municipal funds the sum of one thousand five hundred
dollars ($1,500.00) as a condition precedent to the scheduling and holding of said special meeting. Notwithstanding any
provision contained herein to the contrary, the one thousand five hundred dollar ($1,500.00) fee shall not be required where
the Village Administrator determines to conduct a specially called meeting as a matter of convenience and where such
person, corporation or other entity has paid a fee in conjunction with an application for zoning relief which requires a public
hearing before the President and Board of Trustees. (Ord. 05-O-32, 11-14-2005)
1-5-3: MEETINGS; PUBLIC COMMENT:
(A) Meetings: All meetings of the Village shall be conducted in conformance with the requirements of the "Illinois Open Meetings
Act", 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 120/1 et seq.
(B) Attendance By Means Other Than Physical Presence: In accordance with section 7 of "the Open Meetings Act", 5 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 120/7, a member of the Village's Corporate Authorities may attend a meeting of that public body by means
of a telephone conference if a majority of the body's quorum allows attendance by such other means for the reason that the
member is prevented from physically attending because of: 1) personal illness or disability; 2) employment purposes of the
business of the Village; or 3) a family or other emergency.
(C) Notice: If a member of the Village's Corporate Authorities wishes to attend a meeting of that public body by means of a
telephone conference, the member must so notify the Village's Clerk or Deputy Clerk before the day of the meeting of the
specific reason why the member is physically prevented from attending unless such advance notice is impractical.
(D) Public Comment: Pursuant to the Village's rulemaking authority set forth in the Illinois Open Meetings Act, the rules
governing public comment at all open meetings of this Village shall be as follows:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 16/568
1. There shall be a public comment period listed as a "visitors' business" item near the beginning of the meeting agenda for
all open meetings of the Village; and, that such visitors' business shall consist of all matters that touch upon and relate to
the affairs and activities of Village government.
2. All persons wishing to address Village officials and comment upon such Village business during said meetings' public
comment period shall fill out a speaker's sign in sheet and tender the same to the Deputy Clerk.
3. Only those persons who have filled out such a speaker's sign in sheet will thereafter be called to the podium by the
meeting's presiding officer during said public comment period to address Village officials and comment upon Village
business. (Ord. 13-O-06, 3-11-2013)
4. All those speakers called to the podium shall, at the outset, identify themselves by name before they offer any comments
whatsoever at the meeting. Speakers may also give their residential address by street, town, village or city, if they so
choose. (Ord. 14-O-42, 9-22-2014)
5. Speakers shall limit their commentary to three (3) minutes. Should any speaker wish to offer further comment at the
meeting beyond the time allotted, he or she may tender such further comment in written form to the Deputy Clerk; and, no
speaker shall be permitted to address the meeting more than once during the said public comment period.
6. Speakers shall relate their commentary to matters of Village business.
7. Speakers shall at all times address the meeting's presiding officer, not the audience.
8. Speakers shall offer their commentary only from the podium.
9. Speakers shall confine their remarks to commentary.
10. Speakers shall not use their commentary time in an attempt to interrogate any Village official nor in an attempt to force
any official to engage in debate on any issue or matter.
11. Speakers shall return to their seat or leave the meeting room at the end of their remarks.
12. Speakers shall refrain from unduly repetitious remarks during their allotted commentary time.
13. Speakers shall not employ profane, defamatory or threatening language nor shall they engage in any personal attacks.
14. Speakers shall respect both the decorum of the meeting and any admonitions as are given them by the meeting's
presiding officer to respect the customary requirements of good taste and proper behavior.
15. Speakers whose speech and/or behavior disrupts the orderly conduct of the public meeting or threatens the public safety
are subject to removal from the meeting by the Sergeant At Arms upon a finding by the meeting's presiding officer that
such speech and/or behavior has clearly violated any of these rules. (Ord. 13-O-06, 3-11-2013)
1-5-4: PRESIDENT OF THE VILLAGE:
There shall be elected a President of the Village, who shall hold his or her office for four (4) years and until his or her successor
is elected and qualified. A person qualified to be elected to the Office of President must: a) be a qualified elector of the Village, b)
be a resident in the Village at least one year next preceding his or her election, c) not have been convicted of any infamous
crime, bribery, perjury or other felony in any court in the United States and, d) not be in debt to the Village.
After his or her election to the Office of Village President, and as permitted by the Illinois Municipal Code at 65 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/1-1-2.1, the person so elected may, at that person's choosing, be referred to as the Mayor of the Village of
Willowbrook rather than the President of the Village of Willowbrook. If any person so elects, that person may sign any official
documents as either Village President or Village Mayor. Moreover, all other correspondence and documents to be signed by
such person may be signed as Village Mayor. Whenever the term "Village President" is used in this Code, it shall be deemed to
refer to the person holding the Office of Village President regardless of whether that person has chosen to be called Village
President or Village Mayor.
The Village President is the Chief Executive Officer of the Village of Willowbrook and, as such, is charged with the duty of seeing
that all laws and ordinances are faithfully enforced. As the Village's Chief Executive Officer responsible for seeing that all laws
and ordinances are enforced, the Village President is effectively the administrative superior of all officers and employees other
than the Village Trustees. As such, the Village President has both the power and the responsibility to require that all Village
officers and employees properly perform their duties. To this end, the Village President at all times may examine and inspect the
books, records and papers of any agent, employee or officer of the Village.
The Village President is a member of the Corporate Authorities and from time to time may, and annually shall, give the Corporate
Authorities information concerning the affairs of the Village and may recommend for their consideration measures the President
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 17/568
believes expedient. The Village President presides at all meetings of the Village Board of Trustees. The Village President does
not vote on any ordinance, resolution or motion except the following: a) where the vote of the Trustees has resulted in a tie; b)
where one-half (1/2) of the Trustees elected have voted in favor of an ordinance, resolution or motion even though there is no tie
vote; or c) where a vote greater than a majority of the Corporate Authorities is required by the Illinois Municipal Code or an
ordinance to adopt an ordinance, resolution or motion. The Village President may veto any ordinance, motion or resolution which
creates a liability against the Village or provides for the expenditure or appropriation of funds. The Village President has the
power to administer oaths or affirmations on all lawful occasions. The Village President, with the advice and consent of the Board
of Trustees, appoints all officers of the Village. The Village President may also remove any officer on a written charge prior to the
end of that officer's term whenever he or she believes the interests of the Village demand removal. The Village President's
removal of an appointed officer is subject to the Board of Trustees' power to thereafter reject such a removal by a two-thirds (2/3)
vote.
The Illinois Liquor Control Act makes the Village President, or his or her designee, the Village's Local Liquor Control
Commissioner, with power to enforce the provisions of the act as well as any local ordinances adopted pursuant thereto. These
powers include examining applicants for liquor licenses to determine their qualifications, holding hearings on alleged violations,
issuing and revoking licenses for violations, imposing fines and suspending a liquor dealer's license.
The Village President may release any person imprisoned for violation of a Village ordinance and shall report the release,
together with the reasons for the release, to the Corporate Authorities at their first meeting after the release.
Subject to the authority of the Governor as Commander in Chief of the Militia, the Village President may call out the militia to aid
in suppressing riots and other disorderly conduct or to aid in carrying into effect any law or ordinance.
Upon receiving a certificate attesting to his or her successful completion of a training course administered by the Illinois Law
Enforcement Training Standards Board, the Village President can exercise all the powers of a conservator of the peace. As a
conservator of the peace, the Village President shall have power: a) to arrest or cause to be arrested, with or without process, all
persons who break the peace or are found violating any Village ordinance or any Criminal Law of the State, b) to commit
arrested persons for examination, c) if necessary, to detain arrested persons in custody overnight or Sunday in any safe place or
until they can be brought before the proper courts, and d) to exercise all other powers as conservators of the peace prescribed
by the Corporate Authorities.
All warrants drawn upon the Village's revenues must be signed by the Village President and countersigned by the Village Clerk
stating the particular fund and the appropriation to which the warrant is chargeable, and the person to whom payable. No money
shall be paid otherwise than upon such warrants so drawn, except as otherwise provided by the Illinois Municipal Code.
The Village President is hereby authorized to sign on behalf of the Village any and all appeal bonds in such amounts and on
such terms as may be fixed by the court, and applications for any appeals which the Village may have taken or may take in the
future and in respect to all proceedings requesting annexation of territory to the Village pursuant to ordinance of the Village
passed in accordance with and pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/7-1-2 et seq.
The Village President is hereby authorized to sign on behalf of the Village a petition requesting a change of venue on any case
in which the Village is a party and in which the Village cannot reasonably expect a fair and impartial trial.
The provisions hereof shall apply to all court proceedings heretofore instituted and hereafter instituted and any and all actions
taken by the Village President on behalf of the Village with respect to requests for change of venue and appeals are hereby
ratified and confirmed in all respects. (Ord. 11-O-22(A), 12-12-2011)
1-5-5: TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:
The Corporate Authorities may elect one of their members to serve as a temporary Chairman in the event the President is
absent from any future meeting of the Board. The Corporate Authorities may also elect one of their members to serve as an
alternate temporary Chairman in the event that the President and the temporary Chairman are both absent from any future
meeting of the Board. In either event, both the temporary Chairman and the alternate temporary Chairman shall have only the
powers of a presiding officer and a right to vote only in the capacity as Trustee on any ordinance, resolution or motion. (Ord. 10-
O-15, 7-26-2010)

(D) Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
1. Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses,
but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
2. Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair, and modify its small wireless facilities in
safe condition, and good repair and compliance with the requirements and conditions of this section. The wireless provider
shall ensure that its employees, agents or contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are
adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. The
wireless provider shall maintain each small wireless facility or small wireless support structure under their control to the
standards imposed by the Village under this section at the time of the granting of its permit. Such maintenance shall
include, but shall not be limited to, maintenance of the paint, structural integrity, and landscaping. If the small wireless
provider fails to maintain the small wireless facility or small wireless support structure, the Village may undertake the
maintenance at the expense of the small wireless provider, or terminate the provider's permit at the Village's sole option.
3. No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications.

cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's
regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public
safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established
by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in
compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as
required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
5. Certain Pole Prohibited: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village owned utility poles that
are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the
electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on
the Village owned utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with
applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric
supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
6. Complying With Applicable Codes: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions,
or regulations that concern public safety.
7. Complying With Stealth, Concealment And Aesthetic Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with generally
applicable written stealth, concealment, and aesthetic standards that are set forth in a subsection (M)3 of this section.

wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna
systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant
shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location
and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
9. Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility
pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not
exceed the higher of:

procedures, terms, and conditions set forth in section 9-14-4, "Variations", of this Code.
14. Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty
(180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay
is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the
site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for
commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the Village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
15. Cooperation With Other Small Wireless Service Providers: As a condition of any permit for installation of a new pole,
small wireless support structure, or other above-ground facility granted pursuant to this section, permittees shall be
required to cooperate with other small wireless providers in collocating additional small wireless facilities on poles and
small wireless support structures owned by the permittee, provided that such proposed additional small wireless provider
been issued permits for that location by the Village as described herein. All permittees shall exercise good faith in
collocating other small wireless providers regarding sharing of the permitted site, provided that such shared use does not
give rise to a substantial technical level of impairment of the ability to provide the permitted use (i.e., significant interference
in broadcast or reception capabilities as opposed to a competitive conflict or financial burden). Such good faith shall
include sharing technical information to evaluate the feasibility of sharing utility poles or small wireless infrastructure. In the
event that a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other users, the Village
may require a third-party technical study at the expense of the applicant, the permittee, or both.

replacement pole shall look substantially the same as existing poles in the surrounding zoning district, subdivision, or
planned development.
(2) Designs To Follow When There Is No Standard: When no design standard is identified for a particular zoning district,
subdivision, or planned development, replacement poles shall match the height, width, color, and material of the
original or adjacent poles. The maximum height of any new or replacement pole shall not exceed limits specified in
subsection (D)9 of this section, subject to any variation requested pursuant to subsection (D)10 of this section. The
Village may, likewise, approve minor variations of up to fifty percent (50%) of the pole width or thirty inches (30"),
whichever is greater, when housing equipment within the pole base.
(3) Placement Near Existing Poles: Replacement poles shall be located as close as possible to the existing pole to be
replaced, and the replaced pole shall be removed.
(4) Internal Cabling: Wherever compatible with the pole design and technologically feasible, all equipment and cabling
shall be internal to the replacement street lighting or traffic signal standard or otherwise camouflaged to appear to be
an integrated part of a utility pole. If equipment or cabling is not proposed to be placed internal to the replacement
pole, a concealment element plan shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (M)3 of this
section.
(5) No Illumination: Small wireless facilities shall not be illuminated.
(6) Generators And Backup Battery: Generators are not permitted for small wireless facilities. All proposed battery
backups must be requested through the submittal of a concealment element plan in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (M)3 of this section.
(7) Cabinet Location And Dimensions: The equipment cabinet for small wireless facilities shall be the smallest amount of
cabinet enclosure necessary to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be located outside of the primary
equipment cabinet.
(8) Flush-Mounting And Pole-Top Antennas: In situations when interior concealment is demonstrated to not be possible,
the small wireless facility shall, to the full extent permitted under the State Electrical Code and the utilities'
requirements, be flush-mounted on the subject pole, which means mounting directly to the pole with little to no gap
other than that which may be required for the screws/bolts, or located at the top of the pole. Canisters attached to the
top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole unless technically required and then shall not be more than fifty
percent (50%) greater than the diameter of the pole.
(9) Antenna Design: Where an enclosure is proposed to house an antenna, the antenna shall be located in an enclosure
of no more than six (6) cubic feet in volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed elements, the antenna and all
of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than six (6) cubic feet. No more than four (4) antennas
are permitted on a single pole and with a total volume not to exceed twenty four (24) cubic feet.
(10) Material And Color: If interior concealment described in subsection (M)2(c)(4) of this section is not possible, the
small wireless facility shall to the maximum extent feasible match the color of the pole and shall be non-reflective.

facility, utility pole, or small wireless support structure shall be placed on or affixed to any utility pole, small wireless
support structure, or small wireless facility other than as required by Federal Communications Commission regulations or
other applicable law. Small wireless facilities concealed within signs or billboards shall not be construed to be in violation
of this prohibition.
3. Concealment Element Plan:
(a) Concealment Element Plan Required: Applications for proposed small wireless facility installations which do not
conform to a preferred concealment technique as identified in subsection (M)2(c) of this section shall submit a
concealment element plan. The plan shall include the design of the screening, fencing, or other concealment technology
for a base station, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the
proposed small wireless facility.
(b) Purpose Of Concealment Element Plan, Generally: Concealment element plans should seek to minimize the visual
obtrusiveness of proposed small wireless facilities using methods including, but not limited to, integrating the installation
with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar
material, color and texture, or the appearance thereof, as the surface or background against which the small wireless
facility will be seen or on which it will be installed. Other concealment element approaches may include, but not be
limited to, use of street furniture concealment products such as trash cans, benches, information kiosks, or other types of

Control Devices for Streets and Highways. (Ord. 63-O-34, 12-23-1963)
8-2-4: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND:
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights successfully one at a time, or with lighted
green or yellow arrows, only the following colors shall be used and such terms and lights and lighted green or yellow arrows shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
(A) Circular green (alone):
1. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
2. Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
(B) Steady yellow:
1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the respective green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
2. Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and no
pedestrian shall start to cross.
(C) Steady red indication:
1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if not, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of an intersection, or if not, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until
an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsections (C)2 and (C)3 of this section.
2. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal at an intersection may turn right after stopping as required by subsection (C)1 of
this section, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully
using the intersection. However, the Village may by ordinance, and the statutes may by rule or regulation, prohibit any such
right turn against a steady red signal at any intersection under its respective jurisdiction. Such ordinance, rule or regulation
shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice prohibiting the right turn.
3. Vehicular traffic on a one-way highway facing a steady red signal may, after stopping as required by subsection (C)1 of this
section, cautiously enter the intersection and make a left turn onto an intersecting one-way highway on which traffic travels
to the left but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully
using the intersection. However, the Village may by ordinance, and the statutes may by rule or regulation, prohibit any such
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

left turn against a steady red signal at any intersection within its respective jurisdiction. Such ordinance or rule or regulation
shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice prohibiting the left turn.
4. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway.
(D) Green straight through arrow (alone):
1. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through, but shall not turn right or left. Such vehicular traffic shall
yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians legally within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.
2. Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within the appropriately marked or unmarked crosswalk.
(E) Green turn arrow (with circular green, with steady yellow, with steady red, or with green straight through arrow):
1. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall comply with the meaning of the circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or green
straight through arrow indication as if it were shown alone, except that such vehicular traffic may cautiously enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the green turn arrow. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
2. Pedestrians facing such signal shall comply with the meaning of the circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or straight
through arrow indication as if it were shown alone.
(F) In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of
this section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall
be at a traffic sign or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, or, in the absence of such sign or
marking, the stop shall be made at the signal. (Ord. 84-O-29, 6-25-1984)

clearly marked stop line, but if not, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at a
point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
(B) Flashing yellow (caution signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may
proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution. (Ord. 84-O-29, 6-25-1984)

the safety of all persons, nor do such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety
of others.

(C) The State of Illinois and the Village, in their respective jurisdictions, may cause official traffic control devices to be placed
within or adjacent to intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this section be
traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection, and where such devices are so placed no driver of a vehicle shall turn a
vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required by such devices.
(D) Where a special lane for making left turns by drivers proceeding in opposite directions has been indicated by official traffic
control devices, allowing for exceptions which are normal traffic engineering standards:
1. A left turn shall not be made from any other lane.
2. A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or when
preparing for or making a U-turn when otherwise permitted by law.

on a parked or disabled vehicle or flashed as a courtesy or "do pass" signal to operators of other vehicles approaching from
the rear. However, such signal devices may be flashed simultaneously on both sides of a motor vehicle to indicate the
presence of a vehicular traffic hazard requiring unusual care in approaching, overtaking or passing.
A stop or turn signal when required herein shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by an electric turn signal
device.
All signals herein required given by hand and arm shall be given from the left side of the vehicle in the following manner and

traffic thereon, and shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian as may be necessary to avoid collision, and upon entering the
roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on such roadway.

of the vehicle on the left must yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.
The right-of-way rule declared above is modified at through highways and otherwise as stated in this chapter.
(B) The driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection of a highway from a highway which terminates at the intersection, not
otherwise regulated by this chapter or controlled by traffic control signs or signals, shall stop, yield and grant the privilege of
immediate use of the intersection to another vehicle which has entered the intersection from the nonterminating highway or is
approaching the intersection on the nonterminating highway in such proximity as to constitute a hazard and after stopping,
may proceed when the driver may safely enter the intersection without interference or collision with the traffic using the
nonterminating highway.
(C) Where stop signs or flashing red signals are in place at an intersection or flashing red signals are in place at a plainly marked
crosswalk between intersections, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk and pedestrians within
or entering the crosswalk at either edge of the roadway shall have the right-of-way over vehicles so stopped. Drivers of
vehicles having so yielded the right-of-way to pedestrians entering or within the nearest crosswalk at an intersection shall
also yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within any other crosswalk at the intersection.
(D) 1. Preferential right-of-way at an intersection may be indicated by stop or yield signs as authorized.
2. Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic-control signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop
intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if not, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. After having stopped, the driver shall yield
the right-of-way to any other vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway or which is approaching so
closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver is moving across or within the
intersection, but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a safe interval occurs.
3. The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the
existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. After slowing or stopping, the driver shall yield the
right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection.
4. If a driver is involved in a collision at an intersection or interferes with the movement of other vehicles after driving past a
yield right-of-way sign, such collision or interference shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield
right-of-way. (Ord. 84-O-29, 6-25-1984)

oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering
with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction of any vehicle overtaken. In every event the
overtaking vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and in the event the passing movement
involves the use of a lane authorized for vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within two hundred feet
(200') of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.
No vehicle shall be driven on the left side of the roadway under the following conditions:
(A) When approaching or upon the crest of a grade or a curve in the highway where the driver's view is obstructed within

where overtaking and passing or driving on the left of the roadway would be especially hazardous and may by appropriate signs
or markings on the roadway indicate the beginning and end of such zones, and when such signs or markings are in place and
clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions thereof.
Where signs or markings are in place to define a no-passing zone as set forth above, no driver may at any time drive on the left
side of the roadway within the no-passing zone or on the left side of any pavement striping designed to mark such no-passing
zone throughout its length.
This section does not apply under the conditions described in subsection 8-4-13(B) of this chapter nor to the driver of a vehicle
turning left into or from a private road or driveway. The pavement striping designed to mark the no-passing zone may be crossed

others consistent herewith shall apply:
(A) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the
driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.
(B) Upon a roadway which is divided into three (3) lanes and provides for two (2) way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be
driven in the center lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction when such
center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation for making a left turn or where such center line is at the
time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction that the vehicle is proceeding and such allocation is designated by
official traffic control devices. (Ord. 84-O-29, 6-25-1984)

the right-of-way and shall immediately drive to a position parallel to, and as close as possible to the right-hand edge or curb of
the highway clear of any intersection and shall stop, if possible, and remain in such position until the authorized emergency
vehicle has passed, except when otherwise directed by a police officer.

thirty (30) miles per hour, or in an alley at a speed in excess of fifteen (15) miles per hour.
Provided, that if the President and Board of Trustees by ordinance, sets other limits as provided by statute after an engineering
or traffic survey, then such limits shall govern the rate of speed on the streets indicated in such ordinances. The Chief of Police
shall post appropriate signs showing such speed limits.
Provided further that the speed of all vehicles of the second division, as defined by statute, having two (2) or more solid tires
shall not exceed ten (10) miles per hour.
The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the
duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when
approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway or when special hazards exist with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speed shall be decreased as may be necessary to
avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all
persons to use due care.
It shall be unlawful to drive any vehicle on any street or highway within the Village under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department
of Transportation, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority or the County of DuPage, at a speed exceeding that lawfully set for
such street.
It is hereby determined upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that the speed permitted by State law upon the
following streets is greater than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to exist upon such streets and it is hereby
declared that the maximum speed limit shall be twenty (20) or twenty five (25) miles per hour as herein set forth on those streets
designated at the times herein specified when signs are erected giving notice thereof:

The Police Department and all members thereof assigned to traffic duty are hereby authorized to remove and tow away or have
removed and towed away by commercial towing service, any car or other vehicle illegally parked in any place where such parked
vehicle creates or constitutes a traffic hazard, blocks the use of a fire hydrant or obstructs or may obstruct the movement of any
emergency vehicle; or any vehicle which has been parked in any public street or other public place for a period of twenty four
(24) consecutive hours.
Cars so towed away shall be stored on any Village property or in a public garage or parking lot and shall be restored to the
owner or operator thereof after payment of the expense incurred by the Village in removing and storing said vehicles. Notice and
an opportunity for hearing to the owner or lien holder in accordance with the applicable general orders of the Police Department
shall be given. (Ord. 63-O-34, 12-23-1963; amd. Ord. 84-O-29, 6-25-1984)
The Chief of Police shall have the right to administratively establish maximum towing and storage fees for any vehicles ordered
towed by the Village, which fees the Chief of Police may revise from time to time. In arriving at said maximum fees, the Chief of
Police shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rate in the area for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage
and area requirements for categories such as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of
work required to perform various types of towing operations. For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or
serious accidents, the Chief of Police is authorized to allow towing service operators to charge rates above those established for
normal situations, which special charges must be based upon the costs of services provided, taking into account such matters as
the man-hours and equipment time required for the job. A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such
a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner of any such
vehicle and to the Police Department. Any such special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for
the nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing service operator and the Police Department shall have available a
copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to
view upon request. However, nothing in this section is intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging
less than the established maximum fees for police ordered or any other tows. (Ord. 85-O-20, 6-10-1985)
8-8-6: PRESUMPTION OF LIABILITY:
Whenever any vehicle shall have been parked in violation of any of the provisions of any ordinance prohibiting or restricting

practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder.

9-8-5: ADOPTION OF STUDIES AND FINDINGS AS TO ADULT BUSINESS USES:
(A) The Village hereby adopts by reference the following studies and case law decisions, including the specific studies and
findings contained therein, as to the negative secondary effects resulting from the location and concentration of adult
business uses within a municipality:
1. St. Paul Division of Planning at the Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board - 1978 study of relationships between
sexually oriented and alcohol oriented adult entertainment business;
2. Minnesota Crime Prevention Center study on the effects of sex oriented and alcohol oriented adult entertainment upon
property values and crime rates - 1980;
3. Indianapolis - 1983 study of sexually oriented businesses and property values;
4. Indianapolis - 1984 "Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis";
5. Phoenix - 1979 "Relation of Criminal Activity and Adult Businesses"; and
6. Northend Cinema, Inc. v. City of Seattle (Supreme Court of Wash., 1978) 90 WASH 2d 709, 585 P.2d 1153.
(B) The Village finds that the negative secondary effects associated with adult business uses, as adopted pursuant to subsection
(A) of this section, are applicable to the location of adult business uses in the Village and that the regulation of adult business
uses is necessary to lessen said negative secondary effects including, but not limited to, lessening the following negative
secondary effects:
1. There is a statistically significant correlation between the location of adult business uses and neighborhood deterioration.
2. That the location of an adult business use in a neighborhood has a negative impact on property value.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 415/568
3. That the negative impact on property values increases when more than one adult business use is located within a given
area.
4. That the effect of adult business uses on the crime rate is positive and significant.
5. That there is a significantly higher crime rate associated with two (2) adult businesses located in a given area than is
associated with only one adult business use in a given area.
6. That adult business uses should be located in areas of the Village which are not in close proximity to residential uses,
schools and other retail business uses as well as areas frequented by minors.
7. That residents of the Village and persons who are nonresidents but use the Village for shopping and other needs will move
from the Village or shop elsewhere if adult business uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential dwellings,
schools or other retail business uses.
8. That the location of adult business uses in a given area creates the perception in the Village that such area is an unsafe
and undesirable part of the Village.
Therefore, adult business uses should be separated from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be
separated from uses with characteristics different from itself. The reasonable regulation of the location of adult business
uses will provide for the protection of the image of the Village and its property values, and protect the residents of the
Village from the negative secondary effects of such business uses, while providing to those who desire to patronize adult
business uses such an opportunity in areas of the Village which are appropriate for location of adult business uses. (Ord.
97-O-05, 1-27-1997)
9-8-6: AMORTIZATION OF EXISTING ADULT BUSINESS USES:

adoption of the amendments to this chapter pertaining to adult business uses shall be considered a nonconforming adult
business use and amortized as hereinafter provided.
On or before December 31, 1997, all nonconforming adult business uses shall be amortized and eliminated.
Thereafter, it shall be unlawful for any nonconforming adult business use to continue the use of or occupy any building except in

use. However, "floor area" for purposes of measurement for off-street parking spaces shall not include:
1. Floor area devoted to off-street parking or loading facilities, including aisles, ramps and maneuvering space.
2. Basement floor area other than area devoted to retailing or service activities, to the production or processing of goods, or
to business or professional offices.
(G) In Yards: Off-street parking spaces, access drives or aisles (including any and all impervious surfaces), open to the sky, may
be located in required interior side yards and rear yards, to within ten feet (10') of the nearest lot line, except a parking area
and drive aisle (including any and all impervious surfaces) containing more than four (4) parking spaces, located within a
residential district adjoining a single-family residential district boundary, or such parking area and drive aisle (including any
and all impervious surfaces) located within a nonresidential district adjoining a residential district boundary, each of which
shall be not less than forty feet (40') from said lot line. Open to the sky off-street parking spaces, access drives or aisles
(including any and all impervious surfaces), may be located in required exterior side and front yards in only nonresidential
districts to within fifteen feet (15') of the nearest lot line.
Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, all parking areas located within a required yard adjacent to
Illinois Route 83 or Plainfield Road shall be set back a minimum of twenty five feet (25') from the property line. A landscaped
earth berm of a minimum three foot (3') height shall be required and appropriately landscaped with densely planted
evergreen trees or shrubs to an effective minimum height of four feet (4') upon installation.
In all non-residential districts, parking shall be permitted in required front, side and/or rear yards, provided that the following
screening and landscaping standards are met:
1. Front Yards And Exterior Side Yards: Permanent peripheral screening at least four feet (4') high shall be constructed and
maintained in front yard and exterior side yard areas adjacent to parking areas. This screening shall consist of a planted
earth berm, densely planted evergreen shrubs or trees or a combination of both.
2. Interior Side And Rear Yards: Permanent peripheral screening at least five feet (5') high shall be constructed and
maintained in interior side and rear yards adjacent to parking areas. This screening shall consist of a planted earth berm,
densely planted evergreen shrubs or trees, or a combination of both. In interior side and rear yards, the screening shall be
so located and constructed as not to interfere or conflict with the use of any utility easement or utility installations existing
or planned to be installed in these easement areas.
3. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping: Landscaped areas shall occupy not less than ten percent (10%) of the remaining site
area excluding areas occupied by buildings or other structures, the required front yard and all street rights-of-way,

vertical, slope ratio.
(b) Parking areas which are wider than one bay of double parking may be landscaped with shade trees planted in
permanent individual planter areas at a minimum ratio of one for every twenty (20) cars. A variety of trees may be used
provided that they are not on the prohibited plant list of the Village and further provided that they do not bear fruit.
Ground cover plants, gravel, mulch or grass shall be installed on the ground.
(H) Collective Provisions: Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces
so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and provided that all regulations
governing location of accessory parking spaces, in relation to the use served, are adhered to.
In mixed use developments, uses with different peak hour demand may share the same parking spaces upon
recommendation of the Plan Commission and approval by the Village Board. A reduction of up to ten percent (10%) of the
total required parking for the individual uses may be allowed for a shared use situation. The applicant must complete and
submit to the Plan Commission an analysis and projection of peak parking demand for the entire development to justify the
sharing of parking spaces for separate uses.
Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, consolidation of required parking spaces shall be encouraged
either by the sharing of spaces where staggered peak hours permit and/or by the interconnecting of driveways to reduce the
number of potential curb cuts that might otherwise be necessary on adjacent streets.
(I) Design And Maintenance:

(e) Credits: Credit against the requirements of this chapter shall be allowed for existing vegetation and other landscape
features of a quality and of a size as required by this subsection (D)2 which the applicant proposes to preserve and/or
enhance on an equal basis. In all cases, the Zoning Officer may attach such conditions to the granting of the credits
provided for herein as may serve to secure or enhance the continued well being of all vegetation for which credit is being
given during the period of construction upon the site covered by the plan. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997)
(f) Landscape Screening Requirements For Aboveground Service Facilities: Aboveground service facilities shall be

to the end that such required landscaping shall not adversely affect any improvement or structure limited to required
stormwater management or detention or other public utilities located upon the site. It shall be an objective of this title that

adjacent parcels of property.
4. Substitutions And Deviations: Once a landscape plan has been approved and a zoning certificate issued, the Zoning
Officer may authorize minor deviations from the approved landscape plan including the substitution of equivalent approved
plantings and ground covers and the relocation of required plantings where such deviations do not substantially diminish
the intended benefits of the approved landscape plan. As such, deviations and/or substitutions shall require the written
approval of the Zoning Officer.
5. Additional Requirements: All landscaping as required in this chapter shall be in addition to all other landscaping
requirements contained within this title including, but not limited to, such provisions as parkway landscaping, parkway

(E) Issuance Of Zoning Certificate: A zoning certificate shall be either issued or refused by the Zoning Officer within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of an application thereof, or within such further period as may be agreed to by the applicant; provided,
however, that the Zoning Officer shall have a period of forty five (45) days within which to issue or refuse a zoning certificate
on all applications which are required to comply with the provisions of subsection (A) of this section. When the Zoning Officer
refuses to issue a zoning certificate, he shall advise the applicant in writing of the reasons for refusal. (Ord. 87-O-20, 5-11-
1987; amd. Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997)
(F) Period Of Validity: A zoning certificate shall become null and void six (6) months after the date on which it is issued unless,
within such six (6) month period, construction, moving, remodeling or reconstruction of a structure is commenced or a use is
commenced. (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977; amd. Ord. 83-O-5, 2-14-1983)
(G) Occupancy Permits: No structures or additions thereto constructed, moved, remodeled or reconstructed after the effective
date of this chapter shall be occupied or used for any purpose, and no land vacant on the effective date of this chapter shall
be used for any other use, unless an occupancy permit shall first have been obtained from the Village certifying that the
proposed use or occupancy complies with all provisions of this title. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997)

certificate is required shall be filed with the Director of Municipal Services and be in such form and contain such information
as the Director of Municipal Services shall provide by general rule. (Ord. 82-O-52, 10-25-1982; amd. Ord. 83-O-5, 2-14-1983;

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 476/568
(I) Application For Occupancy Permits For Industrial Uses: All applications for an occupancy permit for any industrial use to be
located in the L-O-R Limited Office and Research District or M-1 Light Manufacturing District, where no zoning certificate is
required, shall be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the Director of Municipal Services to determine that all
applicable performance standards of chapter 9 of this title can and will be complied with at all times. At the request of the
Director of Municipal Services, the applicant shall provide such information as is specified in chapter 9 of this title.
(J) Issuance Of Occupancy Permit: No occupancy permit for a structure or addition thereto constructed, moved, remodeled or
reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter shall be issued until such work has been completed, including off street
parking and loading spaces, and the premises have been inspected by the Director of Municipal Services and determined to
be in full and complete compliance with the plans and specifications upon which the issuance of the zoning certificate was
based. No occupancy permit for a new use of any structure or land shall be issued until the premises have been inspected by
the Director of Municipal Services and determined to be in full and complete compliance with all the applicable regulations for
the zoning district in which it is located. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy permit, a temporary occupancy
permit may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six (6) months from its date of issuance pending the completion of
any addition or during partial occupancy of the premises. In the event that any construction or building as to which a
temporary occupancy permit has been issued has not been fully completed so as to comply with all applicable Village
ordinances at the end of the six (6) month period, the Director of Municipal Services may cause said premises to be vacated
and to remain vacated until full compliance with all applicable ordinances of the Village has been obtained. An occupancy
permit shall be issued or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued
within fourteen (14) days after the receipt of an application therefor; or after the Director of Municipal Services is notified in
writing that the structures or premises are ready for occupancy; provided, however, that the Director of Municipal Services
shall have a period of twenty one (21) days within which to issue or refuse an occupancy permit on all applications which are
required to comply with the provisions of subsection (I) of this section. All occupancy permits shall be executed by the
Director of Municipal Services, and any one of the following persons, or, in the absence of the Director of Municipal Services,
both the following persons:
1. Village Administrator;
2. Zoning Officer.
In the event that any of the conditions under which a temporary occupancy permit is issued are violated during the term of
said temporary occupancy permit, the Director of Municipal Services may cause the premises in question to be vacated
and to remain vacated until full compliance with all such conditions is obtained.
(K) Escrow Deposits: Whenever an application for a zoning certificate or occupancy permit for a new or altered structure or
industrial use to be located in the L-O-R Limited Office and Research District or M-1 Light Manufacturing District indicates, in
the opinion of the Director of Municipal Services, that the operations or activities to be conducted may violate the
performance standards of chapter 9 of this title, the Director of Municipal Services shall, as a condition precedent to issuing a
zoning certificate or occupancy permit, require the deposit in escrow of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to be
held by the Director of Municipal Services for a period of one year after the date that such new or altered use is commenced.
If during such one year period or at any time in the future the Director of Municipal Services believes that there is a
reasonable probability that the regulations of chapter 9 of this title are being violated, he may employ a qualified technician or
technicians to perform investigations, measurements and analyses to determine whether or not the regulations of chapter 9
of this title are, in fact, being violated and may pay his or their reasonable fees out of the aforementioned escrow deposit,
regardless of the outcome of the investigation. If reasonable fees of such technician or technicians exceed the amount of any
available escrow deposit, and if a violation of chapter 9 of this title is discovered, the fees may be recovered as a penalty in
the same manner as, in addition to, the penalties specified in chapter 17 of this title. Escrow deposits or remainders of
escrow deposits shall be returned to the depositors at the expiration of the escrow period. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997; amd.
Ord. 05-O-32, 11-14-2005)
9-14-3: APPEALS:
(A) Scope And Commencement Of Appeals: An appeal from any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Officer made in interpreting this title may be taken to the Plan Commission by any person, firm or corporation aggrieved by
said decision or by any officer, department or board of the Village. Such appeal shall be taken within forty five (45) days of
the ruling by the Zoning Officer, by filing with the Zoning Officer a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, and by
filing said appeal and a copy of said notice of appeal with the Secretary of the Plan Commission. The Zoning Officer shall
forthwith transmit to the Secretary of the Plan Commission all of the papers constituting the records upon which he made the
decision from which appeal has been taken. The notice of appeal and the appeal itself shall be filed in such number of
copies, be in such form and contain such information as the Plan Commission may provide from time to time by general rule.
(B) Action On Appeals: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the decision appealed from unless the Zoning
Officer certifies to the Plan Commission after notice of appeal has been filed with him that, by reasons of facts stated in the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 477/568
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Plan Commission or by a court of record upon
application following notice to the Zoning Officer and upon due cause shown. The Plan Commission shall select a reasonable
time, no more than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of an appeal, and place for the public hearing on the appeal,
shall give due notice thereof to the parties having a known interest therein and shall render a written decision without
unreasonable delay. Upon the concurring vote of a majority of members then holding office, the Plan Commission may
reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may amend or modify the decision from which the appeal was taken, subject to the
provisions contained in this title or applicable Illinois Statutes, and to that end, the Plan Commission shall have the powers of
the Zoning Officer with respect to such decisions. (Ord. 97-O-10, 4-14-1997)

purpose and intent as will not be contrary to the public interest. Variations may be recommended only in those specific
instances enumerated in subsection (D) of this section and then only when the Plan Commission has made findings of fact,
based upon the standards set out in subsection (E) of this section, that owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this title will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulties or a particular hardship for the owner, lessee

without delay a copy of each to the Secretary of the Plan Commission. The application shall contain the following information,
as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Plan Commission: (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977; amd.
Ord. 97-O-10, 4-14-1997)
1. The particular requirements of this title which prevent the proposed use or construction;
2. The characteristics of the subject property which prevent compliance with said requirements of this title;
3. The reduction of the minimum requirements of this title which would be necessary to permit the proposed use or
construction; and
4. The practical difficulty or particular hardship which would result if said particular requirements of this title were applied to
the subject property. (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977)
(C) Hearing And Notice: The Plan Commission shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing, which is no more than
ninety (90) days from the date a complete application for a variation is received by the Zoning Officer. Public notice of such
hearing shall be given in accordance with section 9-15-3 of this title. The commission may give such additional notice as it
may, from time to time, by rule provide. Any party in interest may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or
by attorney. Any delay in the conducting of the aforesaid public hearing necessitated or requested by the applicant shall not
be charged against the ninety (90) day period set forth herein.
(D) Authorized Variations: Variations from the regulations of this title shall be recommended by the Plan Commission and
granted by the Board of Trustees only in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection (E) of this section and may be

more than one dwelling unit per acre in addition to the number that would be permitted by strict application of the
minimum lot area requirements. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997)
2. To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including maximum height, lot coverage and floor area ratio and minimum yard

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 478/568
(E) Standards For Variations: The Plan Commission shall not recommend and the Board of Trustees shall not grant variations
from the regulations of this title unless affirmative findings of fact shall be made as to all of the standards hereinafter set forth,
which findings of fact shall be based upon evidence adduced upon the hearing held thereon, that: (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977;
amd. Ord. 97-O-10, 4-14-1997)
1. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
2. The proposed variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and
unusual hardship which will result if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out and which is not generally applicable
to property within the same district.
3. The alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having a proprietary interest in the premises.
4. The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood.
5. The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase
congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety.
6. The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of the locality. (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977)
7. The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent of this title. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997)
The Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the location, construction, design and use of the
property benefited by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the foregoing standards and to protect
adjacent property and property values. (Ord. 77-O-4, 2-14-1977)
(F) Decisions On Variations: The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Plan Commission then holding office shall be
necessary to recommend the grant of a variation to the Board of Trustees. Any recommendation that a variation be granted
shall be accompanied by a conclusion or statement of the relief to be granted, supported by findings of fact, which statement
and findings shall be transmitted to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall make a final determination as to
whether or not any variation requested shall be granted. Should the Board of Trustees not make a final determination within
eighteen (18) months from the date of the public hearing, as a result of any action or inaction of the applicant, it will be
necessary for the owner to refile his application or file an amended form of said application and follow the same procedure as
required for a new application, including the payment of all requisite fees. The decision of the Board of Trustees shall be
supported by a statement containing specific findings of fact, which findings shall specify the reason or reasons for granting
the variation and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and specifications for the proposed variation which have been
made part of the application or which were introduced at the public hearing as evidence. Such exhibits shall remain part of
the permanent record of the Plan Commission. The terms of relief granted shall be specifically set forth in said conclusion or
statement separate from the findings of fact. All variations granted pursuant to this authority shall be granted in conformance
with the Statutes of the State of Illinois. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997; amd. Ord. 97-O-10, 4-14-1997; Ord. 99-O-10, 5-24-1999)
Notwithstanding any provision contained in this section to the contrary, the Board of Trustees shall not take final action on an
application for variation if the property that is the subject of the application is determined by the Director of Municipal Services
to be in violation of any provision of this Code. (Ord. 97-O-05, 1-27-1997; amd. Ord. 97-O-10, 4-14-1997; Ord. 05-O-32, 11-
14-2005)
(G) Period Of Validity: No decision granting a variation shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months from the date of
such decision unless:
1. An application for a zoning certificate is obtained within such period and construction, reconstruction, moving and
remodeling is started, or
2. An occupancy certificate is obtained and a use is commenced.
The Board of Trustees may grant additional extensions of time not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days each, upon
written application made within the initial twelve (12) month period without further notice or hearing, but said right to so
extend said time shall not include the right to grant additional relief by expanding the scope of the variation. (Ord. 77-O-4,

permitted in some districts, then, as special uses rather than a regularly permitted use, and only after public hearing and
the adoption of an ordinance by the Board of Trustees authorizing such special use and containing such conditions as
more fully set forth in subsection (D) of this section.
2. Application And Hearing: An application for a special use permit shall be processed similarly to that of a petition for
variance, as provided in subsection 9-14-4(B) of this chapter, excepting that:
(a) The hearing body shall be the Plan Commission;
(b) The Plan Commission shall make specific findings of fact with respect to the applicant's compliance with the standards

(C) Preparation: The sketch plan should be drawn to scale and show the arrangements of lots, blocks and streets. Dimensions of
all lots shall be shown, but may be approximated. It is the intent of this chapter that the sketch plan need not be done in
precisely engineered plans but be only in sufficient detail to permit planning review. At this stage, the subdivider should
expect that the Zoning Officer may require major alterations to be made in the plat if it is found necessary.
It is not necessary that the sketch plan be prepared by and sealed by a registered land surveyor; provided, however, that the
outside dimensions of the plat shall be based upon an accurate boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor.

(E) Recommendations For Conformation:
1. The review by the Plan Commission of the sketch plan is strictly advisory, involving merely a general opinion of the plan as
submitted, and is not binding on the Village.
2. The Plan Commission may recommend such changes or revisions to the plan as it deems necessary in order for the plan
to conform to the purpose, intent and requirements of these subdivision regulations.
(F) Sketch Plan Not Mandatory: The sketch plan option provided for in this section is provided as a convenience to the
subdivider and is not mandatory, except for a proposed development that is a planned unit development, in which case it
shall be mandatory. In addition, for proposed subdivisions containing more than eight (8) lots, it is strongly recommended that
the subdivider go through the sketch plan process.
The sketch plan review process shall not be deemed to cause the commencement of the statutory time limitations set forth in
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8. (Ord. 05-O-17, 6-13-2005)

person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the
original charge for delivering the electricity.
3. Any such tax required to be collected, and any such tax in fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the Village by the
person delivering the electricity, provided, that the person delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to

thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.

delivers the electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a sale for resale.
(a) If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply
to the appropriate governmental body or agency for a resale number. Such person shall provide the Village with a copy
of said resale number and shall furnish such additional information as the Village may reasonably require to demonstrate
that such person is not liable for the tax imposed by this chapter on any purchases of electricity. Upon receipt of such
information, the Village shall issue confirmation of such person's status as a reseller under this chapter.
(b) The Village may revoke such person's status as a reseller under this chapter if the person fails to pay any tax payable
under this chapter for electricity used or consumed by the person; if the number was obtained through
misrepresentation; and/or if the number is no longer necessary because the person has discontinued making resales.
(c) If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax
imposed pursuant to this chapter directly to the Village as to the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes,
and shall collect and remit said tax as to the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.
(d) Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale number and complying with all other conditions
of this section shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity delivered to the
reseller, provided that the person reports to the Village the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such
other information that the Village may reasonably require. (Ord. 98-O-22, 7-13-1998)

years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any

company's application for franchise or application for renewal that are finally negotiated and accepted by the Village and the
company.
(B) Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained herein shall be consistent with Federal and State laws and
regulations.
(C) Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general provisions of this chapter now in effect or hereafter made
effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the Village regarding permits, fees to be paid
or manner of construction.
(D) The company shall acknowledge that its rights under this chapter and the franchise are subject to the police power of the
Village to adopt and enforce generally applicable ordinances necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the public; and
the company shall agree to comply with all generally applicable laws and ordinances enacted by the Village pursuant to such
power. (Ord. 00-O-12, 5-8-2000)
13-1-6: REQUIREMENT OF A FRANCHISE:
No person shall construct, install, maintain, or operate a cable system within the Village, or within any public ways of the Village,
unless a franchise has first been obtained pursuant to this chapter, and unless such franchise is in full force and effect. Such
franchise shall not take the place of any other license or permit which may be legally required of the company in order to conduct
such a business, or to construct or install buildings, structures, facilities, or equipment within the Village. (Ord. 00-O-12, 5-8-
2000)
13-1-7: FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE; LIMITING NUMBER OF FRANCHISES:
(A) Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The Village may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable Federal
and State law. Village may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the
requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations such as:
1. The capacity of the public ways to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=449 543/568
2. The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on
residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way.
(B) In the event the Village grants an additional franchise to use and occupy the public ways for the purpose of operating a cable
system, said additional franchise should only be granted under the same terms and conditions as those imposed on the
company previously granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to avoid the
Village's receipt of redundant or outdated equipment, to the extent that the company previously granted such a franchise has
provided specific equipment in satisfaction of its obligation to support public, educational or governmental programming, the
Village may require the subsequent franchisee to provide alternative equipment, providing that the total financial commitment
for said equipment is equal to that provided by the previously granted franchise. (Ord. 00-O-12, 5-8-2000)
13-1-8: FRANCHISE AREA:
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the franchise area for any franchise granted by the Village shall be the corporate

13-1-9: TERM OF THE FRANCHISE:

and after the effective date of the franchise agreement, and the same shall continue in full force and effect for the term specified
in the franchise agreement unless otherwise extended, terminated or revoked for cause as allowed pursuant to the provisions of

constitutional or statutory provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond that it has been issued under provisions of
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-74/1 et seq., and this chapter, and that it does not constitute an indebtedness of the Village or

purchase, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment and extension of a like project, or the issuance of bonds for like
purposes, and without regard to the requirements, restrictions, limitations, or other provisions contained in any other law. (Ord.
