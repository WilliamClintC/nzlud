7.0 PURPOSE.
The industrial District regulations are intended to govern the location, intensity and method of development
of the industrial areas of Bridgeview. The regulations are designed to provide for the grouping together of industries
that are compatible to one another and that are not objectionable to the community as a whole. The regulations
preserve lands for industrial and allied uses and prohibit the intrusion of residential and other non-compatible uses
into the industrial area. The performance of the industrial uses is regulated by establishing standards for the external
effects of noise, smoke, vibration and other potential nuisances. It is not the purpose or intent of the I-2A zoning
classification, or the Zoning Ordinance in general, to impose any limitations or restrictions on the content of any
communicative materials, or to deny access to any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States
Constitution or the Constitution of the State of Illinois. All industrial uses are contained in the following three

of this Section, and which remains or becomes non-conforming upon the adoption of this
Section, or any amendment hereto, may be continued for a period of one (1) year from
the adoption of this Section or such amendment hereto, and may be continued thereafter
only in strict conformance with the regulations set forth above.
8.3 LOTS.
8.31 Number of buildings on a lot. Except in the case of a planned development, not more than one

8.36 Lots without street frontage. Every structure or group of structures, and every use or group of
uses, shall be located upon a lot. Where unique land planning designs are employed in a
subdivision or planned development to conserve the natural character of the land or to create a
functional or compatible arrangement of structures or uses, a lot which does not abut upon a public
or private street may be permitted, provided that:

street widening.
8.44 Required setbacks. Minimum setbacks on lots abutting a street or thoroughfare shall be the
distance required for a front yard, or side yard adjoining a street. In the districts where such lots

11.1 Procedure
11.2 Standards for Planned Developments
11.3 Conditions on Planned Developments
11.4 Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions; Fee
11.5 Effect of Approval of a Planned Development
11.6 Limitations on Planned Development Permits
11.7 Amendments to Planned Development Permits
11.0 PURPOSE.
Planned developments are a distinct category of special use. The planned development technique is
intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise applicable substantive requirements based upon procedural protections
providing for detailed review of individual proposals for significant developments. This special regulatory
technique is included in recognition of the fact that traditional use, bulk, space, and yard regulations which may be
useful in protecting the character of substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriate preregulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas that lend themselves to an
individual, planned approach. Through the flexibility of the planned development technique, the Village seeks to
achieve the following specific objectives:
11.01 Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible through strict application of
other Village land use regulations.
11.02 Efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets while lowering
development and housing costs.
11.03. Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in
better design and development, including aesthetic amenities.
11.04 Combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships.
11.05 Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography,
vegetation, and geologic features, and the prevention of soil erosion.
11.06 Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space.
11.07 An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result from the application of
conventional subdivision and zoning regulations.
11.08 Encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
11.1 PROCEDURE.
11.11 Application. Applications for a planned development shall be filed with the Zoning, Planning and
Development Commission and shall contain a Final Plan detailing:
A. categories of uses to be permitted; and
B. general location of residential and nonresidential land uses; and
C. overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of nonresidential uses; and
11-2
D. the general architectural style of the proposed development; and
E. general location and extent of public and private open space including recreational
amenities; and
F. general location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems; and
G. staging of development; and
H. nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements, or contributions to be
provided by the applicant.
11.12 Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the Zoning, Planning and
Development Commission.
11.13 Subdivision. When a subdivision of land is proposed in connection with a planned development,
review of the final plat of the proposed subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously with
review of the Final Plan.
11.14 Action by Zoning, Planning and Development Commission. Within 60 days after the conclusion
of the public hearing, the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission shall transmit to the
Mayor and Board of Trustees its recommendation either granting the application for planned
development; granting the application subject to conditions, or denying the application. The
failure of the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission to act within such 60 days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the denial of
the proposed planned development.
11.15 Action by Mayor and Board of Trustees. Within 45 days after the receipt of the recommendation
of the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission, or its failure to act as above provided, the
Mayor and Board of Trustees shall either deny the application or, by ordinance duly passed, shall
approve the planned development, with or without modifications or conditions. The failure of the
Mayor and Board of Trustees to act within such 45 days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed a decision denying the planned development.
11.2 STANDARDS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
No planned development shall be granted pursuant to this Section unless the application shall establish that:
11.21 Special Use Permit Standards. The proposed development will meet each of the standards made
applicable to special uses pursuant to Article XII of the Zoning Ordinance.
11.22 Unified Ownership Required. The entire property proposed for planned development treatment
shall be in single ownership or under such unified control as to ensure that the entire property will
be developed as a unified whole. All owners of the property shall be included as joint applicants
on all applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any owner as to any
tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owners and all tracts.
11.23 Minimum Area. The district regulations of the Zoning Ordinance establishing standards for
particular types of planned developments specify the minimum area required for some planned
developments. In addition to meeting that specific standard, or where no specific standard is set,
the applicant shall have the burden of establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and
shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole capable of meeting the objectives for which
planned developments may be established pursuant to this Section.
11.24 Covenants and Restrictions to be Enforceable by Village. All covenants, deed restrictions,
easements, and similar restrictions to be recorded in connection with the planned development
shall provide that they may not be modified, removed, or released without the express consent of
11-3
the Mayor and Board of Trustees and that they may be enforced by the Village as well as by future
landowners within the proposed development.
11.25 Public Open Space and Contributions. Whenever the development will create a need for land for
public purposes of the Village within the proposed planned development, the Mayor and Board of
Trustees may require that such area be designated and to the extent such need is specifically and
uniquely attributable to the proposed development, dedicated to the Village for such use. In
addition, the Mayor and Board of Trustees may require evidence that all requirements of Village
ordinances pertaining to the dedication of land or the contribution of cash in connection with
subdivisions or developments of land have been met as respects the proposed planned
development, whether or not such proposed development would be otherwise subject to such
ordinances.
11.26 Common Open Space.
A. Amount, Location, and Use. The failure of a planned development to provide common
open space shall be considered to be an indication that it has not satisfied the objectives
for which such developments may be approved pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance.
When common open space is provided in a planned development, the amount and
location of such open space shall be consistent with its intended function as set forth in
the application and planned development plans. No such open space shall be used for the
construction of any structure or improvement except such structures and improvements
as may be approved in the Final Plan as appropriate to the intended leisure and
recreational uses for which such open space is intended.
B. Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants or dedication of
development rights, shall be provided to prevent the subsequent use of common open
space for any use, structure, improvement, or development other than that shown on the
approved Final Plan. The restrictions must be permanent and not for a given period of
years and must run with the land.
C. Ownership and Maintenance. The Final Plan shall include such provisions for the
ownership and maintenance of such open space and improvements as are reasonably
necessary to ensure their continuity, care, conservation, maintenance, and operation in
accordance with predetermined standards and to ensure that remedial measures will be
available to the Village if such open space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate
or are not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the planned
development or the Village.
D. Property Owners' Association. When the requirements of the preceding Subparagraph
are to be satisfied by the ownership or maintenance of such open space or improvements
by a property owners' association, such association shall meet each of the following
standards:
1. the by-laws and rules of the association and all declarations, covenants, and
restrictions to be recorded must be approved as part of the Final Plan prior to
becoming effective. Each such document shall provide that it shall not be amended
in any manner that would result in it being a violation of the requirements of this
subparagraph; and
2. the association must be established and all covenants and restrictions must be
recorded prior to the sale of any property within the area of the planned development
designated to have the exclusive use of the proposed open space or improvements;
and
3. the association must be responsible for casualty and liability insurance, taxes, and the
maintenance of the open space and improvements to be deeded to it; and
11-4
4. membership in the association must be mandatory for each property owner and any
successive owner having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open space or
improvements; and
5. every property owner having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open space or
improvements must pay its pro rata share of the cost of the association by means of
an assessment to be levied by the association that meets the requirements for
becoming a lien on the property in accordance with statutes of the State of Illinois;
and
6. the association must have the right to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.
The membership vote required to authorize such adjustment shall not be fixed at
more than two-thirds of the members voting on the issue; and
7. the Village must be given the right to enforce the covenants; and
8. the Village must be given the right, after 10 days' written notice to the association, to
perform any maintenance or repair work that the association has neglected to
perform, to assess the membership for such work and to have a lien against the
property for any member failing to pay such assessment. For this purpose alone, the
Village shall have all the rights and powers of the association and its governing body
under the agreements and declarations creating the association.
11.27 Landscaping and Perimeter Treatment. Any area of a planned development not used for structures
or circulation elements shall be landscaped or otherwise improved. The perimeter of the planned
development shall be treated so as to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses by means such as
provision of compatible uses and structures, setbacks, screening, or natural or man-made buffers.
Every planned development having 20 or more acres shall provide a perimeter landscaped open
space along each of its boundaries; each such open space shall have a minimum depth equal to the
minimum front yard required in the district in which it is located or which it abuts, whichever is
greater.
11.28 Private Streets and Sidewalks. Private streets are prohibited unless expressly approved by the
Mayor and Board of Trustees. If so approved, they shall meet all construction standards
applicable to public streets. No such streets shall be approved except upon the condition that they
shall be owned and maintained by a property owners' association. A sidewalk shall be provided
along at least one side of every street in or abutting a planned development; provided, however,
that such sidewalk may be constructed in a street right-of-way or as a specific element of the
design of the planned development.
11.29 Utilities. All utility lines shall be installed underground.
11.3 CONDITIONS ON PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
The Zoning, Planning and Development Commission may recommend and the Mayor and Board of
Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping,
screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of the Zoning Ordinance upon the premises
benefited by a planned development as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon
other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services;
provided, however, that such conditions shall not be used as a device to approve a planned development that is
intended to be temporary in nature. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the
planned development. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of the Zoning Ordinance
and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the planned development approval.
11-5
11.4 AFFIDAVIT OF COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS; FEE.
Whenever any planned development granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an affidavit with the
Director of Buildings and Inspectional Services so stating. Such affidavit shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
fee, to be fixed in each case by the Director of Buildings and Inspectional Services, to recover the Village's actual
direct cost of an inspection to verify that such conditions and limitations have been met.
11.5 EFFECT OF APPROVAL OF A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
The approval of a planned development shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely
authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by
the codes and ordinances of the Village.
11.6 LIMITATIONS ON PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
Subject to an extension of time granted by the Director of Buildings and Inspectional Services no permit for
a planned development shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a
Certificate of Occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that period.
A planned development permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued,
and such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be
discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance approving a planned development, a planned
development permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and property in question rather
than the owner or operator of such use or property
11.7 AMENDMENTS TO PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
A planned development permit may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and
subject to the standards and limitations provided in this Article for its original approval.

the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence.

be carried out;

adjacent property; or substantially increase the danger of fire, or otherwise endanger

and intent of this ordinance.

12.8 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
12.82 PURPOSE. Special uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness that require a
careful review of their location, design, configuration, and special impact to determine, against
fixed standards, the desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses
that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing, in each case,
of the public need and benefit against the local impact and effect.
12.83 Procedure.
A. Application. Applications for special use permits shall be filed with the Zoning, Planning
and Development Commission.
B. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the Zoning,

conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission
shall transmit to the Mayor and Board of Trustees its recommendation either granting the
application for a special use permit; granting the application subject to conditions, or
denying the application. The failure of the Zoning, Planning and Development
Commission to act within such 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the denial of the proposed special use
permit.
D. Action by Mayor and Board of Trustees. Within 45 days after the receipt of the
recommendation of the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission, or its failure to
act as above provided, the Mayor and Board of Trustees shall either deny the application
or, by ordinance duly passed, shall grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Mayor and Board of Trustees to act within
such 45 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a
decision denying the special use permit.
12.84 Standards for Special Use Permits. No special use permit shall be granted pursuant to this Section
unless the applicant shall establish that:
A. Code and Plan Purposes. The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the
general and specific purposes for which the Zoning Ordinance was enacted and for which
the regulations of the district in question were established.
B. No Undue Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will not have a
substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of the area, or
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
12-10
C. No Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use and development
will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity
or to interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in accordance with
the applicable district regulations.
D. Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will be served adequately
by essential public facilities and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage
structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or the
applicant will provide adequately for such services.
E. No Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will not cause undue traffic
congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through residential streets.
F. No-Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and development will not
result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of
significant importance.
G. Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development complies with all
standards imposed on that use and any district where it is a permitted use.
12.85 Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence establishes that the foregoing
standards have been met, the Zoning, Planning and Development Commission shall consider:
A. Public Benefit. Whether and to what extent, the proposed use and development at the
particular location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility
that is in the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to the general
welfare of the neighborhood or community.
B. Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent, such public goals can be met by the
location of the proposed use and development at some other site or in some other area
that may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
C. Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent, all steps possible have been
taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use and development on the
immediate vicinity through building design, site design, landscaping, and screening.
12.86 Conditions on Special Use Permits. The Zoning, Planning and Development Commission may
recommend and the Mayor and Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of the Zoning Ordinance upon the premises benefited by a
special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon
other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities
and services; provided, however, that such conditions shall not be used as a device to grant a
permit for a special use that is intended to be temporary in nature. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of the Zoning Ordinance and shall constitute grounds for revocation
of the special use permit.
Whenever any special use permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an
affidavit with the Director of Buildings and Inspectional Services so stating. Such affidavit shall
be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, to be fixed in each case by the Director of Buildings and
Inspectional Services, to recover the Village's actual direct cost of an inspection to verify that such
conditions and limitations have been met.
12-11
12.87 Effect of Issuance of Special Use Permit. The grant of a special use permit shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation,
filing, and processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the
codes and ordinances of the Village.
12.88 Limitations on Special Use Permits Subject to an extension of time granted by the Director of
Buildings and Inspectional Services no special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than
one year unless a Building Permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period
and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued
and a use commenced within that period.
A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued,
and such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall,
for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance granting a special use permit, a special use
permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and property in question
rather than the owner or operator of such use or property.

only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards and limitations provided in this
Section for its original approval.
