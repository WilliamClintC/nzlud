By the tenth day after the appealable decision, the applicant or permittee must notify the City Clerk by email, fax, or in person, of the decision whether the proposal to mediate was accepted or refused. The failure of the applicant or permittee to respond within these timelines shall be deemed a refusal to mediate.

C.    If mediation is elected, the parties shall agree upon a neutral third party mediator. The complaining party shall be responsible for all costs, if any, of the mediation unless the parties agree to another payment arrangement.

D.    The mediation process begins when the decision is made. If the proposal to mediate is accepted, the entire mediation process shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the decision.

E.    This section shall not apply to appeals by city officials, pursuant to Section 8.136.040, or to appeals by applicants or permittees. (Ord. 2-08 § 1)


1.04.050 Appeal to City Manager or City Council.

A.    Any person excepting to the denial, suspension or revocation of a permit or license applied for or held by him pursuant to any of the provisions of this code, or to any administrative decision made by any official of the city pursuant to any of the provisions of this code, may appeal to the City Manager or City Council, as the case may be, when the right to appeal is specifically so provided in this code by reference to this section, by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk, setting forth the specific grounds thereof. If Section 1.04.045 applies, the written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposal to mediate and a letter from the mediator indicating that mediation was conducted and the date the mediation was conducted, or, if there was no mediation, a copy of the refusal. In the event that no written response to the proposal to mediate was made, the written notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposal to mediate and a declaration signed under penalty of perjury attesting that the complaining party received no response to the proposal to mediate.

B.    Notice of such appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date written notice of such action appealed from was mailed or personally delivered to the appellant, but in no event later than twenty (20) calendar days after the date of such action; provided, however, that if Section 1.04.045 applies and mediation has been accepted, any appeal must be filed within three (3) days of the date that the mediation ended.

C.    The City Clerk shall forthwith set a date for hearing before either the City Council or City Manager, as the case may be, and shall give the appellant at least five (5) calendar days’ notice of the time and place of said hearing.

D.    At such hearing the appellant shall show cause on the grounds specified in the notice of appeal why the action excepted to should not be approved. The City Manager or City Council, as the case may be, may continue the hearing from time to time. The findings on the appeal shall be final and conclusive in the matter. (Ord. 2-08 § 2: Ord. 21-86 § 7; Ord. 13 § 1 (part), 1982)


1.04.060 Judicial review of administrative decision.

Any interested person seeking judicial review pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) Section 1094.5 of any final decision, as defined in CCP Section 1094.6(e), of the City Council or any boards, commissions, officers, agents or employees of the city empowered to make such decisions may do so only if the petition for writ of mandate pursuant to CCP Section 1094.5 is filed within the time limits specified in CCP Section 1094.6. (Ord. 21-86 § 8; Ord. 13 § 1 (part), 1982)


1.04.061 Recovery of nuisance abatement costs incurred by the city.

A.    The total cost for abating a nuisance, as confirmed by resolution of the City Council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates. The Administrative Services Director shall record in the office of the County Recorder a notice of lien, based on the resolution, which shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such assessment.

B.    When the assessment has been so confirmed and recorded, the Administrative Services Director shall send by certified mail and by first-class U.S. mail, postage prepaid, a notice to the property owner stating the following: (1) that a special assessment is being imposed on the property, (2) the amount of the special assessment, (3) that the special assessment will be collected along with, and in the same manner as, ordinary ad valorem property taxes, and (4) that the property may be sold after three (3) years by the tax collector if the special assessment is not paid.

C.    After such confirmation, recordation and notice, the Administrative Services Director shall file a certified copy of the Council’s resolution with the Alameda County Auditor-Controller on or before August 1st, whereupon it shall be the duty of the Auditor-Controller to add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against the respective lots and parcels of land and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.

D.    Where payment of an assessment on a vacant residential developed property is delinquent, the city may conduct a sale of such property, subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code Section 3691. 

E.    In addition to the remedy described in this section and any other remedy contained in the Dublin Municipal Code, the city expressly reserves the right to utilize enforcement remedies available under any applicable state or federal statute or pursuant to any other lawful power the city may possess to recover the costs of nuisance abatement. All such remedies shall be alternative to or in conjunction with, and not exclusive of, one another. (Ord. 28-08 § 1)


1.04.062 Recovery of attorney fees for nuisance abatement actions or proceedings.

In any action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding initiated by the city to abate a nuisance, the prevailing party may recover attorneys’ fees. Recovery of attorneys’ fees by the prevailing party is limited to those individual actions or proceedings in which the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys’ fees. The award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party shall in no circumstances exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding. (Ord. 18-199 § 1)


1.04.064 Recovery of treble damages upon second or subsequent judgment finding property owner responsible for nuisance conditions.

Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two (2) year period finding that a property owner is responsible for a condition which may be abated as a nuisance, the court may order the property owner to pay treble (three (3) times) the cost of abatement. This section shall not apply to conditions abated pursuant to Section 17980 of the California Health and Safety Code. (Ord. 18-99 § 2)

Any action brought against the city on such a claim shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 945.6 and 946 of the Government Code.

C.    Pursuant to Chapter 5 of Part 3 of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code, written agreements entered into by or in behalf of the city may provide all claims arising out of or related to the agreement must be presented not later than the one hundredth (100th) day after the accrual of the cause of action, and such claims shall be governed by the provisions of this section.

Notice inviting bids shall include a legal description of the subject property, a vicinity map showing the general location of the subject property, the time and place of opening of bids, specifications for bids, and a statement that transfer of the surplus real property shall be by quitclaim deed.

B.    Sealed bids, including a ten percent (10%) bid deposit, shall be submitted to the City Clerk. Said bid deposit shall be in the form of cash, cashier’s check, certified check, or bidder’s bond executed by an authorized surety company.

C.    At the time and place fixed in the notice to bidders, all sealed proposals which have been received shall be publicly opened, examined and declared by the City Clerk. Of the proposals submitted which conform to all terms and conditions of sale, the proposal which is the highest shall be accepted unless a higher oral bid is accepted, or the City Manager rejects all bids.

D.    In his or her sole discretion, the City Manager may set a minimum acceptable bid amount and may reject any and all bids presented.

E.    After opening bids the City Clerk shall call for oral bids from those bidders tendering written proposals. If, upon the call for oral bidding, any responsible person offers to purchase the property, upon the terms and conditions specified and for a price exceeding by at least five percent (5%) of the highest written proposal, and thereafter by successively higher bids by at least five percent (5%) of the highest written proposal, then the responsible oral bid which is the highest shall be accepted. Final acceptance by the City Manager shall not be made, however, until the oral bid is reduced to writing and signed by the offerer and an additional cash deposit (in cash, cashier’s check or certified check) in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the bid over the offerer’s original bid is tendered. This reduction of the bid to writing with signature and cash deposit shall be completed within twenty-four (24) hours after determination of the highest bidder has been declared by the City Manager, or the offerer shall forfeit his bid deposit.

F.    Upon determination of the highest bidder pursuant to subsection E of this section, the City Manager shall obtain City Council approval for the final agreement of sale and authorization to execute a quitclaim deed on behalf of the city.

G.    The successful bidder shall pay the balance of the purchase price plus all incidental and ancillary costs within fourteen (14) days of City Council approval of the final agreement of sale, unless an extension is agreed to by the city. Failure to submit the balance and all such costs within fourteen (14) days (or as may be extended) shall result in forfeiture of the bidder’s deposit. Unless otherwise specified in the notice to bidders, sale of surplus property shall be made for cash, cashier’s check or certified check.

H.    All bidders’ deposits shall be retained until the quitclaim deed is recorded and shall then be returned, except as provided in subsection G of this section. (Ord. 7-07 § 1 (part): Ord. 3-93 § 1 (part))

A.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

B.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

C.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;

D.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 8 § 4, 1982)


3.04.050 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of the sales and use tax ordinance codified in this chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 8 § 5, 1982)


3.04.060 Sales tax.

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.04.020 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date. (Ord. 8 § 6, 1982)


3.04.070 Place of sale.

For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the state of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this City shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “State” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, The State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this ordinance; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that Code; the substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

B.    The storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property, the gross receipts from the sale of which have been subject to tax under a sales and use tax ordinance enacted in accordance with Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code by any city and county, or city in this state shall be exempt from the tax due under this chapter.

C.    There are exempted from the computation of the amount of the sales tax the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to operators of aircraft to be used or consumed principally outside the city in which the sale is directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons or property under the laws of this state, the United States, or any foreign government.

D.    In addition to the exemptions provided in Sections 6366 and 6366.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased by operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such operators directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons or property for hire or compensation under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of this state, the United States, or any foreign government is exempted from the use tax.

3.16.010 Title.

The chapter shall be known as “the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city of Dublin.” (Ord. 16-84 § 1)


3.16.020 Definitions.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

“Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

“Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

“Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this ordinance and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

“Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

“Tax Administrator” means the City Clerk of the city or such other official as may be appointed by the City Council.

“Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 16-84 § 2)


3.16.030 Tax imposed.

Pursuant to the authority of Section 7280 and 7281 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 16-84 § 3)


3.16.040 Exemptions.

A.    No tax shall be imposed upon:

1.    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;

2.    Any federal or state of California officer or employee when on official business;

3.    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

B.    No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 16-84 § 4)


3.16.050 Operator’s duties.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of tax charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 16-84 § 5)


3.16.060 Registration of hotel required.

Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from the Tax Administrator a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

1.    The name of the operator;

2.    The address of the hotel;

3.    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

4.    “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, or to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 16-84 § 6)


3.16.070 Reporting and remitting.

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms provided by the Tax Administrator, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if deemed necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this ordinance shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 16-84 § 7)


3.16.080 Penalties and interest.

A.    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B.    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.

C.    Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.

D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half (1/2) of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.    Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 16-84 § 8)


3.16.090 Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax by Tax Administrator.

If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as is possible to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at the operators last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.16.100. (Ord. 16-84 § 9)


3.16.100 Appeal procedure.

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at the operators last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 16-84 § 10)


3.16.110 Records required.

A.    It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as the operator may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

B.    All tax returns and information furnished by any operator pursuant to this chapter shall be confidential and shall not be open to public inspection nor the specific contents thereof disclosed by any officer or employee except as necessary in the performance of official duty pursuant to this chapter, or in the course of any proceedings, hearing or litigation involving the existence or amount of the tax liability of such operator, or with the written consent of the operator or his authorized representative. (Ord. 16-84 § 11)


3.16.120 Refunds.

A.    Whatever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

B.    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C.    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 16-84 § 12)


3.16.130 Actions to collect.

Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 16-84 § 13)


3.16.140 Violation—Penalty.

A.    Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) or by imprisonment in jail for a period of not more than six (6) months or by both such fine and imprisonment.

B.    Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Tax Administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

The city of Dublin, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct cable systems within the city limits. (Ord. 3-01 § 3.1)


3.20.020 Findings.

The City Council finds that the development of cable systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable systems, the City Council further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such persons as the city may designate. It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable service to the public and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this as an integral finding thereof. It is the further intent of this chapter to establish regulatory provisions that permit the city to regulate cable system franchises to the extent permitted by federal and state law, including but not limited to the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable Federal Communications Commission regulations and applicable California law.

Grantor adopts and incorporates by reference the FCC Cable Regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (47 U.S.C. 521 et seq.), including but not limited to those rules and regulations regarding rate regulation as set forth in 47 CFR 76.900 to 76.985 and regarding customer service standards as set forth in 47 CFR 76.309. Amendments to FCC rules and regulations implementing the Cable Act of 1992 made after the effective date of this section shall also be incorporated by reference without further legislative action by the Grantor.

The FCC Cable Regulations supersede any different or inconsistent provisions in Chapter 3.20 or in the franchise granted under it.

A copy of the FCC regulations is on file in the City Clerk’s office.

B.    Implementation. Grantor shall implement the FCC Cable Regulations in the city with the existing grantee and any future franchisees. In implementing the regulations, Grantor will ensure a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties. (Ord. 3-94 § 1. Formerly 3.20.335.)

Article II. Franchise Terms and Conditions


3.20.070 Franchise purposes.

A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall encompass the following purposes:

A.    To permit the Grantee to engage in the business of providing cable service, and such other services as may be permitted by law which Grantee provides to subscribers within the designated service area.

B.    To permit the Grantee to erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets or other public places within the designated service area.

D.    To set forth the obligations of the Grantee under the franchise. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.1)


3.20.080 Franchise required.

After June 1, 2001, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or operate a cable system in the city within any public way without a properly granted franchise awarded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.2)


3.20.090 Term of the franchise.

A.    A franchise granted hereunder shall be for a term established in the franchise agreement, commencing on the Grantor’s adoption of an ordinance or resolution authorizing the franchise.

B.    A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed upon application by the Grantee pursuant to the provisions of applicable state and federal law. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.3)


3.20.100 Franchise territory.

Any franchise shall be valid within all the municipal limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.4)


3.20.110 Federal or state jurisdiction.

This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after June 1, 2001, to the extent permitted by applicable law. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.5)


3.20.120 Franchise nontransferable.

A.    Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied, withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the prior consent of the Council shall not be required for an intracorporate or intracompany transfer from one wholly-owned subsidiary to another wholly-owned subsidiary. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the Council shall be null and void. The granting of a security interest in any Grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation or by assignment of any right, title or interest in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness, shall not be considered a transfer for the purposes of this section.

B.    The requirements of subsection A of this section shall apply to any change in control of Grantee. The word “control” as used herein includes majority ownership, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the event that Grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the Council shall be required where ownership or control of more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting stock of the Grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the Grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively.

C.    Grantee shall notify Grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the Grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be considered by Grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of Grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply.

D.    For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, Grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and Grantee shall assist Grantor in such inquiry. In seeking Grantor’s consent to any change of ownership or control, Grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the Grantee and/or the proposed transferee complete an application in accordance with Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or equivalent. Grantor may require Grantee to submit such additional information as the Grantor may reasonably require to determine that the proposed transferee possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications, or that Grantee is in compliance with all substantive franchise requirements. An application shall be submitted to Grantor not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer. If the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the applicant are determined by the Grantor to be satisfactory, and if Grantor determines that Grantee is in compliance with all substantive franchise requirements, the Grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise. If the Grantor has not taken action on the Grantee’s request for transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving FCC Form 394 or equivalent, Grantor’s consent to such transfer shall be deemed given. The consent of the Grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Grantor does not waive any lawful authority it may have to impose conditions on the transfer.

E.    Any financial institution having a pledge of the Grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the Grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the Grantor shall take control of and operate the cable system, in the event of a Grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also agree in writing to continue cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system.

F.    Upon transfer, Grantee shall reimburse Grantor for Grantor’s reasonable processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise, including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to Grantor during the term of the franchise. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.6)


3.20.130 Geographical coverage.

A.    Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable system to have the capability to pass every residential dwelling unit in the service area, subject to any service area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.

B.    After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, Grantee shall provide service to any requesting subscriber within that service area within thirty (30) days from the date of request; provided, that the Grantee is able to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty (30) day period on reasonable terms and conditions. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.7)


3.20.140 Nonexclusive franchise.

Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law; provided, that if the Grantor grants an additional franchise, then the material provisions of any such additional franchise shall be reasonably comparable to the terms and conditions contained in the initial Grantee’s franchise, so that all Grantees are accorded competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory treatment. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.8)


3.20.150 Multiple franchises.

A.    Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:

1.    The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.

2.    The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.

3.    The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way.

B.    Where electric and telephone utilities are to be placed underground in any new residential housing developments, Grantor and the developer of such new residential housing shall give each Grantee serving the franchise area within which the new residential housing development is located at least ten (10) working days’ prior written notice of the date on which open trenching will be available for the Grantee’s installation of conduit, pedestals and vaults. On request of the Grantor or developer, the Grantee shall provide specifications needed for trenching.

C.    Grantor may require that any new entrant, nonincumbent Grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in Grantor’s opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.9)


3.20.160 Franchise modification.

The Grantee may be required to pay any costs incurred by the Grantor in processing a Grantee request for franchise modification, lease, hypothecation or trust of franchise. Such costs may include the costs incurred for hiring consultants to assist in evaluating the request. Such costs shall be paid by the Grantee prior to final consideration of the request by the Grantor. (Ord. 3-01 § 6.10)

Grantee shall provide sufficient documentation to permit Grantor to verify Grantee’s compliance for the previous twenty-four (24) month period. Grantee may request, and Grantor shall not unreasonably deny, a request for a reasonable extension of time in which to produce such documentation.

B.    A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the consumer protection standards of Sections 3.20.210, 3.20.220 and 3.20.230, after Grantee’s receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement.

C.    In order to determine whether sufficient telephone lines are provided, the Grantor may require, upon thirty (30) calendar days’ written notice, the Grantee to submit a report verifying the adequacy of its telephone line capacity. If Grantee is unable to provide such a report, Grantor may require that a busy study, traffic study or other study be conducted, at Grantee’s expense, if any, by the local telephone company. Should Grantee have its own telephone equipment which can report on telephone line(s) usage, the Grantee may submit such report from its own system. The Grantor, pursuant to Section 3.20.210(C), may require Grantee to acquire equipment to determine compliance with the telephone answering standards of this article.

D.    Should the Grantor determine that insufficient telephone lines or inadequate staff exists, Grantee shall take necessary steps to ensure that adequate telephone lines and/or staffing are available to permit Grantee to satisfy its obligations under this chapter and the franchise. Consideration shall be given for periods of promotional activities or outages. The monthly billing period shall be considered as a normal, daily activity for purposes of determining the availability of adequate telephone lines and/or staffing. (Ord. 3-01 § 8.4)


3.20.250 Subscriber complaints and disputes.

A.    Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the Grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber’s grounds for dissatisfaction.

The written procedures shall include a requirement that Grantee respond to any written complaint from a subscriber within thirty (30) days of receipt.

B.    Upon prior written request, Grantor shall have the right to review Grantee’s response to any subscriber complaints in order to determine Grantee’s compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber’s right to privacy.

C.    Subject to applicable law, it shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving cable service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the Grantee are honored.

D.    In the event of a change of control of Grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original Grantee shall cooperate with the Grantor, new Grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, Grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system.

E.    Grantee response to subscriber complaints, as well as complaints made by subscribers to Grantor and provided by Grantor to Grantee, shall be initiated within one (1) business day of receipt by Grantee. The resolution of subscriber complaints shall be effected by Grantee not later than three (3) business days after receipt of the complaint.

If the Grantor should fulfill this obligation for the Grantee, then during such period as the Grantor fulfills such obligation, the Grantor shall be entitled to collect all revenues from the system, and the Grantee shall reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by Grantor that are the result of Grantee’s failure to perform.

B.    All officers, agents or employees of Grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers’ premises shall carry a photo-identification card. Grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of the Grantee or its major subcontractors shall be clearly identified as working for Grantee.

C.    Additional customer service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by Grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise; provided, that Grantee shall receive due process, including prior written notification and a reasonable opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed.

Article V. Franchise Fee and Financial Requirements


3.20.270 Franchise fee.

A.    Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor a franchise fee on gross annual cable service revenues in the amount and at the times set forth in the franchise agreement.

B.    In the event that any franchise fee payment or payment of any adjustment to any franchise fee is not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, Grantee shall pay:

1.    An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the highest of the most recently published prime lending rate of any of the five (5) largest member banks of the New York Clearing House Association, plus one percent (1%) during the period for which payment was due; and

C.    In the event Grantee overpays its franchise fee, the Grantee shall notify the Grantor in writing, and provide sufficient documentation to verify the alleged overpayment. Upon written authorization by the Grantor, said authorization not to be unreasonably withheld, the Grantee may begin deducting the amount overpaid beginning with the next franchise fee payment due from Grantee to Grantor, and Grantee may continue to deduct the amount paid on subsequent franchise fee payments until the amount overpaid is fully reimbursed to Grantee.

D.    The Grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within ninety (90) days of the close of the calendar year, either audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant or certified by an officer of the Grantee, reflecting the total amounts of gross annual cable service revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment.

E.    Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement.

F.    Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by the Grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the Grantee.

10.    Grantee shall be subject to any and all requirements established by the Grantor with regard to the location, either aboveground or underground, as well as screening of Grantee’s facilities and equipment located in the public rights-of-way.

Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part thereof, shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use.

B.    Grantor, upon such reasonable terms as Grantor may lawfully impose, may give Grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the Grantee shall remove all abandoned aboveground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from Grantor and shall restore to Grantor’s reasonable satisfaction any affected public right-of-way. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, Grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing immediately prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments. Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the public rights-of-way, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and the security fund as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by Grantee with the terms and conditions of this section.

C.    Upon the approved abandonment of any cable system property, the Grantee, if required by the Grantor, shall submit to the Grantor an instrument, satisfactory in form to the Grantor, transferring to the Grantor the ownership of the abandoned cable system property.

D.    At the expiration, without renewal or extension, of the term for which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation, as provided herein, the Grantor shall have the right to require Grantee to remove, at its own expense, all aboveground portions of the cable system from all streets and public ways within the service area within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty (180) days.

E.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the Grantee may abandon any underground cable system property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other franchise holder. (Ord. 3-01 § 17.1)


3.20.490 Restoration by Grantor—Reimbursement of costs.

Upon reasonable written notice and upon the failure of the Grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any public right-of-way required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Grantor, the Grantor may cause the work to be commenced and/or completed. The Grantor shall provide to the Grantee an itemized work order setting forth in detail the exact nature of the work completed and the supplies used in such work. The Grantee shall pay to the Grantor the reasonable costs for such work no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the itemized work order. (Ord. 3-01 § 17.2)


3.20.500 Extended operation and continuity of services.

Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the Grantor shall have the discretion to permit Grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time. Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the cable services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available cable services; provided, that financial and other obligations to Grantee are honored. The Grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. (Ord. 3-01 § 17.3)


3.20.510 Receivership and foreclosure.

A.    At the option of the Grantor and subject to applicable law, a franchise granted hereunder may be revoked one hundred twenty (120) days after appointment of a receiver(s) or trustee(s) to take over and conduct the business of Grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless:

1.    The receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated within said one hundred twenty (120) days; or

2.    Such receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the Grantor; or

3.    Such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, have executed an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise.

B.    In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the cable system, in whole or in part, the Grantor may serve notice of revocation upon Grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and privileges of the Grantee hereunder shall be revoked thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless:

1.    A bona fide transfer request has been submitted by Grantee for Grantor review; or

2.    Grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the manner provided by law; and

3.    The successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with Grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise. (Ord. 3-01 § 17.4)

Article XIII. Grantor and Subscriber Rights


3.20.520 Reservation of Grantor rights.

In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the Grantor by this chapter, the Grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise. (Ord. 3-01 § 18.1)


3.20.530 Waiver.

A.    The Grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the Grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the Grantee or on the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the Grantor. Waiver of any provision in one (1) instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites.

B.    The Grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement by any failure of the Grantor on any one or more occasions to require or seek compliance with any such terms or conditions. (Ord. 3-01 § 18.2)


3.20.540 Rights of individuals.

A.    Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age or sex. Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to nondiscrimination.

B.    Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state and local regulations, as now written or as amended from time to time.

C.    Unless directed or conducted by an authorized law enforcement agency, which has obtained all necessary permits, neither Grantee, nor any person, or entity shall, without the subscriber’s consent, tap, or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service, polling with audience participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be identified.

D.    In the conduct of providing its cable services or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, Grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber’s or general citizen’s right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The Grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system’s interactive two-way equipment or capability, if such equipment or capability exists, for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen.

E.    No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment owned by Grantee shall be installed by Grantee in the subscriber’s premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon subscriber’s properly shall be deemed granted.

F.    The Grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not sell, or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber pursuant to state and federal privacy laws:

1.    Any list of the names and addresses of subscribers containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; and

2.    Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit the Grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party. (Ord. 3-01 § 18.3)

3.32.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the “EMS Tax Ordinance” of the city of Dublin. (Ord. 6-97 § 1 (part))


3.32.020 Findings.

A.    The City Council of the city of Dublin does hereby determine that the cost to provide emergency medical services at a level required to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of its residents exceeds the amount of funds and revenues generated from all other sources of income available for such purpose. The City Council does further determine that the imposition of an emergency medical services tax on occupants of real property throughout the city as set forth below is necessary to maintain an adequate level of emergency medical services.

B.    The imposition of an emergency medical services tax will allow the city to provide a higher level of service than would otherwise be available to occupants of real property throughout the city.

Currently, the first unit to respond to a call for emergency medical services typically is a fire engine company or fire truck company staffed with personnel who have been trained as emergency medical technicians (“EMT’s”). The EMT’s can provide basic life support but cannot provide more advanced life support such as administering drugs or administering endotracheal intubation. The average response time is currently ten (10) minutes before an ambulance with a paramedic, who can provide advanced life support, arrives on the scene.

The emergency medical services tax will enable the city to train and provide sufficient fire personnel as firefighter/paramedics so that there will be a minimum of two firefighter/paramedic companies on duty twenty-four (24) hours a day. Firefighter/paramedics can provide advanced life support, including administration of drugs and endotracheal intubation, which EMT’s are not authorized to perform. By providing a minimum of two (2) firefighter/paramedics on duty twenty-four (24) hours a day the city will reduce the average response time from ten (10) minutes to five (5) minutes before ambulance personnel who can provide advanced life support arrive on the scene.

C.    The Council recognizes that occupants of different categories of property use differing amounts of emergency medical services. The tax rates established by this chapter are intended to be proportional to and based on estimates of typical use of and benefit from such services. The rates are not tailored to individual use within categories of property both because such tailoring is not administratively feasible and because the city must make Emergency Medical Services available to all occupants of property equally.

D.    The tax is based on a benefit unit with different land uses assigned a different number of benefit units. The weighted land use classification system was developed in 1983 by the Alameda County Emergency Medical Services District (EMS District) and the Alameda County Assessor. Under this classification system, benefit units were assigned to various land use types based on a county-wide survey of the demand for service generated by the land use. A single-family unit is one benefit unit. Because multiple family units in Dublin have lower occupant densities than single-family units (Dublin General Plan Table 2.1 [3.2 persons/unit single family; 2.0 persons/unit multiple family]), the city finds it is appropriate to modify the weighted classification system developed in 1983 by the EMS District and the Assessor. The tax on multiple family units is sixty (60%) percent of the tax on a single-family unit, which reflects the lower occupant densities of multiple family units. Nonresidential uses are assigned benefit units based on use ranging from two (2) to seven (7).

E.    Individual occupants typically do not choose whether or when to avail themselves of emergency medical services which are relied on in emergencies or unexpected circumstances. The value of such services is in their availability to all residents and it would be unfair to charge their costs only to those persons who actually use the services.

F.    Each occupant of property derives value from the availability of emergency medical services. Even if such services are not presently used by an occupant, they may be used in the future and, in any event, their availability benefits each occupant. Such services enhance the health, safety, welfare and environment of all occupants of property in Dublin and improve their quality of life both directly and indirectly.

G.    Parcels which are unimproved contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services. Accordingly, the Council has determined that owners of unimproved parcels are not subject to the tax.

H.    Parcels which are improved but vacant contain no occupants who may avail themselves of emergency medical services. Accordingly, the Council has determined that owners of vacant improved parcels may receive a refund of the tax if they can prove that the parcel was vacant for more than six (6) months.

I.    Approximately sixty-nine percent (69%) of Dublin’s residential units are owner-occupied and approximately sixty-six percent (66%) of all parcels are occupied by the property owner. Because these percentages are so high, the overall tax impact is not significantly different if the tax is imposed on occupants as opposed to owners. However, nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude owners from recovering the tax from the occupant. Whether the occupant is charged depends solely on the occupancy agreement. Moreover, nonpayment will not be a lien on the property but a personal obligation of the occupant or owner.

J.    It is not feasible for Dublin to collect the tax from the non-owner occupants on whom it is imposed because the records available to the city do not include the names of non-owner occupants. Therefore, the only practical way to collect a tax imposed on occupants is to collect it from the owners of the occupied properties.

K.    The tax imposed by this chapter is a tax on the privilege of using and the use of emergency medical services. It is not a tax on real property, nor is it any other kind of tax on property or the ownership of property. It is not a transaction or sales tax on the sale of real property. Finally, because the tax proceeds are deposited in a special fund and the fund is restricted for emergency medical services, the tax is a special tax. (Ord. 6-97 § 1 (part))


3.32.030 Definitions.

As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

“Emergency medical services” shall mean and include salaries (including benefits), equipment and training required to provide basic and advanced life support to persons suffering medical emergencies.

“Occupant” shall mean the person or persons who rent, lease, reside in or otherwise occupy the real property to which emergency medical services are available.

“Owner” shall mean the owner or owners of the real property to which emergency medical services are available as shown on Alameda County’s most recent assessment roll.

“Year” shall mean the period from July 1st to the following June 30th. (Ord. 6-97 § 1 (part))


3.32.040 Tax imposed.

An annual Emergency Medical Services Tax (“tax”) in the amounts set forth in Section 3.32.050 is hereby imposed on occupant of real property within the boundaries of the city of Dublin.

The tax is an excise tax imposed on the occupant as of July 1st of each year; provided, however that if any building or structure on any parcel is unoccupied on that date, the tax is imposed on the first occupant occupying the building or structure during the year.

Notwithstanding the tax liability of the occupant, the owner of each parcel giving rise to tax liability under this chapter shall be responsible for the collection and/or remittance of the tax due and payable hereunder.

A.    It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer in the city of Dublin without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter for each location at which that activity is to occur. Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailer’s license is a nuisance as a matter of law. 

B.    Display of License. Each tobacco retailer license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed location.

C.    Positive Identification Required. No person engaged in tobacco retailing shall sell or transfer a tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia to another person who appears to be under the age of twenty-seven (27) years without first examining the identification of the recipient to confirm that the recipient is at least the minimum age under state law to purchase and possess the tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia.

D.    False and Misleading Advertising Prohibited. A tobacco retailer or proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer license, including, for example, a person whose license has been revoked:

1.    Shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia out of public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing without a license under Section 4.40.100; and

2.    Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer’s location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at that location.

E.    License may be issued only to a business that will engage in tobacco retail activities at a fixed location.

F.    License Conveys a Limited, Conditional Privilege. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, but not limited to, any provision of this code, including without limitation the zoning ordinance, building codes, and business license tax ordinance, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code Section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer license does not make the retailer a “retail or wholesale tobacco shop” for the purposes of California Labor Code Section 6404.5.

G.    Fee for License. The fee for the issuance and renewal of a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established from time to time by resolution of the City Council, and shall be due and payable at the time a license application is submitted to the city. The fee shall be calculated so as to include, but not exceed, the cost of administration and enforcement of this chapter, including the administration of the license program, retailer inspection and compliance checks.

1.    In any year where grant funding has been obtained to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this chapter, or a portion thereof, the amount of the license fee charged for the twelve (12) months following receipt of the grant funding shall be reduced based on the amount of grant funding received and on the total number of tobacco retailers operating in the city.

B.    It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a license as a determination by the city that the proprietor has complied with all laws applicable to tobacco retailing. A license issued contrary to this chapter, contrary to any other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 4.40.090(E). Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to vest in any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right to act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.

C.    All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the Chief of Police and shall contain the following information:

1.    The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the business seeking a license.

4.    Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer’s license by the California Board of Equalization.

5.    Whether or not any proprietor or any agent of the proprietor has admitted violating, or has been found to have violated, this chapter and, if so, the dates and locations of all such violations within the previous five (5) years.

4.40.050 Issuance of license.

A.    Upon the receipt of a complete application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the application fee required by this chapter, the Chief of Police shall issue a license unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one (1) or more of the following bases for denial exists:

1.    The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this chapter.

2.    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location where tobacco retailing is prohibited pursuant to Chapter 8.43.

3.    The application seeks a license for the conduct of sales at a location that, at the time the application is submitted, is ineligible for a new permit pursuant to Section 4.40.090(F).

1.    Submit the license fee and application renewal form; and

2.    Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor either:

a.    Has not sold and will not sell any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia after the license expiration date and before the license is renewed; or 

b.    Has waited the appropriate ineligibility period established for tobacco retailing without a license, as set forth in Section 4.40.100(A), before seeking renewal of the license. (Ord. 20-12 § 10 (part))


4.40.070 Licenses nontransferable.

A tobacco retailer’s license may not be transferred from one (1) person to another or from one (1) location to another. A new tobacco retailer’s license is required whenever a tobacco retailing location has a change in proprietor(s). (Ord. 20-12 § 10 (part))


4.40.080 Compliance monitoring.

A.    Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the Chief of Police. In addition, any peace officer may enforce the penal provisions of this chapter. The city may designate any number of additional persons to monitor compliance with this chapter.

B.    The city shall not enforce any law establishing a minimum age for tobacco purchases or possession against a person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of the person’s age (hereinafter “youth decoy”) if the potential violation occurs when:

1.    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a code enforcement official of the city; 

2.    The youth decoy is acting as an agent of a person designated by the city to monitor compliance with this chapter; or

3.    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part, either directly or indirectly through subcontracting, by the Alameda County Public Health Department or the California Department of Health Services. (Ord. 20-12 § 10 (part))


4.40.090 Denial or revocation of license.

A.    Revocation of License. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law or this chapter, a tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if any court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the Chief of Police finds based on a preponderance of the evidence, after the licensee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the licensee, or any of the licensee’s agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements, conditions, or prohibitions of this chapter or has pleaded guilty, “no contest” or its equivalent, or violated any law designated in Section 4.40.030.

1.    In such hearings, investigations, and inquiries by the Hearing Officer, he or she shall not be bound in the conduct thereof by the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure but inquiry shall be made in the manner, through oral testimony and records, which is best calculated to ascertain the substantial rights of the public parties and carry out justly the spirit and provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 6-06 § 1 (part))


5.04.050 Violation—Penalty.

A.    Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.

5.32.020 Findings.

The management of solid waste is a matter of great importance to the city, and its citizens, visitors, property owners and businesses. The city has found that the public health, safety, and well-being require that the generation, accumulation, handling, collection, transportation, conversion and disposal of solid waste be controlled and regulated by the city through the comprehensive system provided in this chapter. The establishment and maintenance of this system will benefit the city and all its citizens, visitors, property owners and businesses apart from and in addition to individual use. The system seeks to maintain a readily available solid waste disposal service which the city wants to be reliable, clean, efficient and economical. The system will help to reduce the harboring and breeding of rodents and insects, to reduce the spread of disease, and to prevent pollution and other unsightly degradation of the environment. The comprehensive solid waste management system provided in this chapter is found to be in the public interest. (Ord. 2-86 § 2 (5-101))

This chapter shall be known as “the smoking pollution control ordinance.” (Ord. 2-94 § 1 (part): Ord. 13-86 § 1000)


5.56.020 Findings and purpose.

A.    The city council finds that:

1.    Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; and

2.    Reliable studies have shown that breathing secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for certain population groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and

3.    Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm; and

4.    Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same; and

5.    Numerous studies have shown that a majority of both nonsmokers and smokers desire to have restrictions on smoking in public places, places of employment, and multi-unit housing; and

6.    Smoking is the number one cause of preventable home fire deaths across the nation; and 

7.    Cigarette butts pose a health threat to young children when ingested, which may result in vomiting, lethargy, nausea, and gagging; and

8.    Cigarette butts are a major and persistent source of litter; and

9.    Nearly eighty-seven percent (87%) of Californians do not smoke; and

10.    A local ordinance that authorizes residential rental agreements to include a prohibition on smoking of tobacco products within rental units is not prohibited by state law.

B.    Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are:

1.    To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places, except in designated smoking areas, and by regulating smoking in places of employment; and

2.    To strike a reasonable balance between the needs of smokers and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that, where these needs conflict, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority; and

3.    To provide for the public health, safety, and welfare by discouraging the inherently dangerous behavior of smoking around non-tobacco users; by protecting children from exposure to smoking where they live and play; and by protecting the public from nonconsensual exposure to secondhand smoke in and around their homes.

Chapter 5.61 GREEN BUILDING PRACTICES FOR CITY PROJECTS

Sections:

5.61.010    Findings.

5.61.020    Definitions.

5.61.030    Mandatory green building practices.

5.61.040    Standards for compliance.

5.61.050    Unusual circumstances.


5.61.010 Findings.

The City Council of the city of Dublin hereby finds and declares that:

A.    The design, construction, maintenance, and demolition of buildings and structures within the city can have a significant impact on the city’s environmental sustainability, resource usage and efficiency, waste management, and the health and productivity of residents, workers, and visitors.

B.    “Green” building design, construction, and operation can have a significant positive effect on energy and resource efficiency, waste and pollution generation, and the health and productivity of a building’s occupants over the life of the building.

C.    Green building benefits are spread throughout the systems and features of the building. Building “green” can include, among other things, the use of certified sustainable wood products; aggressive use of high recycled content products; recycling of waste that occurs during deconstruction, demolition, and construction; enhancement of indoor air quality by selection and use of construction materials that do not have chemical emissions that are toxic or irritating to building occupants; modification of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems to provide energy efficiency and improved indoor air; use of water conserving methods and equipment; and installation of alternative energy methods for supplemental energy production.

D.    The U.S. Green Building Council, developer of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™) Commercial Green Building Rating System and LEED™ Reference Guide, has become a leader in promoting and guiding green building.

E.    Requiring certain city projects to incorporate LEED™ green building measures is necessary and appropriate to achieve the benefits of green building.

F.    Green design, construction, and operation decisions made by the city in the construction and remodeling of city buildings result in environmental benefits and cost savings to the city over the life of the buildings. By calling on the city to include green building measures in its own facilities, the City Council provides taxpayers a benefit through environmentally friendly, cheaper to operate buildings and simultaneously helps to develop markets for recycled, recyclable, and environmentally sound materials.

G.    It is critical to both the economic and environmental health of the city that the city provides leadership to both the private and public sectors in the arena of energy efficiency and “green” construction. The most immediate and meaningful way to do this is to include energy efficiency and green building elements in as many public buildings as feasible.

H.    It is in the public interest to address the appropriateness of mandating green building requirements for private projects separately from, and subsequent to, applying such requirements to city projects. Accordingly, unless and until the City Council determines otherwise, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to private sector development. (Ord. 9-04 § 1)


5.61.020 Definitions.

A.    “Green building practices” means a whole-systems approach to the design, construction, and operation of buildings and structures that helps mitigate the environmental, economic, and social impacts of construction, demolition, and renovation.

C.    “Structure” means that which is built or constructed, an edifice or building of any kind or any piece of work artificially built or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner and permanently attached to the ground.

D.    “City project” or “project” means new construction or renovation primarily funded or sponsored by the city, conducted on city-owned property, or managed by city personnel from design through construction. “City project” or “project” shall also include any buildings constructed for the city’s use under a build-to-suit program or project.

G.    “Initiated” means officially identified and fully funded to offset all the costs associated with the project as found in the city capital improvement plan.

H.    “Conditioned space” means an enclosed space in a building that is provided with a mechanical heating/cooling system as defined in the Dublin building code.

I.    “Estimated cost of construction” means the total projected cost of completing a proposed project, including fees, design, construction and land.

E.    In determining whether the request for waiver because of undue hardship will be granted, and subsequent assistance provided to the property owner to remove graffiti, the city shall consider the following circumstances:

Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state.

In one (1) or more subsequent phase(s), remaining publication dispensing devices in the city will be replaced with newsracks.

C.    The design, dimensions, location, materials and orientation of each newsrack shall be determined by the Director and shall be based on sound traffic engineering principles, pedestrian safety factors, traffic safety factors, and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

D.    Upon notice from the city that a newsrack will replace a publication dispensing device, the owner will have thirty (30) days to remove, at the publisher’s cost, the publication dispensing device. After thirty (30) days, the city will have the right to remove the publication dispensing device and bill the owner for the costs of removal and disposal. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))


5.104.040 Newsrack space permits.

A.    Publishers using newsrack spaces shall first have obtained a newsrack space permit permitting such use. Any publisher desiring the use of a newsrack space in a newsrack for purposes of dispensing a publication shall submit an application for a newsrack space permit to the Director. Publishers must submit one (1) application for each publication. Only those publishers submitting completed applications shall be eligible to obtain a newsrack space permit.

The Director shall determine the form of, and provide to interested persons copies of, the newsrack space permit application form.

B.    The application for a newsrack space permit shall be submitted by the publisher and shall include the following:

1.    The name, mailing address, telephone number and/or cellular telephone number, and, if any, the facsimile number and/or e-mail address of both the owner of the publication and the applicant and the names under which the owner and applicant conduct business, if any.

2.    The name, mailing address, telephone number and/or cellular telephone number, and, if any, the facsimile number and/or e-mail address of the individual person or persons who will have supervision of and responsibility for the use and maintenance of the newsrack space.

3.    The relationship between the owner of the publication and the applicant and a statement of the applicant’s authority to make the application on behalf of the owner of the publication.

4.    The name of the publication for which the space is desired, a statement verifying that the publication exists as of the date of the application, and a copy of the publication for which the permit is desired.

5.    Proof of liability insurance, for the term of the permit, with minimum policy limits for personal injury or death and for property damage as is determined appropriate by the Director based on the risk experience under this chapter, naming the city as an additional named insured in the event of personal injury or death or property damage caused by any negligence of the permittee in the maintenance of any newsrack space. For purposes of this subsection, “negligence” also includes reckless, knowing or intentional conduct.

6.    Whether a coin-operated mechanism is desired.

7.    Such other information as is requested on the form.

C.    There shall be a permit fee, set by resolution, for each newsrack space allocated for a publication. 

1.    No refund of fees shall be made if the publication abandons or surrenders a space.

2.    All fees shall be paid before issuance of the permit. When one (1) applicant has submitted applications on behalf of a number of publications, the applicant shall pay the permit fees for all spaces and for all of the publications before a permit may be issued for any of the publications.

3.    A permit shall not be issued to an applicant, or for a publication, which fails to pay the applicable permit fee for all spaces allocated to the applicant for the publication. Failure to pay the permit fee will result in the newsrack space being deemed unallocated and available to be allocated to another publisher.

D.    The requirement that a copy of the publication be submitted with the application is intended to ensure only that the publication exists at the time of the application; the Director may not deny a permit for any publication based upon its content. No permit shall be issued for a publication that does not exist at the time of the application.

E.    The Director shall maintain a record of all newsrack spaces that have been allocated or reallocated, the permittees to which the spaces have been allocated or reallocated, and the publication permitted to be dispensed from the spaces.

F.    Each newsrack space permit will allow the distribution of one publication in a specific newsrack location.

G.    Permits are not transferable. 

H.    Permits issued under this section shall expire on December 31st of each odd-numbered year. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))

A.    When the city replaces the publication dispensing devices on Dublin Boulevard with newsracks, the Director will make one (1) newsrack space available for each publication a publisher is distributing from a publication dispensing device on Dublin Boulevard as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, as long as that publisher submits a completed application within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and complies with all the provisions of this chapter. The newsrack space provided will be in the same general location as the current publication. 

B.    When publication dispensing devices are replaced in other parts of the city, the Director will make one (1) newsrack space available for each publication a publisher is distributing from a publication dispensing device as of the date the city purchases the newsracks. The newsrack space provided will be in the same general location as the current publication.

C.    The city will consider requests for additional newsracks in locations where all the existing spaces are full and one (1) or more publishers wishes to distribute publications in that location.

D.    If, for ADA compliance, safety, aesthetic or financial reasons, the city cannot continue to install additional newsracks to accommodate all publishers wishing to distribute publications in a single location, and no publisher is willing to move to a different location where newsrack space is available, then the city shall implement a first-come, first-served system. Additional rules and procedures related to implementing the system may be adopted pursuant to Section 5.104.180. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))

B.    When the Director makes an initial determination that a newsrack space has been abandoned or surrendered, the affected permittee shall be notified of the Director’s initial determination in accordance with Section 5.104.140(C). 

C.    The permittee shall have an opportunity to contest the initial determination by filing a request for a hearing in accordance with the procedures described in Section 5.104.150.

D.    Upon a final determination that the newsrack space is abandoned, any permit purporting to be a permit for the space or spaces finally determined to be surrendered or abandoned shall be void as to the space or spaces so determined, and the holder of the voided permit shall no longer be deemed a permittee as to the space or spaces so determined.

E.    A permittee may surrender a newsrack space prior to expiration of the permit for the space when the permittee no longer wishes to dispense the publication through the space.

F.    Any person desiring to use a newsrack space that is unallocated, or that has become available through abandonment or surrender, may apply for the reallocation of such newsrack spaces.

G.    The Director shall maintain a record of unallocated, abandoned and surrendered spaces. Unallocated, abandoned or surrendered spaces shall be reallocated by a first-come, first-served system.

H.    No person, including the person to whom a newsrack space has been allocated or reallocated, may place any publication in the space if the space has been finally determined to have been abandoned or surrendered, until such time as the space has been reallocated, after which the permittee under the reallocation may insert its publication in the space. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))


5.104.070 Abandonment of publication dispensing devices.

Publication dispensing devices remaining empty for sixty (60) days or not claimed within thirty (30) days of seizure shall be deemed abandoned.

B.    It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to maintain any newsrack space, and any coin-operated mechanism, for which it holds a permit, in good working order. Any cost to maintain the space or the coin-operated mechanism shall be borne by the permittee. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))


5.104.090 Maintenance of publication dispensing devices. 

Publication dispensing devices already existing as of December 1, 2009, may be entirely removed, but may not be moved or modified and shall continue to be maintained in a neat and clean condition until they are replaced by a city-owned newsrack. (Ord. 2-10 § 3 (part))


5.104.100 Temporary dislocations.

A.    The Director may direct a permittee to temporarily remove copies of the permitted publication from a newsrack during any public, private or utility construction work, conducted on the public sidewalk, the abutting roadway, an adjacent building or structure or to any utility, when the Director determines that the removal is necessary to facilitate such work.

B.    The Director may direct a permittee to remove copies of the permitted publication from a newsrack during any installation or repair work on the newsrack.

In order to implement the goals and objectives of the city of Dublin’s (“city”) general plan and the Eastern Dublin specific plan and to mitigate the impacts caused by future development in the city, certain noise mitigation measures must be implemented. The City Council has determined that a noise mitigation fee is needed in order to implement these noise mitigation measures and to pay for each development’s fair share of the implementation costs of the necessary noise mitigation measures.

5.112.040 Developer construction of facilities.

If a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a permit, to construct an improvement that has been designated to be financed with noise mitigation fees and if the improvement has a value in excess of that needed to mitigate the impacts of the development, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and a credit against the fee otherwise levied by this chapter on the development project shall be offered by the city. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the improvement needed to mitigate the burdens created by the development. (Ord. 1-95 § 1 (part))

Such taxi services are a business that is required to be licensed under this chapter. Taxi services which have picked up passengers outside of the city and delivered the passengers to a location within the city are excluded from the licensing requirements under this chapter. “Exclusive ride” as it is referred to in this section does not preclude a passenger from directing the taxicab driver to pick up additional passengers en route to a destination and incurring the additional metered time and/or distance that would be required.

“Division of Measurement Standards” means the state agency charged with and responsible for ensuring the accuracy of commercial weighing and measuring devices.

“Driver” means every person in direct and immediate possession of, in charge of, or operating a taxicab.

“Owner” means every person, firm, partnership, association or corporation having proprietary use, ownership or control of any taxicab or fleet of taxicabs.

“Prearranged trip” means a trip using an online enabled application, dispatch, or internet website. A company may provide prearranged trips anywhere within the county in which it has obtained a permit.

“Sole proprietor” means an independent, self-employed driver whose business is substantially located in the city and who obtains a permit from the city without employing additional drivers.

“Substantially located” means either the jurisdiction where a company maintains its primary business address, or the jurisdiction where the largest share of prearranged and nonprearranged trips originates, as defined in Government Code Section 53075.5. “Substantially located” shall also mean, for companies establishing a new operation after January 1, 2019, the jurisdiction where a company has its primary business address for the first twelve (12) months of operation. A company or driver may be substantially located in more than one (1) jurisdiction.

“Taxicab” means and includes all motor vehicles engaged in the business of transporting passengers for hire on the streets of the city, irrespective of whether such operations extend beyond the boundary limits of the city; such vehicles being designed for carrying not more than eight (8) persons, excluding the driver; and not operating on regular schedules and over regularly established routes. Specifically excluded from the definition of “taxicab” are vans or other vehicles providing transportation for the handicapped, operated by nonprofit social service organizations.

“Taximeter” means a device attached to or utilized by a taxicab, by means of which device the authorized charge for hire of such vehicle is mechanically calculated on the basis of distance traveled, or for waiting time, or a combination of both, which charges shall be indicated by means of figures in dollars and cents.

The minimum liability limits upon each such vehicle shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit for bodily injury to or death of any persons and for damages to or destruction of property in any one (1) accident. Such policy of insurance shall contain an endorsement providing that the policy shall not be canceled or materially modified until notice in writing has been given to the city, addressed to the Chief of Police, at least thirty (30) days immediately prior to the time such cancellation becomes effective. Further, such policy of insurance shall name the city, its officers, agents and employees as additional insured by separate endorsement. Any deviations from these requirements must be approved in writing by the city. Additionally, a vehicle owner and driver shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, its officers, agents and employees from claims arising from or alleged to arise from the negligence of the vehicle owner or driver. (Ord. 8-19 § 1 (part))


6.76.030 Taximeter requirements.

It is unlawful for any owner or driver to operate any taxicab in the city unless and until such vehicle is equipped with a taximeter.

6.84.040    Retrofitting.

6.84.050    Revocation of route.

6.84.060    Appeal process.


6.84.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for terminal designation and truck route designation to terminals for interstate trucks operating on a federally designated highway system and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 5-88 § 1)


6.84.020 Application—Procedure.

A.    Any interested person requiring terminal access from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form as provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the Director of Public Works and appropriate fees to the city.

B.    Upon receipt of the application, the Director of Public Works will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections, and highways and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed, and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans.

C.    Should the requested route pass through the city to a terminal located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that jurisdiction’s application process. Coordination of the approval of the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal’s land use. (Ord. 5-88 § 2)


6.84.030 Application—Fees and costs.

A.    The applicant shall pay a nonrefundable application fee, as established by the city by resolution, sufficient to pay the cost of the review of the terminal designation and the review of the route and alternate route.

B.    Upon the approval of the terminal designation and route by the city and by Caltrans, the applicant shall deposit with the city sufficient funds as estimated by the Director of Public Works to pay for the purchase and installation of terminal trailblazer signs. Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city or route to the terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. (Ord. 5-88 § 3)


6.84.040 Retrofitting.

A.    If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found unsatisfactory by the Director of Public Works, the applicant may request retrofitting the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction, and inspection will be the responsibility of the applicant. Except when the retrofitting of deficiencies is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans the actual construction will be done by the city or by applicant’s contractor under permit from the city.

B.    When the work is to be done by the City, the applicant shall deposit with the city the estimated cost of retrofitting. Adjustments between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. When the work is done by the applicant, the applicant may file with the Director of Public Works a statement detailing the actual costs of the retrofitting.

C.    If, at any time within five (5) years of the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any additional applicant seek terminal approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicant’s fee may include that applicant’s proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the Director of Public Works, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing herein shall require the payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the cost report with the Director of Public Works required above. (Ord. 5-88 § 4)


6.84.050 Revocation of route.

The Director of Public Works may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or said vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. (Ord. 5-88 § 5)


6.84.060 Appeal process.

A.    If the Director of Public Works denies terminal designation, route feasibility, or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the applicant/terminal owner, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of the decision of the Director of Public Works may appeal said decision to the City Council in writing. An appeal shall be made in a form prescribed by the Director of Public Works and shall be filed with the City Clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Director of Public Works or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within ten (10) days of the filing of an appeal, the Director of Public Works shall transmit to the City Clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route, and all other data filed therewith, the report of the Director of Public Works, the findings of the Director of Public Works, and his decision on the application.

B.    The City Clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the Director of Public Works available to the applicant and to the appellant, if the applicant is not the appellant, for inspection and may give notice to any other interested party who requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered by the City Council.

C.    If Caltrans and not the Director of Public Works denies or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may be made to the City Council, but must be made to Caltrans as may be permitted by Caltrans. (Ord. 5-88 § 6)

(Ord. 10-17 § 1 (part): Ord. 15-89 § 37: Ord. 13 § 1 (part), 1982)


7.04.420 Repair of sidewalks.

A.    Definitions. 

1.    “Maintenance and repair of sidewalk area” includes, but is not limited to, maintenance and repair of surfaces including grinding; removal and replacement of sidewalks; repair and maintenance of sidewalks; repair and maintenance of curbs and gutters; removal of impervious paving materials from street tree planting strips, or other right-of-way landscape planters; removal of weeds and/or debris; tree root pruning and installing root barriers; trimming of shrubs and/or groundcover and trimming shrubs within the area between the property line of the adjacent property and the street pavement line, including planting strips and curbs. 

2.    “Sidewalk” shall have the same meaning as in Section 5600 of the California Streets and Highways Code, as it may hereafter be amended.

B.    Maintenance and Repair of Sidewalks.

1.    Obligation to Repair and Maintain. The owners of lots or portions of lots adjacent to or fronting on any portion of a sidewalk area between the property line of the lots and the street line, including landscape planting strips, sidewalks, retaining walls, curbs and gutters, and persons in possession of such lots by virtue of any permit or right, shall repair and maintain such sidewalk areas in a condition that is not dangerous to property or to persons using the sidewalk in a reasonable manner and will not interfere with the public convenience of said sidewalk area. The owners shall also pay the costs and expenses therefor. All work performed within the public right-of-way requires an encroachment permit pursuant to Section 7.04.390.

When, during the course of a development project’s lifetime, it is necessary to remove or reconstruct public street improvements (i.e., curb, gutter, sidewalk), such improvements shall be reconstructed to preserve or reestablish any previously existing landscape planter, when certain landscape improvements have been included in the planned development (PD) properties subject to PD restrictions shall preserve existing street trees and other landscaping to the extent possible, or shall install new landscaping subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer.

Subsequent to adoption of the ordinance codified in this article, any unauthorized work conducted within the public right-of-way landscape areas shall be brought into conformance with the intent and provisions of this article, and other applicable provisions of the Dublin Municipal Code pertaining to encroachments on city property. Such unauthorized work shall constitute a violation of this article and is punishable as an infraction. 

C.    Recovery of City’s Costs of Sidewalk Maintenance and Repair. Anything in this article to the contrary notwithstanding, with respect to maintenance and repair of sidewalk areas and the making, confirming and collecting of assessment for the costs and expenses of said maintenance and repair, the city may proceed under the provisions of Chapter 22 of Division 7, Part 3 of the Streets and Highways Code of the state as the same is now in effect or may hereinafter be amended to recover costs it incurs in maintaining and repairing sidewalks. The required maintenance and repairs of sidewalk area must commence within thirty (30) days of notification. Costs recoverable by the city may include a charge for the city’s costs of inspection and administration whenever the city awards a contract for such maintenance and repair and including the costs of collection of assessment for the costs of maintenance and repair or the handling of any lien placed on the property due to the failure of the property owner to promptly pay such assessments.

While maintenance and repair costs ultimately remain the property owner’s responsibility, a portion of the city’s annual budget is allocated for sidewalk repair and the city may choose to permanently repair certain sidewalks with such money.

D.    Liability for Injuries to Public. The property owners of lots or portions of lots fronting on or adjacent to any portion of a street or any portion of a sidewalk area between the property line of the lots and the street line, and any persons in possession of such lots by virtue of any permit or right shall owe a duty to members of the public to keep and maintain the sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition. The failure of any property owner or possessor of property to maintain the sidewalk areas in a nondangerous condition is negligence. If any person suffers injury or damage to person or property as a result of the property owner’s or possessor’s failure to maintain or repair the sidewalk areas as required by this article, the property owner or possessor of property shall be liable to such person for the resulting damages or injury.

E.    Notice of Repair. Whenever a portion of the sidewalk needs repair or endangers the public’s use of such sidewalk, the person whose job it is to maintain streets shall notify the owner and person in possession that such sidewalk needs repair in the manner provided in Health and Safety Code Sections 5611 through 5614. If the owner does not fix the sidewalk within thirty (30) days, the city will fix the property and all costs may become a lien upon the property, pursuant to Section 7.04.500.

A.    No person shall construct, install, modify, or maintain a personal wireless service facility within, upon, over, or under the limits of any street in the city without first obtaining a personal wireless service facility permit as required in Article II of this chapter, and Chapter 8.92 as it relates to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012.

B.    In addition to the requirements of Section 7.04.190, a personal wireless service facility permit shall not be issued if the applicant seeks to:

1.    Install a new utility, transit, or street light pole on a street where there presently are no overhead utility facilities, other than street lights, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that utilization of an existing street light pole is not technically feasible for the applicant’s coverage objective;

2.    Install a personal wireless service facility that fails to comply with applicable building, structural, electrical, or safety codes or other laws, including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act; or

3.    Add a personal wireless service facility on a city-owned street light pole or other traffic control and safety pole for which the city has not given its permission. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (part))

A.    Installations must use all design techniques to minimize visual impacts, as determined by the City Engineer.

B.    New or replacement poles supporting a personal wireless service facility shall match style, color and material of the original or adjacent poles.

C.    The maximum height of a pole supporting a personal wireless service facility shall be equal to the average height of all existing utility or street light poles within one hundred (100) feet; provided, however, that an antenna located within a shroud on top of the pole may extend the height of the pole by a maximum of five (5) feet, or up to twelve (12) feet on a joint pole as may be necessary to comply with the clearance requirements established by California Public Utilities Commission General Order 95 or other applicable law or regulation. The height of any street light or utility pole shall not be modified unless approved by the City Engineer.

D.    No exposed cables. All cables shall be concealed within a sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket. For wooden poles, cables shall be concealed with the use of shrouds, risers or conduit.

E.    Minimum height clearance regulations shall be observed by all components of the installation. 

F.    No signs, other than those required by government or electrical utility notifications shall be located on the poles. All signage shall be designed with the lowest visibility, utilize a muted color and located as close to the antenna as possible. This does not pertain to identification badges, as may be required by the City Engineer. No facility may include any advertising material.

G.    The facility, including the antennas, cabling and related equipment shall be constructed out of nonreflective materials, painted and/or textured to match the existing support structure, and shall not produce any noticeable artificial light.

H.    The facility must be located so that it does not block the required illumination provided by the street light.

I.    Above ground cabinets are discouraged. The City Engineer shall not approve an above ground cabinet to serve a personal wireless service facility unless the applicant demonstrates that placement underground or pole mounting of equipment is not technically feasible or that the undergrounding or pole mounting will have more significant impacts on the public than the above ground cabinet. Where technically feasible, equipment shall be placed underground, unless it would have more significant impacts on the public than pole-mounted equipment. Above ground cabinets shall be designed and located in an area with minimal visual impact, as determined by the City Engineer. Pole-mounted equipment is subject to the following:

1.    Equipment shall be mounted in a manner to reduce its visibility and not obstruct the visibility of any road signs.

2.    Equipment cabinets may not exceed seven (7) cubic feet in volume.

3.    All equipment shall be limited to a maximum noise level of forty-five (45) dB measured at the nearest property line.

J.    All disturbed landscape shall be replaced in-kind and areas of bare or disturbed soil shall be vegetated or landscaped to prevent erosion to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.

K.    All new installations shall utilize brackets that allow antennas and associated facilities to be mounted at a standoff of no more than four (4) inches measured horizontally from the pole, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that a greater distance is required for clearance purposes. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (part))


7.04.450 Public notification.

A.    Notice Required. Prior to commencement of installation of a personal wireless service facility, the permittee shall notify the public of the proposed installation as specified in this section.

The Alameda County property numbering system adopted by Alameda County Ordinance No. 288 N.S. is adopted as the grid system for assigning addresses. A map of the grid system is available for public inspection in the office of the city clerk. (Ord. 4-87 § 2)


7.08.020 Assignment of numbers.

The grid system shall be the basis for assigning numbers. However, minor deviations from the grid system may be made in order that lots within a given block may be in the same hundred block. Where streets change direction numbers may be assigned in a manner that is consistent with public convenience. Where streets form circles the lots may be numbered consecutively around the circle. (Ord. 4-87 § 3)


7.08.030 Names of streets.

The following guideline shall be used in naming streets:

A.    All streets, roads and ways running generally northerly and southerly to be know as “streets” or “roads.”

B.    All streets, roads and ways running generally easterly and westerly shall be known as “avenues” or “ways.”

C.    All streets, roads and ways running in a variable curving or winding direction shall be known as “drives” or “lanes.”

D.    All cul-de-sac or dead ends not a continuation of any of the above shall be known as “courts” or “places.”

E.    Major arterial routes through the city shall be known as “boulevards,” “parkways,” “freeways,” or “throughways.” (Ord. 4-87 § 4)


7.08.040 Display of numbers.

A.    All new house numbers for residential buildings shall be internally lighted and shall be continuously lit from sunset to sunrise. The numbers shall be posted on the front of the building near the front or main entrances. The numbers shall be a minimum of two (2) inches high and the numbers and background shall have contrasting colors.

B.    All nonresidential buildings shall display numbers near the front or main entrance. The numbers shall be a minimum of five (5) inches high and the numbers and background shall have contrasting colors. Where nonresidential buildings have more than one address, and there is a rear exit for the particular address, the numbers shall be posted on the rear door also. (Ord. 4-87 § 5)


7.08.050 Applicability.

A.    Whenever the numbers are not displayed on existing nonresidential buildings as required in Section 7.04.040, the owner or occupant of the existing building shall after ten (10) days’ written notice install numbers and names as required or shall be guilty of an infraction.

B.    Each owner or occupant shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this section is committed, continued, or permitted by such person. (Ord. 5-89 § 1: Ord. 4-87 § 6)


7.08.060 Enforcement officer designated.

This chapter shall be enforced by the City Manager or his designated representative. (Ord. 4-87 § 7)


7.08.070 Street name changes.

The following procedure shall apply to the changing of street names:

A.    Authority. The City Council may, by resolution, change the name of any street within the city if the street name is identical or similar to another street name in Alameda County, if one continuous street is known by more than one name, if a street different from the official name is in common use, or for other just cause.

B.    Initiation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a street name change may be initiated by any of the following methods:

1.    By action of the City Council;

2.    By action of the Planning Commission;

3.    By request of any adjoining local government;

4.    By petition representing not less than twenty percent (20%) of the households or addresses on the street to be renamed, except that the petition need not represent more than ten (10) addresses.

C.    Procedure. When a street name change has been initiated pursuant to subsection B of this section, a public hearing shall be scheduled before the Planning Commission. At least ten (10) days prior to the public hearing, the city Community Development Director shall cause notice of said hearing to be posted in conspicuous places along said street, said notice to contain letters a minimum of one-eighth (1/8) inch in height reading “NOTICE OF PROPOSED STREET NAME CHANGE” along with a general description of the proposal. The city Community Development Director shall also cause notice of said hearing to be mailed to each owner, as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll, of property along said street at least ten (10) days prior to the public hearing.

After the closing of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council. If the Planning Commission recommends a change, the City Council may adopt a resolution putting the recommended change into effect without a hearing, or the City Council may hold a public hearing at its option. The City Council shall not change any street name contrary to the Planning Commission recommendation without first holding a public hearing thereon. If the Planning Commission recommendation is for no change, the matter may be summarily dismissed by the City Council or a public hearing on the proposal may be scheduled. If the City Council is to conduct a public hearing, the notice requirement for said hearing shall be the same as contained in the first paragraph of this subsection.

D.    Exceptions. In the event there are no addresses in use on a street the name of which is to be changed, or if all households or occupants on such street consent in writing to the change, the Council may make such change without referral to the Planning Commission and without a public hearing.

E.    New Street Names. Names for new streets shall be established by the adoption of a resolution by the City Council or by approval of a final subdivision map or final parcel map containing staff-reviewed and approved names. No public hearing need be held.

F.    Referral. No new street shall be named nor shall any street name be changed without first referring all proposed names to the City Planning Department, Dougherty Regional Fire Authority, United States Post Office, county of Alameda, each adjoining city, the city Police Department, and any other agency as approved by the City Council. Upon receipt of replies from these agencies, or upon the expiration of fifteen (15) days after notice was sent, the city Community Development Director shall forward his findings and recommendations to the Planning Commission or City Council, whichever has primary jurisdiction.

G.    City Clerk Duties. Whenever the name of any street is adopted, established or changed, the City Clerk shall promptly forward a copy of the resolution providing for such new name, change of name, or house number to the Dougherty Regional Fire Authority, United States Post Office, county of Alameda, each adjoining city, the city Police Department, and any other agency as approved by the City Council, and those property owners affected by the name change.

Article I. General Provisions


7.12.010 Findings.

The City Council of the city does find and declare as follows:

A.    That as areas of the city become more thickly urbanized, the demand for utility distribution facilities supplying electric, communication, and similar services increases to the point that the public welfare requires the removal of poles and overhead wires and associated overhead structures and the underground installation of wires and facilities;

B.    That it is in the best interest of the residents and persons using the street, highways, and in such areas to require the undergrounding of existing utility distribution facilities at the time of and coincidental with major street improvements occurring in such areas because of less disruption of traffic, and for the better preservation, maintenance, and protection of the public street, highways, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks;

C.    That it is declared to be in the public interest and in the interest of members of the public using such public streets and highways, because of economies which may accrue both to property owners in the vicinity and to the city in the construction, maintenance, and repair of such public facilities, and in the reduction of hazards, delays, and increases in the safety of persons using same, and residing adjacent thereto and services by such utility distribution systems, to provide for the undergrounding of such utility distribution systems at the same time and coincidental with major street improvements occurring in such areas;

D.    That in order to accomplish such purposes, it is necessary to provide for the creation of special undergrounding districts within which the person supplying such utility services and the users of same shall cooperate to accomplish the undergrounding of such utility service systems and the undergrounding of connection thereto by the users of such service, in accordance with the rules and regulations on file with the California Public Utilities Commission. (Ord. 41-87 § 1)


7.12.020 Purpose.

The purposes and object of this chapter are to accomplish the foregoing results, and the provisions thereof shall be liberally construed so as to give full effect to the accomplishment of such purpose and object. (Ord. 41-87 § 2)

7.24.010 Findings of fact, purpose and methods—Generally.

Findings of fact, purpose and methods for reducing flood losses are set out in Sections 7.24.020 through 7.24.040. (Ord. 42-87 § 1.0: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.020 Findings of fact.

A.    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B.    These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 42-87 § 1.1: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A.    To protect human life and health;

B.    To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C.    To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D.    To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E.    To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F.    To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G.    To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

H.    To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 42-87 § 1.2: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A.    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B.    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C.    Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D.    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

E.    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 42-87 § 1.3: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application:

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

Area of Special Flood Hazards. See “Special flood hazard area.”

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) change of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “one hundred (100) year flood”).

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

Substantial Improvement.

A.    “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either:

1.    Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2.    If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

B.    For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration, (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Federal Insurance study in a scientific and engineering report entitled Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated August 18, 1983, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city of Dublin by the Floodplain Administrator. The study and FIRM are on file at 100 Civic Plaza, city of Dublin offices, Dublin, California 94568. (Ord. 13-96 § 3: Ord. 42-87 § 3.2: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.090 Compliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 42-87 § 3.3: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.100 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 42-87 § 3.4: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.110 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A.    Considered as minimum requirements;

B.    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;

C.    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 42-87 § 3.5: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.120 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or the Federal Insurance Administration of any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 13-96 § 4: Ord. 42-87 § 3.6: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))

C.    Elevation and Floodproofing.

1.    New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(2) of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

2.    Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (C)(1) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:

a.    Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level, the structure is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b.    Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

c.    Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

3.    All new construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.

a.    Have a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

4.    Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 7.24.210. (Ord. 13-96 § 8: Ord. 42-87 § 5.1: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))

B.    Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. (Ord. 42-87 § 5.4: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.211 Standards for recreational vehicles.

All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A, A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map must either:

1.    Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

2.    Meet the permit requirements of Section 7.24.130 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 7.24.210. (Ord. 13-96 § 10)


7.24.220 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 7.24.080 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A.    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;

B.    If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 7.24.170. (Ord. 13-96 § 11: Ord. 42-87 § 5.5: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.240 Appeal board.

A.    The City Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B.    The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C.    In passing upon such applications, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable;

6.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site;

11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges.

D.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 7.24.130 and 7.24.170 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

E.    Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F.    The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 13-96 § 13: Ord. 42-87 § 6.1: Ord. 13 § 1 (part))


7.24.250 Conditions for variances.

A.    Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.

B.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

C.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, consideration of the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D.    Variances shall only be issued upon:

1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E.    Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section and Section 7.24.240(D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

F.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Board in the office of the Recorder of the county of Alameda and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

7.30.020 Threshold for covered projects.

A.    Covered Projects. All construction, demolition, and renovation projects within the city, the total costs of which are greater than or equal to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) (“covered projects”), shall comply with this chapter. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this chapter shall subject the project applicant to the full range of enforcement mechanisms set forth in Section 7.30.090.

B.    Noncovered Projects. Applicants for construction, demolition, and renovation projects within the city whose total costs are less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) (“noncovered projects”) shall be encouraged to divert at least sixty-five percent (65%) of all project-related construction and demolition debris.

C.    City-Sponsored Projects. All city-sponsored construction, demolition, and renovation projects, whose total costs are equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), shall be considered “covered projects” for the purposes of this chapter and shall submit a waste management plan (“WMP”) to the WMP Compliance Official prior to beginning any construction or demolition activities and shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.030 Submission of waste management plan.

A.    WMP Forms. Applicants for a plan check involving any covered project shall complete and submit a waste management plan on a WMP form approved by the city for this purpose. The WMP shall be submitted for review with the first plan check of an individual project or at the first check of a residential master plan in the case of a residential project. The completed WMP shall indicate all of the following:

1.    The estimated volume or weight of project construction and demolition debris, by materials type, to be generated;

2.    The maximum volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling;

3.    The vendor or facility that the applicant proposes to use to collect or receive that material;

4.    The estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition materials that will be landfilled; and

5.    The total square footage of the project.

B.    Calculating Volume and Weight of Debris. In estimating the volume or weight of materials identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.

C.    Deconstruction. In preparing the WMP, applicants for a plan check involving the removal of all or part of an existing structure shall consider deconstruction, to the maximum extent feasible, and shall make the materials generated thereby available for salvage prior to landfilling. (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.040 Performance security.

A.    Time and Amount of Security. The applicant for any new commercial building (regardless of valuation) or for any covered project with a total project value greater than or equal to one million dollars ($1,000,000) shall submit a performance security before the issuance of a building or demolition permit. For residential projects, a performance security shall be submitted for each phase and shall be calculated using the following formula: (project square footage) x (60/2000) x ($35) + $2,738. This means that the total square footage of the project shall be multiplied by the average waste generation for all projects types per ton, which is sixty (60) pounds per square foot of project. That number shall then be multiplied by thirty-five dollars ($35), which is the cost of landfilling one (1) ton of material. (This thirty-five dollars ($35) can be increased annually on July 1st, beginning on July 1, 2001, by the increase in the Engineering News Record Cost Construction Index (twenty (20) city average) over the preceding July 1st rate.) That number shall then be increased by the project’s portion of the estimated fine per day that the city would incur for violation of AB 939, which is two thousand seven hundred thirty-eight dollars ($2,738). This number results from the fact that construction and demolition waste equals thirty percent (30%) of waste disposed in landfill, based on four hundred (400) completed projects per year, with a ten thousand dollar ($10,000) per day fine that the city will pay for the violation of AB 939 for three hundred sixty-five (365) days before achieving sixty-five percent (65%) diversion for remodels or seventy-five percent (75%) diversion for new construction [0.30 x ($10,000 x 365)/400].

B.    Form of Security. Acceptable forms of performance security include the following: performance bonds; surety bonds; money orders; letters of credit; certificates of deposit; and cash. (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.050 Review of WMP.

A.    Approval. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, no plan check shall be approved for any covered project unless and until the WMP Compliance Official has approved the WMP. Approval shall not be required, however, where an emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety. The WMP Compliance Official shall only approve a WMP if he or she first determines that all of the following conditions have been met:

1.    The WMP provides all of the information set forth in Section 7.30.030; and

2.    The WMP indicates that the diversion requirements will be met.

If the WMP Compliance Official determines that all of the conditions set forth in this section have been met, he or she shall mark the WMP “approved,” return a copy of the WMP to the applicant, and notify the Building and Safety Division that the WMP has been approved.

B.    Nonapproval. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the WMP is incomplete or fails to indicate that at least sixty-five percent (65%) for remodels or seventy-five percent (75%) for new construction of all construction and demolition debris generated by the project will be reused or recycled, he or she shall either:

1.    Return the WMP to the applicant marked “denied,” including a statement of reasons, and so notify the Building and Safety Division, which shall then immediately stop processing the plan check; or

2.    Return the WMP to the applicant marked “further explanation required.” (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 17-05 § 8: Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.060 Compliance with WMP.

A.    Documentation. Projects that do not post a bond shall submit all documentation prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Projects that submit a bond shall submit all documentation within thirty (30) days after issuing the certificate of occupancy. Phased projects that submit a bond shall submit all documentation within thirty (30) days after issuing the last certificate of occupancy. The documentation shall be submitted by the applicant to the WMP Compliance Official demonstrating that the diversion requirement for the project has been met. The diversion requirement shall be that the applicant has diverted at least sixty-five percent (65%) for remodels or seventy-five percent (75%) for new construction of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling excluding asphalt and concrete debris of which one hundred percent (100%) must be diverted, unless the applicant has been granted an exemption pursuant to Section 7.30.070, in which case the diversion requirement shall be the maximum feasible diversion rate established by the WMP Compliance Official for the project. This documentation shall include all of the following:

1.    Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material;

2.    A copy of the previously approved WMP for the project adding the actual volume or weight of each material diverted and landfilled; and

3.    Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this chapter.

B.    Weight of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled is measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.

C.    Determination of Compliance and Release of Performance Security. The WMP Compliance Official shall review the information submitted under subsection A of this section and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement as follows:

1.    Full Compliance. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, he or she shall cause the full performance security to be released to the applicant within thirty (30) days of the applicant’s submission of the documentation required under subsection A of this section.

2.    Good Faith Effort to Comply. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter. In making this determination, the WMP Compliance Official shall consider the availability of markets for the construction and demolition debris landfilled, the size of the project, and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert construction and demolition debris. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, he or she shall release the performance security, or a percentage thereof, to the applicant within thirty (30) days of the applicant’s submission of the documentation required under subsection A of this section.

3.    Noncompliance. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection A of this section within the required time period, then the performance security shall be forfeited to the city. All forfeited performance securities shall be deposited into a special account and used for the purposes of promoting recycling within the city.

4.    Repeated Noncompliance for Projects That Do Not Post a Bond.

a.    The first instance within a thirty-six (36) month period where a contractor fails to divert sixty-five percent (65%) for a remodel or seventy-five percent (75%) for new construction of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling (excluding asphalt and concrete of which one hundred percent (100%) must be diverted) shall result in a verbal warning.

b.    The second instance within a thirty-six (36) month period where a contractor fails to divert sixty-five percent (65%) for a remodel or seventy-five percent (75%) for new construction of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling (excluding asphalt and concrete of which one hundred percent (100%) must be diverted) shall result in a written warning.

c.    The third instance within a thirty-six (36) month period where a contractor fails to divert sixty-five percent (65%) for a remodel or seventy-five percent (75%) for new construction of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling (excluding asphalt and concrete of which one hundred percent (100%) must be diverted) shall result in a performance security being required for future jobs with a valuation between one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and one million dollars ($1,000,000). (Amended during 10/14 supplement; Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 17-05 § 9: Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.070 Exemptions.

A.    Non-Waste Generating Projects. The WMP Compliance Official shall have the authority to waive the requirement for the bond and/or the WMP for projects that generate a de minimis amount of waste as determined by the WMP Compliance Official.

B.    Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the WMP required under Section 7.30.030. The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.

C.    Meeting with WMP Compliance Official. The WMP Compliance Official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Upon request of the city, the WMP Compliance Official may request that staff from the Alameda County Waste Management Authority attend this meeting or may require the applicant to request a separate meeting with Alameda County Waste Management Authority staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, Alameda County Waste Management Authority staff, the WMP Compliance Official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement.

D.    Granting of Exemption. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the applicant. The WMP Compliance Official shall return a copy of the WMP to the applicant marked “approved for infeasible exemption” and shall notify the Building and Safety Division that the WMP has been approved.

E.    Denial of Exemption. If the WMP Compliance Official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days to resubmit a WMP form in full compliance with Section 7.30.030. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMP, or if the resubmitted WMP does not comply with Section 7.30.030, the WMP Compliance Official shall deny the WMP in accordance with Section 7.30.050(B). (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.080 Appeal.

Appeals of a determination made under this chapter shall be made to the City Manager pursuant to Section 1.04.050 and shall be limited to the following issues: (A) the granting or denial of an exemption; (B) whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with the WMP; and (C) the amount of security to be released. (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))


7.30.090 Enforcement.

A.    Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.

B.    Violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for the first violation, a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200) for the second violation within one (1) year, and a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500) for each additional violation within one (1) year. There shall be a separate infraction for each day on which a violation occurs. Where the violation is the failure to achieve the diversion requirement applicable to the project and the construction and demolition materials from the project have already been landfilled, the violation shall be deemed to have ceased after a period of ten (10) days. The city shall recover costs and attorney’s fees incurred in connection with enforcement of this chapter.

C.    Enforcement pursuant to this section shall be undertaken by the city through its Community Development Director and the City Attorney. (Ord. 17-14 § 4 (part): Ord. 5-00 § 2 (part))

7.32.020 Purpose.

The promotion and preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city and the property situated therein have made necessary the adoption of the building codes referred to in Section 7.32.030 in order to adequately safeguard life, health, property, and general welfare. The purpose of this code is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or groups of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code. (Ord. 12-16 § 4 (Exh. C) (part))


7.32.030 Adoption of building codes.

A.    The 2016 California Building Code, Part 2, Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, a portion of the California Building Standards Code, as defined in the California State Health and Safety Code Section 18901 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as the “state code”), and any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto including the International Building Code, 2015 Edition, including Appendix Chapters C, F, G, H, and I, as published by the International Code Council, and as referenced in and adopted pursuant to California State Health and Safety Code Sections 17922 and 18935, (hereinafter referred to as the “IBC”) are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference herein.

The codes and standards referenced in this code shall be considered part of this code to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where the extent of the reference to a referenced code or standard includes subject matter that is within the scope of this code or the mechanical, plumbing, housing, fire or energy codes, the provisions of these codes, as applicable, shall take precedence over the provisions in the referenced code or standard.

Copies of the adopted codes have been and are now filed in the Office of the Building Official, 100 Civic Plaza, Dublin, California, for use and examination by the public. Said codes are adopted by reference pursuant to Section 50022.4 et seq. of the Government Code of the State of California, and the codes are hereby adopted and incorporated as fully as if set out at length herein, and from the date on which the ordinance codified in this chapter shall take effect, the provisions thereof shall be controlling within the limits of the city of Dublin.

If two (2) or more pertinent limitations are not identical, those limitations shall prevail which provide greater safety to life, health, property, or public welfare.

C.    Buildings shall be made accessible to the physically handicapped as required by Title 24, California Code of Regulations. Whenever there is a conflict between the provisions of this code and Title 24, California Code of Regulations, with respect to the accessibility of buildings to the physically handicapped, the provisions of Title 24 shall prevail.

A.    No well intended to produce fresh groundwater shall be perforated opposite aquifers producing saline water. It is recognized that in some instances production may be desired from areas and/or depths which contain poor or marginal quality water in all aquifers penetrated. It is not the intent of these standards to preclude such situations so long as the integrity of the fresh water supplies is maintained. Final judgment on well construction that would cause intermingling of waters of different qualities shall be at the discretion of the county.

B.    In wells open to fresh water aquifers, penetrated aquifers producing saline water shall be sealed-off as specified in Section 13, Chapter II, Bulletin No. 74, and in Chapter IV, Bulletin 74-2.

C.    Perched saline water shall be excluded from wells by a deep annular seal as specified in Section 9, Chapter II, Bulletin No. 74, and in Chapter IV, Bulletin 74-2.

D.    As a guideline, saline water is considered as water which contains more than two hundred fifty (250) ppm chloride ion. During well construction, the permittee shall provide some provision for the determination of groundwater quality characteristics of the major aquifers penetrated so that a judgment can be made as to whether or not intermingling will take place. Such determination can consist of evaluation of data regarding adjacent wells, evaluation of samples of formation materials encountered. Final judgment as to the probability of intermingling and the need for evaluation of conditions shall be at the discretion of the county.

E.    Backfilling work on exploratory holes, as defined herein, shall be subject to requirements equivalent to those in the destruction of abandoned wells.

F.    All water wells shall be maintained in such a manner that water quality samples can be readily collected. The county shall be empowered to collect water quality samples and to perform tests on any well at any reasonable time.

G.    All work in the construction, repair, reconstruction, and destruction of wells shall be performed by contractors licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Contractors License Law (Chapter 9, Division 3, of the Business and Professions Code) unless exempted by that act.

H.    In no case will an outer casing or conductor casing be an acceptable substitute for a seal. (Ord. 3-88 § 1 (part): § 3-160.5, Alameda County Code)

(Ord. 3-88 § 1 (part): § 3-160.6(2), Alameda County Code)


7.60.160 Emergency abatement.

If the Director of Public Works finds that the condition or operation of a well subject to this chapter is, by its operation or maintenance, causing significant irreparable damage to the groundwater and that it is impracticable to notify the owner or permittee, he may abate the condition without giving notice as required in Section 7.60.140, and the cost thereof shall be a charge against the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll. (Ord. 3-88 § 1 (part): § 3-160.6 (3), Alameda County Code)


7.60.170 Violation—Penalty.

Any person who does any work for which a permit is required by this chapter and who fails to obtain a permit shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500) or by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and such person shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which any such violation is committed, continued, or permitted, and shall be subject to the same punishment as for the original offense.

Article V. Dublin Ranch East Side Storm Drain Benefit District


7.74.250 Purpose. 

The purpose of this article is to create a local benefit district, pursuant to California Government Code Section 66487, to provide for the levy and collection of charges as a condition of approving the development of properties within the benefit district that will necessitate, and benefit from, the construction of storm drain improvements. The owner, developer, or other person holding an interest in property in the benefit district shall be required to pay the city charges equal to their share (according to the benefit analysis) of the actual cost of constructed improvements. Charges for already constructed improvements shall be an amount equal to the proportional benefit to the benefited property of improvements constructed with supplemental capacity that will benefit or be used by the benefited property. (Ord. 6-07 § 1)


7.74.260 Definitions. 

For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:

“Benefit district” means the Dublin Ranch East Side Storm Drain Benefit District, which includes the area described in Recital D of the ordinance codified in this article.

“Benefited property” means a property within the benefit district which receives benefit from the construction of an improvement.

“Financing party” means a property owner, developer, or governmental entity that is required to install improvements which benefit properties within the benefit district.

“Improvement” is defined in Recital C of the ordinance codified in this article.

“Land use entitlement” may include any of the following: a permit or approval granted by the city for the development of property, a conditional use permit, final subdivision map, a tentative subdivision map, a development agreement, a grading permit, and a site design review approval. (Ord. 6-07 § 2)


7.74.270 Adoption of local drainage plan. 

Pursuant to Government Code Section 66483, the City Council hereby adopts the Engineer’s Report, attached to the ordinance codified in this article, as the local drainage plan for the benefit district. (Ord. 6-07 § 3)


7.74.280 Creation of local benefit district.

Pursuant to its authority under Government Code Section 66487, the City Council hereby creates the Dublin Ranch East Side Storm Drain Benefit District, a local benefit district consisting of the benefited properties labeled Parcels 1 through 11 as shown in Figure 4 of the Engineer’s Report, identified by their Assessor Parcel Numbers listed in Figure 6 of the Engineer’s Report, and those remaining portions of the benefit district referred to in the Engineer’s Report as the Dublin Ranch Drainage Shed. (Ord. 6-07 § 4)


7.74.290 Obligations imposed. 

Upon the approval of a land use entitlement for any benefited property in the district, the owner, developer, or other person with an interest in such property shall be required, as a condition of approving the land use entitlement, to pay the applicable benefit charges for the property, as set forth in Figure 6 of the Engineer’s Report as thereafter adjusted for interest in the manner set forth below. Payment for a benefited property within the benefit area shall be required at the time the city approves any final or parcel map on that property or at the time the city issues a building permit on that property, whichever is earlier. To account for interest during the period between the completion of the improvements and the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, the charges listed in Figure 6 of the Engineer’s Report shall be increased by amounts that would have been applied using the interest adjustment procedure described below, if the charges had been adjusted for interest each July 1st following the January 1, 2005, completion date of the improvements. These amounts are as follows: 1.87 percent for the July 1, 2005, adjustment; 3.42 percent for the July 1, 2006, adjustment; and 4.94 percent for the July 1, 2007, adjustment. Following the first such increase, each increase shall be applied to the previously adjusted benefit charge. Beginning with the interest adjustment to be effective July 1, 2008, the interest-adjusted benefit charges shall be increased automatically at the beginning of each fiscal year by the rate of return that the city earns from its local agency investment fund (“LAIF”). The annual increases will be calculated as follows:

A.    On or about each July 1st, the City Finance Department will prepare a schedule setting forth the revised benefit charges for the particular fiscal year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the schedule has not been prepared for a particular fiscal year, the applicable fee shall nonetheless be based on the adjusted amount.

B.    The adjusted benefit charges shall be determined by multiplying the benefit charge from the previous fiscal year by the average return earned by the State of California Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), calculated using the average of four (4) quarters ending the previous March 31st. (LAIF quarterly rates are typically not available until one (1) month following the end of the quarter.)

In that event, the total reimbursable owed to the financing party for facilities construction shall be reduced by an amount equal to such credit. (Ord. 6-07 § 6)


7.74.310 Use of charge revenue.

Charges collected from owners of benefited properties shall be used to reimburse financing parties pursuant to a reimbursement agreement approved by the City Manager in accordance with Section 7.74.330. (Ord. 6-07 § 7)

A building permit shall not be issued until the green building documentation is approved under this section or an exemption has been granted.

C.    Not Approved. If the Building Official determines that the green building documentation fails to indicate the project will achieve the required green building program rating, the Building Official shall deny the documentation and return the documentation to the applicant, including a statement of reasons for denial and measures required to conform to this chapter.

D. Resubmittal. If the documentation is returned to the applicant as not approved, the applicant may resubmit the documentation with such modifications and additions as may be required for approval. (Ord. 12-16 § 9 (Exh. H) (part))


7.94.110 Construction and verification.

A.    After approval of the green building documentation, any changes to the construction or design that may have an effect on the green building program rating the project will obtain must be submitted to the Building Official. Prior to the issuance of occupancy permits, the applicant must submit a final green building program checklist to the Building Official, verifying installation of the required measures and certifying the building meets the required green building program rating. If measures have been added or omitted the final checklist must reflect the changes.

B.    If an applicant using the GreenPoint rating system voluntarily submits documentation to Build It Green for a GreenPoint Rated Certificate, proof of receipt of the GreenPoint Rated Certificate will be accepted in lieu of a revised green building program checklist.

If an applicant using the LEEDtm for Homes Green Building Rating System voluntarily registers his or her project with the U.S. Green Building Council for LEEDtm certification at the same or higher green building program rating than required by this chapter, proof of said registration and certification will be accepted in lieu of a revised green building program checklist.

If an applicant voluntarily obtains and submits certification under either the GreenPoint program or the LEEDtm for Homes program, then the Building Official may reduce the scope of the verification process as appropriate.

C.    The Building Official shall not be responsible for verifying the green building program measures implemented during construction, nor shall the Building Official’s acceptance of a revised green building program checklist indicate a building has met the green building program rating required by the city. (Ord. 12-16 § 9 (Exh. H) (part))


7.94.120 Infeasibility exemption.

A.    Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with Sections 7.94.080 through 7.94.110, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the green building documentation required under Section 7.94.090. In applying for an exemption, the burden is on the applicant to show infeasibility. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, availability of markets for materials to be recycled, availability of green building materials, technology, and compatibility of green building requirements with other building standards. The applicant shall include with the green building documentation the green building program rating he or she believes is feasible and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with this chapter. The Building Official shall review the information provided by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of complying with the required green building program rating.

B.    Granting of Exemption. If the Building Official determines it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the green building program rating due to unique circumstances described in the exemption application, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible green building program rating reasonably achievable for the project and shall enter the number of credits on the green building documentation, which shall be marked “Approved with Exemption.”

C.    Denial of Exemption. If the Building Official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the requirements of this chapter, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days to resubmit the required green building program checklist and materials to be in compliance with this chapter. If the applicant fails to resubmit the green building documentation, the Building Official shall deny the project in accordance with Section 7.94.100(C). (Ord. 12-16 § 9 (Exh. H) (part))

Chapter 8.04 TITLE, PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY


8.04.010 Title.

This Title shall be known as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Dublin, Title 8 of the Dublin Municipal Code, hereafter referred to as the “Ordinance”.


8.04.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote and protect the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience and general welfare and to preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of the City by providing regulations to ensure an appropriate mix of land uses, and that each land use relates properly to adjacent land uses in an orderly manner, and for the following more particularly specified purposes:

A.    Implement the Dublin General Plan and Specific Plans, and to guide and manage the future growth of the city in accordance with those plans.

B.    Protect, retain, and enhance the character and stability of existing development, and to encourage orderly and beneficial new development.

C.    Provide adequate light, air, privacy, and convenience of access to property, and to secure safety from fire and other dangers.

D.    Prevent overcrowding the land and undue congestion of the population.

E.    Manage the distribution of population in accordance with the availability of the natural resources, and public facilities and services necessary to support a growing City.

F.    Protect and preserve the natural environment of the City of Dublin.

G.    Regulate the location, use, and design of buildings and land uses so as to reduce hazards to the public resulting from the inappropriate location, use, or design of buildings and land uses in relation to natural and built hazards and resources, existing buildings and land uses, and the existing or prospective traffic movements on the City’s roadway system.

H.    Attain the physical, social, and economic advantages resulting from comprehensive and orderly land use and resource planning.


8.04.030 Authority and General Plan Consistency.

A.    This Ordinance is enacted based on the authority vested in the City of Dublin by the State of California, including, but not limited to, the State Constitution, Section 65000 and subsequent sections of the California Government Code, the Housing Act, and the Health and Safety Code.

B.    It is the policy of the City of Dublin that the Zoning Ordinance be used to implement the General Plan and Specific Plans. The Dublin City Council intends that this Ordinance be consistent with the Dublin General Plan and Specific Plans, and that any land use or development approved in compliance with this Ordinance also be consistent with the Dublin General Plan and applicable Specific Plans.


8.04.040 Applicability of the Zoning Ordinance.

This Ordinance applies to all land uses and development within the City of Dublin as follows:

A.    New land uses, building permits, structures, and changes to them. Compliance with all of the following requirements, to the satisfaction of the Director of Community Development, is necessary for any person or public agency to lawfully establish a new land use or structure, issue a building permit, or to alter or replace any land use or structure:

1.    The proposed land use must be allowed within the zoning district that applies to the site.

2.    The proposed use of land or structure, development, or related division of land must be legal or non-conforming and satisfy all applicable requirements and development regulations of this Ordinance, including but not limited to lot area, lot square footage per dwelling unit, lot dimensions, maximum residential use per lot, setbacks, distance between residences, maximum lot coverage, common useable outdoor space, height limits, sign regulations, and all other requirements of this Title.

3.    Any Permit or other approval required by the applicable zoning district or other provision of this Title must be obtained in compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance and any applicable conditions of approval of that Permit must be met to the satisfaction of the Director of Community Development.

B.    Continuation of an existing land use or structure. It is unlawful and a violation of the Dublin Municipal Code for anyone to maintain the use of a parcel that violates any provision of Title 8; provided, however, a land use or structure that was lawfully established before this Ordinance was enacted or before enactment of any applicable amendment to this Ordinance, may continue, provided no expansion or modification to said pre-existing non-conforming uses or structures shall be permitted, except as allowed by Chapter 8.140, Non-Conforming Structures and Uses.

C.    Subdivision of land. Any subdivision of land within the City of Dublin occurring after the effective date of this Ordinance shall be consistent with the minimum lot size requirements, lot square footage per dwelling unit requirements, all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance, and with Chapter 9 of the Dublin Municipal Code relating to subdivisions.

D.    Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on projects in progress. The enactment of this Ordinance or amendments to its requirements may have the effect of imposing different standards on new land uses, development and/or structures than those that applied to existing land uses, development and/or structures. Following the effective date of this Ordinance, or any amendments to this Ordinance, the following provisions shall apply:

1.    Pending applications. All land use permit applications that have been determined by the Department to be complete before the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment, will be processed according to the regulations in effect when the application was accepted as complete.

2.    Approved projects not yet under construction. Any structure authorized by an Conditional Use Permit, Site Development Review, Temporary Use Permit, or Variance, for which construction has not begun as of the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment, may still be constructed in compliance with the approved permit, as long as construction is completed and the approved land use is established before the expiration of the permit or, where applicable, before the expiration of any approved time extension.

3.    Projects under construction. A structure that is under construction pursuant to a valid Building Permit on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment, may be completed and need not be changed to satisfy any new or different requirements of this Ordinance as long as construction is beyond the approval of the first inspection on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment, and provided that construction is diligently prosecuted to completion. Such a structure shall be deemed to be a lawfully existing building.

4.    Other requirements may still apply. Nothing in this Ordinance shall eliminate the need for obtaining any other permits required by the City, or any permit, approval or entitlement required by other chapters of the City Municipal Code or by the regulations of any City Department or by any County, regional, State, or Federal agency.

5.    Permits, approvals, and licenses issued in compliance with Ordinance. All permits and licenses shall be issued by the City in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance, after the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment. Any permit, approval, or license issued in conflict with this Ordinance shall be void.


8.04.050 Responsibility for Administration.

This Ordinance shall be administered by the Dublin City Council, Planning Commission, Director of Community Development, Zoning Administrator, and the Department of Community Development, as provided in Chapter 8.128, Authority to Administer Title 8.


8.04.060 Interpretation.

The Director of Community Development is assigned the responsibility and authority to interpret the requirements of this Ordinance. This Section provides rules for resolving questions about the meaning or applicability of any part of this Ordinance.

A.    Language. The meaning and construction of words and phrases as set forth shall apply throughout this Ordinance, except where the context of such words or phrases clearly indicates a different meaning or construction. Definitions contained in the Uniform Building Code shall be applicable except when in conflict with definitions contained in this Ordinance, in which case the Zoning Ordinance definition shall apply. The following general rules of construction shall apply to the textual provisions of this Ordinance:

1.    Headings. The section and subsection headings of this Ordinance do not govern, limit, modify, or in any manner affect the scope, meaning or intent of any provision of this Ordinance.

2.    Illustrations. In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text of any provision and any illustration, the text of the provision shall control.

3.    Shall, May, and Should. “Shall” is always mandatory and not discretionary. “May” is permissive and discretionary. “Should” is advisory and not mandatory.

4.    Tense, Number, and Gender. Words used in the present tense include the past and future tense. Words used in the singular include the plural, and the plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. The masculine and feminine genders are both inclusive of the masculine, feminine, and neuter.

5.    Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, the following conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:

“And” indicates that all connected items or provisions shall apply.

“Or” indicates that the connected items or provisions may apply singly or in any combination.

“Either . . . Or” indicates that the connected items or provisions shall apply singly but not in combination.

6.    Number of Days. Whenever a number of days is specified in this Ordinance, or in any permit, condition of approval or notice issued or given as provided in this Ordinance, such number of days shall be construed as calendar days, except that such time limits shall extend to the following working day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a Saturday, Sunday or any City holiday.

7.    Minimum Requirements. When interpreting and applying the regulations of this Ordinance, all provisions shall be considered to be the minimum requirements, unless stated otherwise.

8.    Text Error. Where the Director of Community Development determines through review of the public record of a City Council hearing and action that the text of the Ordinance is in error, the Director of Community Development shall have the authority to correct the error to make the Ordinance text consistent with the action of the City Council.

B.    Zoning District Boundaries. If there is uncertainty about the location of any zoning district boundary shown on the official zoning map, the following rules are to be used in resolving the uncertainty.

1.    Lot, alley or street lines. Where zoning district boundaries approximately follow lot, alley, or street lines, the lot lines and street and alley centerlines shall be construed as the district boundaries.

2.    Divided parcel. If a zoning district boundary divides a parcel and the boundary line location is not specified by distances printed on the zoning map, the location of the boundary will be determined by using the scale appearing on the zoning map.

3.    Vacated or abandoned public street or alley. Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly the public street or alley will be included within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned public street or alley.

4.    Physical feature. Where a zoning district boundary is shown as approximately following a physical feature such as a stream, drainage channel, topographic contour line, power line, or railroad right-of-way, the boundary location shall be determined by the Director of Community Development, based upon the character of the particular feature used as a boundary.

5.    Map Error. Where the Director of Community Development determines through review of the public record of a City Council hearing and action on a rezoning that a zoning district boundary, line, or other information on the official zoning map has been drafted in error, the Director of Community Development shall have the authority to correct the error to make the official map consistent with the action of the City Council.

C.    Permitted Uses of Land. If a proposed use of land is not specifically included in Chapter 8.12, Zoning Districts And Permitted Uses of Land, Chapter 8.16, Agricultural Zoning District, Chapter 8.20, Residential Zoning Districts, Chapter 8.24, Commercial Zoning Districts, and Chapter 8.28, Industrial Zoning Districts, the use shall not be allowed, except as follows:

1.    Permitted. The Director of Community Development may determine that a proposed use not included in the Use Types permitted by the above sections is permitted if the Director finds all of the following:

a.    Characteristics and activities. The characteristics of, and activities associated with the proposed use are in substantial conformity with those of one or more of the uses included in the Use Types permitted by the zoning district, and will not involve a higher level of activity, intensity, or population density than the uses included in the Use Types permitted in the zoning district.

b.    General Plan and Specific Plans. The proposed use will be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the General Plan and applicable Specific Plans.

c.    Purpose and Intent of zoning district. The proposed use will meet the purpose and intent of the zoning district that applies to the site.

2.    Treated in Same Manner. When the Director of Community Development determines that a proposed, but unincluded, use is in substantial conformity with an included and therefore permitted use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the included use in determining where it is allowed, what permits or approvals are required and what other standards and requirements of this Ordinance apply.

3.    Referral to Planning Commission. The Director of Community Development may refer questions about proposed but unincluded uses directly to the Planning Commission for a determination at a public hearing.

D.    Conflicting Requirements.

1.    Other Municipal Code provisions. If conflicts occur between requirements of this Ordinance, or between this Ordinance and other regulations of the City, the most restrictive shall apply.

2.    General Plan, Specific Plans. Where conflicts occur between this Ordinance and the General Plan or Specific Plans, the provisions of the General Plan and the Specific Plan shall apply.

3.    Private Agreements. It is not the intended that the requirements of this Ordinance interfere with, repeal, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, or other agreement that existed when this Ordinance became effective. Where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private requirement, the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply. Where a covenant or private agreement imposes a greater restriction than this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall still apply without diminishing any private agreements or restrictions. The City will not enforce any private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.

E.    Official Interpretations. Whenever the Director of Community Development determines that the applicability or meaning of any of the requirements of this Ordinance are unclear generally or as applied to a specific case, the Director of Community Development may issue an official interpretation. Official interpretations shall be:

1.    In writing, and shall quote the provisions of this Ordinance being interpreted, together with an explanation of their meaning or applicability in the particular or general circumstances that caused the need for interpretation.

2.    Distributed to the City Council, Planning Commission, City Attorney, City Clerk, and Department staff.

Any Ordinance provisions that are determined by the Director of Community Development to be unclear (with the exception of text and map errors addressed above) will be corrected by amending the Zoning Ordinance as soon as is practical. Until amendments can occur, the Director of Community Development shall maintain a complete record of all official interpretations, available for public review, and indexed by the number of the Zoning Ordinance section that is the subject of the interpretation.

F.    Appeal and Referral. Any interpretations of this Ordinance by the Director of Community Development may be appealed as provided in Chapter 8.136, Appeals. The Director of Community Development may refer any interpretation of this Ordinance to the Planning Commission for a decision at a public hearing.

E.    Prohibit the development of incompatible uses that are detrimental to the general health, safety and welfare and to existing and future airport operations.

F.    Require noise attenuated construction within the airport environs.

G.    Comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Ord. 19-14 (September 2014)


8.35.020 Definitions.

For purposes of these regulations, certain words or phrases shall be interpreted as set forth in this Chapter unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended. Where any of the definitions of this Chapter may conflict with the definitions in Chapter 8.08 (Definitions) of the Dublin Zoning Ordinance, the definitions in this chapter (Airport Overlay Zoning District) shall prevail for the purposes of this Chapter.

A.    Definitions (A-Z)

Airport Influence Area (AIA). The area in which current or future airport-related noise, overflight, safety and/or airspace protection factors may significantly affect land uses or necessitate restrictions on those uses. The Airport Influence Area is designated by the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) as its planning area boundary for the airport and the two terms can be considered synonymous.

Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). A commission authorized under the provisions of the California Public Utilities Code Sections 21670 et seq. and established, in any county within which a public-use airport is located, for the purpose of promoting compatibility between airports and the land uses surrounding them.

Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP). A plan adopted by the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) which sets forth policies for promoting compatibility between airports and the land uses which surround them. This plan is sometimes referred to as an Airport Land Use Policy Plan (ALUPP).

Airport Protection Area (APA). An area within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) established to prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses near the vicinity of the Livermore Municipal Airport.

Existing Land Use. A land use that either physically exists or else for which government approvals have been obtained through one or more of the following:

1.    A valid building permit has been issued;

2.    A legally valid development agreement has been approved and remains in effect pursuant to Government Code Section 65864 et seq. which provides that, “A development agreement shall specify duration of the agreement, the permitted uses of the property, the density or intensity of use, the maximum height and size of proposed buildings and provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes”;

3.    A tentative parcel or tract map has been approved and the original period, excluding extensions, has not expired;

4.    A vesting tentative parcel or tract map has been approved, pursuant to Government Code Section 66498.1(b) which “confer a vested right to proceed with development standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved”;

5.    A parcel or final map has been recorded; or

6.    A use permit, planned unit development or Planned Development zoning indicating the permitted uses of the property, the density or intensity of use, the maximum height and size of proposed buildings and provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes that has been approved and not yet expired.

Helipad. A small, designated area, usually with a prepared surface, on a heliport, airport, landing/take-off area, apron/ramp, or movement area used for take-off, landing or parking of helicopters.

Heliport. A facility used for operating, basing, housing, and maintaining helicopters.

Hospitals. Any facility other than a private physician’s office or outpatient clinic, in which care is offered to individuals who exhibit physical, emotional, or mental disability or illness. Examples include acute care hospitals, freestanding emergency rooms, nursing homes, board and care facilities, birthing centers, mental institutions and rehabilitation centers.

Hotels and Motels. Any structure or facility intended or suitable for short-term occupancy by persons as a temporary dwelling. Examples include hotels, motels, bed and breakfast inns, youth hostels, pensions, and temporary shelters.

Multifamily Residential (land use). Any project, development or other land use in which separate families or individuals occupy dwelling units which share a common wall or a common roof, or occupy a common legal parcel of real estate. Examples include duplexes, triplexes, quadriplexes, apartment buildings, condominiums, townhouses and residential courts. In addition, institutional uses such as hospitals, nursing homes, board and care facilities, correctional institutions and boarding schools, which entail the long-term occupancy of a single structure by unrelated individuals are considered multifamily residential.

Nonconforming Use. An Existing Land Use that does not conform to an adopted or subsequently amended airport land use compatibility plan.

Office Buildings (land use). Any development, regardless of structure size, which includes significant floor space suitable for use by personnel performing or providing clerical, professional, or financial services as a primary use. The presence of limited office space for support of another primary function is not considered an office building under this definition.

Redevelopment. Construction of a new use (though this does not have to be a new land use type) to replace an Existing Land Use at a density or intensity that may differ from the existing use.

Single-Family Residential (land use). The use of land for dwellings in such manner that no more than one primary dwelling unit is developed on each legal parcel and the size of each legal parcel is less than one acre. Ord. 19-14 (September 2014)


8.35.030 Applicability.

The Airport Overlay Zoning District shall apply to all lands within the Airport Overlay Zone mapped on the official Zoning Map. The Airport Overlay Zone is coterminous with the Livermore Municipal Airport, Airport Influence Area (AIA) as identified in Figure 3-1 and described in Section 3.1.1 of Chapter 3 of the adopted Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP (August 2012).

The Airport Overlay Zoning District is a designation in addition to the Planned Development (PD) Zoning District designation that each property in the Airport Overlay Zoning District retains. The PD Zoning District ordinance for each property contains all the information regarding permitted and conditionally permitted uses and development standards and regulations while the Airport Overlay Zoning District provides a mechanism to review land uses within the District for consistency with the ALUCP for the Livermore Municipal Airport.

All permitted and conditionally permitted uses set forth in a PD Zoning District that was adopted and in effect prior to August 2012 shall be deemed Existing Land Uses pursuant to the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP. The Alameda County ALUC has no authority over Existing Land Uses unless changes to an Existing Land Use results in an increase of nonconformity with ALUCP policies and the change would increase the intensity or density of the use beyond what was permitted by the Existing Land Use (Reference: ALUCP Chapter 2, Section 2.7.5.7(b)). Ord. 19-14 (September 2014)


8.35.040 Projects Subject to Compliance with this Chapter.

A.    Projects Subject to Review by the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). The following land use actions shall be reviewed by the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) for compliance with the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP prior to approval by the City (Reference: ALUCP, Chapter 2, Section 2.6.1):

1.    General Plan or Specific Plan Amendments. General Plan or Specific Plan Amendments that propose new land uses or increase the intensity or density of Existing Land Uses within the Airport Influence Area (AIA). Existing Land Uses are defined in Section 8.35.020.A (Definitions A-Z).

2.    Zoning Ordinance Amendments. Zoning Ordinance Amendments that:

a.    Introduce a new land use (i.e. Use Type) within the AIA not contemplated by an Existing Land Use; or

b.    Increase the intensity or density of, or permitted by, an Existing Land Use within the AIA; or

c.    Involve any of the following airport-related concerns:

1.    Exposure to aircraft noise;

3.    Redevelopment. Redevelopment of a property that:

a.    Replaces an Existing Land Use with a new use; or

b.    Increases the intensity or density of, or permitted by, an Existing Land Use which is consistent with the General Plan and/or Specific Plan but does not conform to the compatibility criteria set forth in the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP.

4.    Airport and Heliport Plans. Any proposal for a new airport, heliport or helipad, for public or private use, if the facility requires a State Airport Permit and any proposal to expand an existing airport or heliport that is not included in an approved master plan for the airport or heliport and such expansion will require an amendment to a State Airport Permit.

B.    Projects Subject to Review by the City. All ministerial actions and all discretionary actions shall be reviewed by the City for compliance with the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP and this Chapter prior to approval.

1.    Ministerial Actions. Projects subject to a ministerial action including, but not limited to, Business License applications, Building Permit applications, Zoning Clearance applications and Site Development Review Waivers shall document compliance with Section 8.35.050 (Development Regulations) prior to approval.

b.    Eating and drinking establishments; and

c.    Other miscellaneous commercial facilities.

B.    Public Safety. Land use compatibility standards are intended to minimize the risk to people and property on the ground as well as to people in an aircraft in the event of an accident or emergency landing occurring outside the airport boundary.

1.    Airport Influence Area (AIA). The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to have a high risk of exposing persons to airport-related safety hazards and are therefore prohibited within the AIA and the Airport Overlay Zone:

a.    Field and stalk crops;

b.    Dry farm and grain;

c.    Forest reserves; and

d.    Fish and game reserves.

The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to be “conditional” within the AIA. “Conditional” means that the uses may be compatible with airport operations depending on their location, size, bulk, height, density and intensity of use. Refer to Sections 3.3.2.8 and 3.3.2.9 of the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP (August 2012) for conditional criteria.

a.    Medium to large indoor assembly (≥300 <1,000 people);

b.    Waterways (rivers, creeks, swamps, bays, lakes);

c.    Reservoirs, quarry lakes, detention ponds, aquifer recharge, recycled water storage, flood control or water conveyance channels; and

d.    Water treatment.

2.    Airport Influence Area (AIA), Safety Zone 6. The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to have a high risk of exposing persons to airport-related safety hazards and are therefore prohibited in those portions of the AIA and Airport Overlay Zone identified as “Zone 6: Traffic Pattern Zone.” Refer to Figure 35-1.

a.    Schools (K-12);

b.    High capacity indoor assembly (≥1,000 people);

c.    Large outdoor assembly (≥1,000 people);

d.    Orchards;

e.    Power plants; and

f.    Golf courses.

The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to be “conditional” within those portions of the AIA identified as “Zone 6: Traffic Pattern Zone.” Refer to Figure 35-1. “Conditional” means that the uses may be compatible with airport operations depending on their location, size, bulk, height, density and intensity of use. Refer to Sections 3.3.2.8 and 3.3.2.9 of the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP (August 2012) for conditional criteria.

a.    Commercial daycare (≥6);

b.    Inpatient facilities (i.e. hospitals, health care facilities, nonambulatory medical centers, sanitariums, psychiatric facilities);

c.    Congregate care facilities, ambulatory and nonambulatory (i.e. assisted living, convalescent, rehabilitation facilities, retirement homes);

d.    Correctional facilities;

e.    Low capacity indoor assembly (≤300 people); and

f.    Vineyards.

3.    Airport Influence Area (AIA), Safety Zone 7. The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to be “conditional” within those portions of the AIA identified as “Zone 7: Area between Zone 6 and the AIA boundary.” Refer to Figure 35-1. “Conditional” means that the uses may be compatible with airport operations depending on their location, size, bulk, height, density and intensity of use. Refer to Sections 3.3.2.8 and 3.3.2.9 of the Livermore Municipal Airport ALUCP (August 2012) for conditional criteria.

a.    High capacity indoor assembly (≥1,000 people);

b.    Medium to large indoor assembly (≥300 <1,000 people);

c.    Large outdoor assembly (≥1,000 people);

d.    Waterways (rivers, creeks, swamps, bays, lakes);

e.    Reservoirs, quarry lakes, detention ponds, aquifer recharge, recycled water storage, flood control or water conveyance channels;

f.    Water treatment;

g.    Power plants; and

h.    Golf courses.

4.    Airport Protection Area (APA). The Airport Protection Area (APA) is an area within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) that has been established to prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses near the Livermore Municipal Airport. Refer to Figure 35-1. The following land uses have been determined by the ALUCP to have a high risk of exposing persons to airport-related safety hazards and are therefore prohibited within the APA:

a.    Single family residential;

b.    Multifamily residential;

c.    Hotels and motels; and

d.    Long term lodging (i.e. dormitories, etc.).

5.    Uses Considered “Conditional.” Uses considered “conditional” may be compatible with airport operations depending on their location, size, bulk, height, density and intensity of use. The primary measure of risk exposure, for people on the ground in the event of an aircraft accident, is the number of people concentrated in a single area. Applications, whether ministerial or discretionary, to establish uses considered “conditional” shall be referred to the Alameda County ALUC for an advisory review. The ALUC will identify any design or locational strategies that could reduce or avoid harm to those on the ground resulting from a potential aircraft accident.

C.    Airspace Protection. Airspace protection standards are intended to reduce the risk of harm to people and property resulting from an aircraft accident by preventing the creation of land use features that can be hazards to the airspace used by aircraft in flight.

1.    Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Review. The following airspace protection standards shall apply to all projects regardless of whether they are proposed within or outside of the Airport Influence Area (AIA).

a.    Proponents of a project shall notify the FAA if a proposed structure may exceed 1 foot in height for every 100 feet from the edge of the nearest runway for a distance up to 20,000 feet.

b.    Proponents of a project shall notify the FAA if a proposed structure is more than 200 feet above ground level at its site.

2.    Other Flight Hazards. The following specific characteristics shall be avoided within the Airport Influence Area (AIA):

a.    Glare or distracting lights that could be mistaken for airport lights;

b.    Sources of dust, heat, steam, or smoke that may impair pilot vision;

c.    Sources of steam or other emissions that may cause thermal plumes or other forms of unstable air that generate turbulence within the flight path;

d.    Sources of electrical interference with aircraft communications or navigation; and

e.    Features that create an increased attraction for wildlife.

D.    Aircraft Overflight. Aircraft overflight standards are intended to provide overflight notification for land uses near the Livermore Municipal Airport. It shall be the responsibility of all owners of property offered for sale or for lease within the Airport Overlay Zoning District to provide the following disclosure prior to selling or leasing property in Dublin:

NOTICE OF AIRPORT IN VICINITY

This property is presently located in the vicinity of an airport, within what is known as an airport influence area. For that reason, the property may be subject to some of the annoyances or inconveniences associated with proximity to airport operations (for example: noise, vibration, or odors). Individual sensitivities to those annoyances can vary from person to person. You may wish to consider what airport annoyances, if any, are associated with the property before you complete your purchase or lease and determine whether they are acceptable to you.

All discretionary actions shall include a condition of approval requiring all owners of property offered for sale or for lease within the Airport Overlay Zoning District to provide the aforementioned disclosure prior to selling or leasing property. For new residential land uses, the overflight notification shall be recorded and appear with the property deed. Ord. 19-14 (September 2014)

Chapter 8.44 ADULT BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT REGULATIONS


8.44.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this section is to establish comprehensive regulations applicable to the location of Adult Business Establishments in the City of Dublin. These regulations are in addition to all other provisions of this Title and apply to those land uses listed in Chapter 8.12, Zoning Districts And Allowable Uses Of Land, such as bookstores, motion picture theaters, etc. which, because of the emphasis or primary orientation of their stock-in-trade or services offered, constitute Adult Business Establishments as defined by this Title. In the event that the provisions of this section conflict with other applicable provisions of this Title, the provisions of this section shall prevail.

Intent. The City Council finds that Adult Business Establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. It is the intent of this Title that such businesses be regulated to ensure that the serious objectionable operational characteristics will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods and to prevent the concentration or clustering of Adult Business Establishments in any one area.


8.44.020 Definitions.

For definitions of Adult Business Establishments and terms used in this Section, please see Chapter 8.08, Definitions.

Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, it is required that all location requirements and regulations be met for a Conditional Use Permit for an Adult Business Establishment to be approved. These requirements and regulations shall be the only standards on which the Conditional Use Permit shall be based.

D.    Narrow, objective and definite standards. In order to implement the Purpose and Intent of this Chapter, narrow, objective and definite standards shall be imposed in Sections 8.44.050 and 8.44.060 below, which are found to be reasonably necessary to prevent incompatibility and/or conflicts with other land uses in the immediate vicinity of the proposed Adult Business Establishment.

E.    Conditionally permitted only in the C-1 and C-2 zoning districts. A Conditional Use Permit for an Adult Business Establishment may only be approved within the C-1 and C-2 zoning districts.

A.    Application/Findings. Any property owner or his/her authorized agent may apply to the Planning Commission for a variance from Section 8.44.050, Location Requirements. The Planning Commission, after a public hearing, may issue a variance if the following findings are made:

1.    The Applicant has met the findings required for variances from the Zoning Ordinance pursuant to Chapter 8.112, Variance.

2.    The proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this Title will be observed.

Ord. 3-07 (March 2007)


8.52.040 Density Bonus Calculation.

A.    The amount of the Density Bonus for Housing Developments meeting the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030 shall be calculated as set forth in this Section.

1.    For Housing Developments meeting the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030.C.2.a, the Density Bonus shall be calculated as follows:

	Lower-Income Units %	Density Bonus %

	10	20

	11	21.5

	12	23

	13	24.5

	14	26

	15	27.5

	16	29

	17	30.5

	18	32

	19	33.5

	20	35

2.    For Housing Developments meeting the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030.C.2.b, the Density Bonus shall be calculated as follows:

	Very Low-Income Units %	Density Bonus %

	5	20

	6	22.5

	7	25

	8	27.5

	9	30

	10	32.5

	11	35

3.    For Housing Developments meeting the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030.C.2.c, the Density Bonus shall be 20 percent (20%).

4.    For Housing Developments meeting the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030.C.2.d, the Density Bonus shall be calculated as follows:

	Moderate-Income Units %	Density Bonus %

	10	5

	11	6

	12	7

	13	8

	14	9

	15	10

	16	11

	39	34

	40	35

B.    In determining the percentage of total units in a project for Lower Income Households, units for Very Low Income Households, or units in a common interest development for Persons and Families of Moderate Income, no rounding shall be employed.

1.    EXAMPLE: If a 200 unit project contains 21 lower income units (or 10.5% lower income), the Density Bonus would be calculated based on 10% lower income units and not 11% lower income units. Therefore, the Density Bonus is 20%.

C.    Where density calculations result in fractional units, the fractional unit shall be treated as a unit.

1.    EXAMPLE: Thus, for illustrative purposes, the number of additional units authorized by virtue of a Density Bonus in a 201-unit project containing 22 lower income units (or 11%) would be calculated as follows. The Density Bonus for a project with 11% lower income units is 21.5%. The number of additional units to which the Applicant is entitled by virtue of the Density Bonus would be calculated by multiplying 201 by 0.215 for a product of 43.215. After rounding up pursuant to this subsection C, the Applicant would be allowed an additional 44 units for a total of 245 units. Ord. 3-07 (March 2007)


8.52.050 Concessions or Incentives.

A.    An Applicant for a Housing Development that meets the criteria set forth in Section 8.52.030, upon specific application, shall be entitled to the number of Concessions or Incentives set forth in Section 8.52.050.D, unless the City makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:

2.    The Concession or Incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Health & Safety Code Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to very low‑, lower- and moderate-income households.

B.    A Concession or Incentive granted pursuant to this Section may be any one of the following:

1.    A reduction in the site Development Standards that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions (e.g., coverage, setback, zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes, and/or parking requirements); or

2.    Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land uses would reduce the cost of the housing project, and the nonresidential land uses would be compatible with the housing project and existing or planned development in the area where the proposed Housing Development is located. If approval of mixed-use zoning requires an amendment to the General Plan and/or to a specific plan, the Applicant shall apply for such amendment(s) separately and in compliance with Chapter 8.120, and shall pay all processing and preparation costs associated with such amendment(s); or

3.    Other regulatory Concessions or Incentives proposed by the Applicant or the City that would result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

C.    A project which provides Restricted Units may be entitled to priority processing.

3.    Three Concessions or Incentives for projects that include:

a.    At least 30 percent of the total units for Lower Income Households; or

b.    At least 15 percent for Very Low Income Households; or

c.    At least 30 percent for Persons and Families of Moderate Income in a common interest development.

E.    The Applicant shall submit a project financial report (pro forma) along with the application for the project to allow the City to evaluate: 1) whether the Concessions or Incentives sought pursuant to Sections 8.52.050.B.1 and 8.52.050.B.3 would result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions; or 2) whether the Concessions or Incentives sought pursuant to Section 8.52.050.B.2 would reduce the cost of the housing project. The City may retain a consultant to review the financial report (pro forma). The cost of the consultant shall be borne by the Applicant with the following exception: If the Applicant is a non profit organization, the cost of the consultant may be paid by the City upon prior approval of the City Council.

8.52.070 Certification of Initial Occupants of Restricted Units.

No household shall be permitted to occupy a Restricted Unit unless the City or the City’s designee has approved the household’s eligibility. Potential occupants of Restricted Units will be qualified on the basis of household income, as Lower Income Households, Very Low Income Households, or Persons and Families of Moderate Income, or as persons eligible to occupy a Senior Citizen Housing Development or Restricted Mobilehome Park. The Applicant shall use an equitable selection method established in conformance with the terms of this Chapter. The selection criteria may not distinguish between adults and children. Ord. 3-07 (March 2007)

8.54.040 Preliminary Application Process.

A.    Preliminary Applications. Prospective applicants for Condominium Conversion Permits shall initially submit a preliminary application on forms provided by the City. Preliminary applications shall identify the owner or the owner’s authorized agent and the location and number of units in the building to be converted. The preliminary application shall be accompanied by a preliminary application fee, the amount of which shall be as set forth from time to time by resolution of the City Council.

B.    Department Review. The Community Development Director shall review preliminary applications for condominium conversions. The Community Development Director shall authorize the submittal of a Condominium Conversion Permit application if both of the following criteria are met:

1.    Notice of Intent to Convert Provided. The applicant provides satisfactory evidence to the Community Development Director that the Notice of Intent to Convert required by section 8.54.050 was received by all tenants of the project proposed for conversion and that 60 days have elapsed since the applicant made the last such notification.

2.    Conversion Would Not Exceed Annual Maximum. The approval of the proposal would not result in the conversion of units in excess of the Annual Maximum. The “Annual Maximum” for the purposes of this Chapter shall be equal to seven percent (7%) of the total number of multiple-family units in developments of twenty one (21) or more rental units in the City, as determined by the City as of January 1 of each year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of units in a project proposed for conversion by itself exceeds the Annual Maximum, the Community Development Director shall authorize the submittal of a Condominium Conversion Permit application for the proposed project, unless the Community Development Director has during that year authorized the submittal of a Condominium Conversion Permit application and that authorization has not expired. If the Community Development Director authorizes the submittal of an application to convert a project that exceeds the Annual Maximum, the total number of units in excess of the Annual Maximum shall be subtracted from the Annual Maximum for the next year (and if necessary for each subsequent year).

Preliminary applications for each year may be submitted no earlier than January 1. Preliminary applications shall be processed in the order that completed applications are submitted. If a preliminary application is rejected because it fails to meet the requirements of subdivision B.1 of this Section, the preliminary application may be resubmitted. If the preliminary application is rejected because it fails to meet the requirements of subdivision B.2 of this Section, the preliminary application may not be resubmitted until no sooner than January 1 of year following the preliminary application’s submittal. In either case, the resubmittal will not be entitled to priority over preliminary applications submitted between the original submittal and the resubmittal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, no Condominium Conversion Permit application shall be accepted for projects that propose to convert only a portion of the units in an existing multiple unit residential project.

The Condominium Conversion Permit application shall be submitted no later than 60 days following the Community Development Director’s authorization. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.050 Notice of Intent to Convert.

A.    At least sixty (60) days prior to submitting an application for a Condominium Conversion Permit pursuant to section 8.54.070, the applicant shall provide notice substantially in the form outlined in subdivision B to each tenant in the project proposed for conversion.

B.    The notice shall be substantially as follows:

H.    Such additional information as the Community Development Director deems necessary to ensure the compliance with this Chapter. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.080 Building Code Requirements.

The building proposed for conversion and each unit within the building shall comply with the current Housing Code as defined by section 7.48 of the Dublin Municipal Code. The Building Official shall, if deemed necessary, inspect the project. Upon completion of the inspection, if any, the Building Official shall identify all items evidenced by the application or the inspection to be in noncompliance with applicable building and housing standards. All such items shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Official, prior to granting the Condominium Conversion Permit. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.090 Tenant’s Right to Purchase Units.

A.    All Units. The applicant shall, as a condition of approval of the Condominium Conversion Permit and before offering the unit for sale to the general public, be required to provide tenants with an exclusive right to contract for the purchase of the unit occupied by the tenant upon the same terms and conditions that such unit will be initially offered to the general public or on terms more favorable to the tenant. The right shall run for a period of 90 days from the date of issuance of the subdivision public report pursuant to section 11018 of the Business and Professions Code, unless the tenant gives prior written notice of his or her intention not to exercise the right. At least ten days prior to the submission of an application to the Department of Real Estate for a public report, the applicant shall provide notice to each tenant in the project of the fact that the application for a public report will be submitted and that upon the issuance of the public report the tenant will be granted an exclusive right to contract for the purchase of the unit occupied by the tenant upon the same terms and conditions that such unit will be initially offered to the general public or on terms more favorable to the tenant. The notice shall further indicate the project will be subject to conditions, covenants, and restrictions that establish a homeowners’ association to manage the project, that may restrict how the property is used, and that impose certain financial obligations on the owners of units within the project, such as the payment of monthly homeowners’ association dues. In addition, within 10 days of the issuance of the public report, the applicant shall by mail notify each tenant in writing that the public report has been issued and shall in writing grant the tenant the right to purchase the unit as provided in this section. If the notice is not mailed within 10 days of the issuance of the public report, the tenant’s right to purchase granted pursuant to this section shall be extended for a period equal to 80 days from mailing of the notification.

B.    Affordable Units. If a tenant occupies an inclusionary unit pursuant to the City’s inclusionary zoning program, all of the provisions of Subsection A shall apply except as otherwise provided in this Subsection B. The applicant shall initially determine the income category (i.e. very low, low, or moderate income) under Section 8.68.030 at which the inclusionary unit is being rented to the tenant. The applicant shall thereupon offer the unit to the tenant at the sales price that a unit in the unit’s income category could be sold under Chapter 8.68, subject to the City’s certification of the tenant’s qualifications to purchase the unit. Should the City determine that the tenant’s household income is such that the tenant does not qualify to purchase the unit within the income category at which it is offered, the applicant shall:

1.    Offer the unit to the tenant pursuant to Subsection A. If the tenant accepts the offer, the applicant shall convert a unit within the project not previously designated as an inclusionary unit to an inclusionary unit in the income category of the unit purchased by the tenant. The number of bedrooms in the converted unit shall be equal to or greater than the number of bedrooms in the unit purchased by the tenant.

2.    If the City determines that the tenant’s household income is such that it meets one of the other income categories set forth in Section 8.68.020.D (i.e. very low, low, and moderate incomes), and provided that there are available inclusionary units within the project at that income category, offer the unit to the tenant at a sales price that a unit in the tenant’s income category could be sold under Chapter 8.68, subject to the City’s certification of the tenant’s qualifications to purchase the unit. If the tenant accepts the offer, the available unit shall be designated as an inclusionary unit at the income category at which the unit purchased by the tenant was previously rented. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.100 Limitations on Rent Increases Pending Conversion.

Rents shall not be increased from the date of issuance of the Notice of Intent to Convert pursuant to Section 8.54.050 until twelve months following the approval of the Condominium Conversion Permit or six months following the issuance of a public report by the Real Estate Commissioner pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 11018, whichever occurs later. If the applicant withdraws an application for a Condominium Conversion Permit, this section shall have no further effect. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.110 Tenant Protections.

A.    Requirement. The applicant shall, as a condition of approval of the Condominium Conversion Permit, be required to implement the Tenant Relocation Assistance Plan that is approved by the City in conjunction with the issuance of the Condominium Conversion Permit. The Tenant Relocation Assistance Plan shall be prepared by the applicant and shall indicate the applicant’s commitment to provide the tenant benefits required by this section.

B.    Eligible Tenant. As used in this section, the term “Eligible Tenant” means any tenant that has a disability as defined in Section 54 of the California Civil Code, that was a resident of the property both on the date of the filing of the application for a Condominium Conversion Permit and on the date of approval of the permit, and that does not intend to purchase a unit in the conversion project.

C.    Notice of Termination of Tenancy. Each tenant of a project proposed for conversion shall be given 365 days’ written notice of intention to terminate tenancy due to the conversion. The notice shall indicate that the tenant may terminate his or her tenancy upon 30 days’ notice. The notice shall also provide the tenant with a summary description of the City-approved Tenant Relocation Assistance Plan and information on where to obtain a copy. The notice shall also indicate that the tenant will be granted a right to purchase the unit the tenant occupies. Each person who becomes a tenant of a conversion project after the date of such 365 days’ written notice shall be given a copy of the notice of intention to terminate tenancy before entering into any written or oral rental agreement but shall not be entitled to 365 days’ written notice prior to termination of tenancy due to the conversion.

D.    Financial Relocation Assistance. The Plan shall include a provision that requires the applicant to provide financial assistance equal to the rent for the three-month period prior to the filing of the application for the Condominium Conversion Permit to any Eligible Tenant that relocates after the issuance of the Condominium Conversion Permit. The financial assistance payment shall be made 30 days prior to the termination of the Eligible Tenant’s tenancy, if the Eligible Tenant provides notice to the applicant of the Eligible Tenant’s termination of the lease, or 30 days prior to the expiration of 365-day Notice of Termination of Tenancy period, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding Subsection B of this Section, a tenant shall be deemed an Eligible Tenant and eligible for the financial assistance payment if the Condominium Conversion Permit has not yet been granted but 335 days have elapsed since the tenant was provided a Notice of Termination of Tenancy. A tenant is not entitled to financial assistance pursuant to this subsection if the tenant has been evicted for just cause or has not made rental payments to which the applicant is legally entitled. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.120 Notification of New Tenants.

All prospective tenants of a project for which a Notice of Intent to Convert has been issued to tenants pursuant to section 8.54.050 shall be provided with a copy of the Notice of Intent to Convert prior to their execution of a lease. If provided with such notice, prospective tenants shall not be entitled to tenant relocation assistance provided to Eligible Tenants pursuant to section 8.54.110. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.130 Compliance with Inclusionary Zoning Regulations.

Condominium conversions shall be treated as “new residential development projects” under and shall be required to comply with the then-current Inclusionary Zoning Regulations in Chapter 8.68. The decision maker shall include conditions in the Condominium Conversion Permit approval sufficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of Chapter 8.68. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the project was required to comply with the Inclusionary Zoning Regulations at the time the project was constructed, the project shall receive a credit for the number of affordable units required at the time the project was constructed. Any existing affordable units within the project created pursuant to the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Regulations shall remain affordable units. If fees were paid in lieu of creating affordable units, the credit may only be used to satisfy that portion of the obligation under the then-current Inclusionary Zoning Regulations that may be satisfied by payment of fees in lieu of creation of affordable units.

By way of illustration, if at the time a 40-unit rental project was constructed, the Inclusionary Zoning Regulations required 5% of the units in the project to be affordable, and the developer paid fees in lieu of constructing one affordable unit and built a moderate-income affordable unit to meet the project’s obligations under the Inclusionary Zoning Regulations, then, upon the event of a conversion of the 40-unit project, the converter would be entitled to a two-unit credit against its Inclusionary Zoning obligations. Thus, if the then-current Inclusionary Zoning Regulations require that 12.5% of the units be affordable and provide that at least 7.5% of the units must be constructed, then the converter’s Inclusionary Zoning Obligation would be 3 units, which is 5 units minus the two-unit credit. One unit of credit would be associated with the moderate-income affordable unit that would remain affordable. As the other unit of credit was created by the payment of in-lieu fees and is equal to 2.5% of the total units in the project, only one unit of the remaining inclusionary obligation of 3 units could be satisfied through the payment of in-lieu fees. Pursuant to the income-level allocations and rounding conventions set forth in section 8.68.030.B, the project’s 3 affordable units are required to be distributed to the three income categories as follows: 1 moderate-income unit, 1 low-income unit, and 1 very low-income unit. Since the existing unit is a moderate-income unit, the two additional affordable units would have to be provided in the very low- and low-income categories. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.140 Development Standards - Utilities.

A.    Gas. Each condominium unit shall have a separate gas service where gas is a necessary utility. If this provision places unreasonable economic burden on the applicant, the Building Official may approve an alternative method.

B.    Electricity. Each condominium unit shall have a separate electrical service, with separate meters and disconnects.

C.    Telephone Company Access. The telephone company serving the location under conversion shall have the right to construct and maintain (place, operate, inspect, repair, replace, and remove) communication facilities as it may from time-to-time require (including access) in or upon any portion of the common area, including the interior and exterior of the buildings as necessary to maintain communication service within the project. This provision may not be amended or terminated without the consent of the serving telephone company. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.150 Findings Required for Approval.

The decision maker shall not approve a Condominium Conversion Permit unless it finds:

A.    That the proposed conversion is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plans, in particular with the objectives, policies, and programs of the Housing Element of the General Plan designed to provide for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.

B.    That the proposed conversion, as conditioned, conforms to the requirements of this Chapter.

C.    That the approval would not result in the conversion of units in excess of the Annual Maximum, as defined in section 8.54.040. The Annual Maximum shall be based on the year in which the Community Development Director authorized the filing of a Condominium Conversion Permit application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of units in a project proposed for conversion by itself exceeds the Annual Maximum, the decision maker shall not refuse to approve application because it would result in the conversion of units in excess of the Annual Maximum. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.160 Term and Lapse of Condominium Conversion Permit.

A Condominium Conversion Permit shall lapse 1 year following the date on which the permit became effective, if the applicant has not yet received a subdivision public report from the Real Estate Commissioner pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 11018 authorizing the sale of the units proposed for conversion to the public. The permit shall be extended for a period of not more than one year, if the Community Development Director finds that the applicant is diligently pursuing but has not yet received a subdivision public report from the Real Estate Commissioner pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 11018 authorizing the sale of the units proposed for conversion to the public. Upon receipt of the subdivision public report from the Real Estate Commissioner authorizing the sale of the units proposed for conversion to the public, the Condominium Conversion Permit shall be automatically extended so long as the subdivision public report remains in effect. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.170 Action.

The decision maker for Condominium Conversion Permits shall be the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, and after the public hearing is closed may, by resolution and based on evidence in the public record and the findings above approve, conditionally approve, or deny a Condominium Conversion Permit. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)


8.54.180 Adjustments and Waivers.

A.    Authority to Waive or Adjust Requirements. The requirements of this Chapter may be adjusted or waived if the property owner demonstrates to the City Manager that applying the requirements of this Chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California Constitutions. A person seeking an adjustment or waiver shall apply to the City Manager and provide such information as the City Manager finds is necessary to determine whether applying the requirements of this Chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California Constitutions.

B.    Consideration and Decision. In making a determination on an application to adjust or waive the requirements of this Chapter, the City Manager shall consider all relevant evidence submitted by the applicant. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that applying the requirements of this Chapter would take property in violation of the United States of California Constitutions. The City Manager, upon legal advice provided by the City Attorney, will make a determination on the application and issue a written decision. The City Manager’s decision shall be final.

C.    Adjustment or Waiver of Requirements. If the City Manager, upon legal advice provided by the City Attorney, determines that the application of the provisions of this Chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California Constitutions, the requirements of this Chapter shall be modified, adjusted or waived to reduce the obligations under this Chapter to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result. If the City Manager determines no violation of the United States or California Constitutions would occur through application of this Chapter, the requirements of this Chapter remain applicable. Ord. 11-05 (May 2005)

8.60.060 Facility Siting Criteria and Permitting Requirements.

The following siting criteria and permitting requirements have been established for use by hazardous waste facility project proponents in locating and designing suitable facility sites and appropriate facilities, and by the City in evaluating proposed sites and facility projects. The purpose of the criteria is to reduce public health and environmental risks and governmental costs associated with development of off-site hazardous waste facilities.

A.    Protect the Residents of Alameda County (and the City of Dublin):

1.    Distance from residentially designated property

All Facilities: Treatment, storage, or transfer facilities handling ignitable, explosive, reactive or acutely hazardous wastes must provide a minimum buffer zone of at least 2,000 feet between the nearest residential designated property and the facility site, unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the public in the event of an accident. For other facilities, including recycling, transfer, or storage of other types of hazardous wastes, a buffer zone of at least 500 feet is required between the operational area within the facility site and the nearest residential designated property (again, unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the public in the event of an accident).

2.    Distance from Immobile populations:

All Facilities: Facilities shall comply with City minimum zoning code setbacks, unless a greater buffer distance from other uses is deemed necessary, based on a required health and safety assessment. Larger buffer zones are required between a transfer station, storage, or treatment facility, and any immobile populations where evacuation in the event of an accident at the facility is likely to be difficult or inadvisable. This is especially true for facilities handling ignitable, explosive, or reactive waste. A minimum buffer zone of 5,000 feet between a facility site and any site with an immobile population is therefore required, unless the developer can demonstrate by risk assessment and as part of the local permitting process that a smaller buffer zone provides adequate protection for the immobile population.

B.    Ensure the Structural Stability of the Facility:

1.    Floodplains:

All facilities: Facilities must be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to preclude failure due to flooding, per flood control authorities and requirements. Provisions must be made to contain and test storm runoff prior to discharge in areas subject to contamination by waste or treated material. The required health and safety assessment will address flooding risks associated with the facility. Facilities may be located in areas subject to 100-year flooding only if protected by offsetting engineered improvements, such as berms or raising the facility above flood levels. This includes areas subject to flooding by dam or levee failure and natural causes such as river flooding, flash floods, rainfall or snowmelt, tsunamis (tidal waves), seiches (earthquake-induced waves in lakes), and coastal flooding. A structural analysis or engineering design study must be provided which shows methods to prevent undulation or washout.

2.    Seismic:

All Facilities: Facilities must have a minimum 200-foot setback from active or recently active earthquake faults, per the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 6391(a)(f11)A(1) and (2). The required health and safety assessment will address earthquake safety of the facility.

3.    Unstable soils:

All Facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating in areas of potential rapid geologic change, unless the facility and its containment structures have engineered design features to assure structural stability. This includes areas with unstable soils, steep slopes, and areas subject to liquefaction, subsidence or other severe geologic constraints. The required health and safety assessment will include a geologic report defining any such constraints and engineered solutions.

C.    Protect Water Quality:

1.    Groundwater:

All Facilities: Facilities shall be fully enclosed by containment structures of impermeable materials which would contain any unauthorized release of hazardous material. Facilities shall be equipped with leak detection and spill control and recovery capability.

Facilities are encouraged to locate outside of known or suspected principal recharge areas to regional aquifers as defined in local or state plans and areas of permeable strata and soils as defined by the Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. Facilities may locate in these areas only with increased engineered design features such as horizontal and vertical containment and monitoring systems to ensure protection. Subsurface storage or treatment facilities must provide secondary containment and shall be sited, designed and operated to ensure that hazardous materials will always be twenty feet above the tension-saturated zone unless approved by the Alameda County Water District.

Facilities are also encouraged to locate outside of areas where groundwater is within twenty feet of the natural land surface. Facilities may locate in these areas only with increased engineered design features such as horizontal and vertical containment and monitoring systems to ensure protection. Subsurface storage or treatment operation is prohibited.

Industrial Transfer/Storage/Treatment Facility: Groundwater monitoring wells must be located around each facility to determine background vadose zone and groundwater quality, and to detect leaks and spills from the facility, unless demonstrated to be safe without them through the health and safety assessment. An ongoing groundwater monitoring program should be developed in consultation with local, state and water district representatives.

2.    Surface Water quality

All facilities: Developers shall comply with the requirements of the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program.

3.    Wastewater:

All facilities: Facilities operating wastewater should locate in areas with adequate industrial sewer capacity. The quality of wastewater must meet all federal, state and local sewering agency discharge requirements; and the facility must obtain a valid industrial wastewater discharge permit.

D.    Protect Air Quality:

1.    Air quality nonattainment and PSD areas:

All facilities: Facilities may be sited in nonattainment and PSD (prevention of significant deterioration) areas only if they meet the requirements of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The required health and safety assessment will identify air emissions, impacts and mitigation associated with the facility.

E.    Protect Environmentally Sensitive Areas:

1.    Wetlands

All facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating in wetlands such as salt water, fresh water and brackish marshes, swamps and bogs, as defined in local regional and state plans and policies (generally, areas inundated by surface water or ground water with a frequency to support, under normal circumstances, a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life which requires saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction).

2.    Habitat of Endangered Species

All facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating within critical habitats of endangered species, defined as areas known to be inhabited permanently or seasonally or known to be critical at any stage in the life cycle of any species of wildlife or vegetation identified or being considered for identification as “endangered” or “threatened” by the U.S. Department of Interior of the State of California.

3.    Prime agricultural lands:

All facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating on prime agricultural lands, as defined in California law and local plans, unless an overriding public need is served and demonstrated.

4.    Recreational, cultural and aesthetic resources:

Small-Scale Transfer and Storage facilities: Low-volume transfer and storage facilities may locate in protected, recreational, cultural or aesthetic resource areas, as defined by local, regional, state of national plans or policies, only if necessary to handle hazardous wastes generated by workers, residents, or visitors in these areas.

Industrial Transfer/Storage/Treatment Facility: Facilities are prohibited from locating in protected recreational, cultural and aesthetic resource areas, as defined by local, regional, state or national plans or policies.

5.    Military lands:

All facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating on military lands by the policy of the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD).

6.    Mineral resource areas:

All facilities: Facilities are prohibited from locating on lands containing significant mineral deposits, as classified by local plans or California’s mineral land class maps and reports, if the extraction of the mineral deposit would be precluded.

F.    Ensure Safe Transportation of Hazardous Waste:

1.    Proximity to waste generation areas:

All facilities: Facilities shall locate in the M-1 (Light Industrial) and M-2 (Heavy Industrial) zoning districts at locations close to sources of hazardous waste generation to minimize the risks of transportation.

2.    Proximity and Access to Major Routes:

All facilities: Facilities shall locate to minimize distance from major transportation routes. Facilities must have good access by roads designed to accommodate heavy vehicles. Travel routes from facilities to major transportation routes shall be on industrial streets, accessible to designated truck routes, not pass through residential neighborhoods, shall minimize residential frontages, and shall be demonstrated as safe with regard to road design and construction, accident rates, excessive traffic, etc. The required health and safety assessment will evaluate risks associated with transportation of hazardous wastes.

G.    Protect the Social and Economic Goals of the Community:

1.    Consistency with the General Plan, applicable Specific Plans and zoning:

All facilities: Facilities must be consistent with local planning policies, including the City General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.

2.    Fiscal impact:

All facilities: A facility’s fiscal impact to the City must be demonstrated.

3.    Socioeconomic impacts:

All facilities: The City may require the facility developer to fund an independent study on socioeconomic impacts of the facility.

4.    Proximity to Public Services:

All facilities: Facilities shall be served by necessary public services including but not necessarily limited to sewer, water, electricity, gas and telephone. The site shall be located within a three minute response time from the nearest fire station.

5.    Consistency with Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Plan:

All facilities: Facilities shall be consistent with the goals and policies of the Alameda County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, and must demonstrate compliance with the siting criteria established herein. Facilities shall be consistent with the fair share principal, and with any interjurisdictional agreements on hazardous waste management. Local needs are to be the primary basis for facility siting criteria decisions, along with regional commitments; facilities are to be designed and sized primarily to meet the hazardous waste management needs of Alameda County, or to meet the county’s broader regional commitments under an interjurisdictional agreement.


8.60.070 Special Development Requirements.

A.    General Conditions:

The City may impose conditions on the granting of a Conditional Use Permit for a hazardous waste facility in order to achieve the purposes of this section and the General Plan and to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community.

B.    Safety and Security:

1.    The owner or operator shall prevent the unknowing entry, and minimize the possibility for the unauthorized entry, of persons or livestock onto any portion of the facility.

2.    The operator shall provide a twenty-four hour surveillance system (e.g., elevation monitoring or surveillance by guards or facility personnel which continuously monitors and controls entry onto the facility.

3.    An artificial or natural barrier (e.g., a wall or a wall combined with a landscaped berm) shall be constructed to completely surround the facility.

4.    All gates or other entrances into the facility shall be provided with adequate means to control entry at all times.

8.68.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to:

A.    enhance the public welfare and assure that further housing development contributes to the attainment of the City’s housing goals by increasing the production of residential units affordable by households of very low, low, and moderate income.

B.    assure that the limited remaining developable land in the City’s planning area is utilized in a manner consistent with the City’s housing policies and needs. Rev. Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)


8.68.020 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, each of the following terms shall be defined as follows:

A.    “Affordable unit” means an ownership or rental-housing unit, including senior housing, affordable to households with very-low, low, or moderate incomes as defined in this Chapter.

1.    Rental units are deemed affordable units if the annual rent does not exceed 30% of maximum income level for low- and moderate-income households, adjusted for household size and as defined below.

2.    Owner-occupied units are deemed affordable units if the sales price results in annual housing expenses that do not exceed 35% of the maximum income level for very-low-, low-, and moderate-income households, adjusted for household size and as defined below.

B.    “Applicant” means any person, firm, partnership, association, joint venture, corporation, or any entity or combination of entities that seeks city real property development permits or approvals.

C.    “Dwelling unit” means a dwelling designed and intended for occupancy by one household.

D.    “Very-low-, low-, and moderate-income levels” means those income and eligibility levels determined periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development based on Alameda County median income levels adjusted for family size. Such levels shall be calculated on the basis of gross annual household income considering household size and number of dependents, income of all wage earners, elderly or disabled family members, and all other sources of household income and will be recertified as set forth by local standards, and state and federal housing law.

1.    “Very-low income” means 50% or less of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

2.    “Low income” means more than 50% to 80% of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

3.    “Moderate income” means more than 80% to 120% of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

With respect to rental units, such rent restrictions shall be in the form of a regulatory agreement recorded against the applicable property. With respect to owner-occupied units, such resale controls shall be in the form of resale restrictions, deeds of trust, and/or other similar documents recorded against the applicable property.

F.    “Residential development” includes, without limitation, detached single-family dwellings, multiple-dwelling structures, groups of dwellings, condominium or townhouse developments, condominium conversions, cooperative developments, mixed use developments that include housing units, and residential land subdivisions intended to be sold to the general public. Rev. Ord. 43-08 (December 2008); Ord. 8-05 (March 2005); Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)


8.68.030 General Requirements

A.    12.5% Affordability Requirement. All new residential development projects of 20 units or more designed and intended for permanent occupancy shall construct 12.5% of the total number of dwelling units within the development as affordable units, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. The foregoing requirement shall be applied no more than once to an approved development (and generally at the tentative map stage), regardless of the changes in the character or ownership of the development, provided the total number of units does not change. In applying and calculating the affordability requirement, any decimal fraction less than or equal to 0.50 may be disregarded, and any decimal fraction greater than 0.50 shall be construed as one unit.

B.    Allocation of Units to Income Levels. Affordable units provided pursuant to this section shall be allocated to households with very-low, low-, and moderate-income levels as follows:

	Rental Units	Owner-Occupied Units

	Very-low-income households	30%	0%

	Low-income households	20%	40%

	Moderate-income households	50%	60%

Where the calculation of the allocation results in fewer units than would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection A of this section, one additional unit should be allocated to the income level with a decimal fraction closest to 0.50.

C.    Conditions of Approval: Any tentative map, conditional use permit, or site development review approving residential development projects subject to this chapter shall contain conditions sufficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Such conditions shall detail the number of affordable units required, specify the schedule of construction of affordable units, set forth the applicant’s manner of compliance with this chapter, and require the execution of an agreement imposing appropriate resale controls and/or rental restrictions on the affordable units.

D.    Concurrent Construction. All affordable units in a project or phase of a project shall be constructed concurrently with market-rate units, unless the City Manager determines in writing that extenuating circumstances exist that make concurrent construction infeasible or impractical.

E.    Design and Distribution of Affordable Units. All affordable units shall reflect the range of numbers of bedrooms provided in the project as a whole and shall not be distinguished by exterior design, construction, or materials. Affordable units may be of smaller size than the units in the project and may have fewer amenities than the market rate units in the project. All affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the project. Rev. Ord. 43-08 (December 2008); Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)


8.68.040 Exceptions to 12.5% Affordability Requirement.

Developers of projects subject to 8.68.030A shall construct 12.5% of the total number of dwelling units within the development as affordable units, unless subject to an exception set forth in this section. All exceptions require City Council approval, which shall be obtained at or prior to the last discretionary approval for the project.

A.    Payment of Fees In Lieu of Creation of Affordable Units. Upon request of the applicant, the City Council shall permit the applicant to pay a fee in lieu of constructing up to 40% of the affordable units that the developer would otherwise be required to construct pursuant to Section 8.68.030A. The amount of the fee shall be as set forth in a resolution of the City Council, which may be amended from time to time to reflect inflation and changed conditions in the City and the region. In lieu fees shall be paid at the time and in the amount set forth in the in lieu fee resolution in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit.

B.    Off-Site Projects. An applicant may construct the affordable units not physically within the development in lieu of constructing some or all of the affordable units within the development, with the approval of the City Council, if the City Council finds:

1.    that construction of the units off-site in lieu of constructing units on-site is consistent with the chapter’s goal of creating, preserving, maintaining, and protecting housing for very low-, low- and moderate-income households.

2.    that the units to be constructed off site are consistent with Section 8.68.030E above.

3.    that it would be infeasible or impractical to construct affordable units on-site.

4.    that conditions of approval for the project require that the off-site affordable units would be governed by the terms of a deed restriction and, if applicable, rental restrictions similar to that used for the on-site affordable units.

5.    that the conditions of approval for the project, or other security such as a cash deposit, bond, or letter of credit, are adequate to require the construction of the off-site affordable units concurrently with the completion of the construction of the residential development or within a reasonable period (not to exceed 5 years).

C.    Land Dedication. An applicant may dedicate land to the City or city-designated local non-profit housing developer in lieu of construction of some or all of the required affordable units, if the Council finds that:

1.    that dedication of land in lieu of constructing units is consistent with the chapter’s goal of creating, preserving, maintaining, and protecting housing for very-low, low- and moderate-income households.

2.    that the dedicated land is useable for its intended purpose, is free of toxic substances and contaminated soils, and is fully improved, with infrastructure, adjacent utilities, grading, and all development-impact fees paid excluding any inclusionary zoning ordinance fees.

3.    that the proposed land dedication is of sufficient size to meet the following requirements:

a.    the dedication includes land sufficient to construct the number of units that the applicant would otherwise be required to construct by Section 8.68.030.A, based on the size of lots in the subdivision for which the applicant is meeting its obligation; and

b.    in addition, the dedication includes such additional land the market value for which is equal to or exceeds the difference between the value of a market-rate, 1200-square foot unit and the price at which such a unit could be sold as an Affordable Unit (which amount shall be set forth in a resolution adopted from time to time by the City Council) times the number of units required.

D.    Credit transfers. An applicant may fully or partially satisfy the requirements of Section 8.68.030A through the use of transfer credits created pursuant to Section 8.68.060. Credit certificates shall be presented to the Community Development Director, who shall note at the time of project approval the credit certificate by number. Credit certificates may only be used to satisfy the requirements for Inclusionary Units for the income category (i.e., very low, low, or moderate) and number of bedrooms for which they are issued.

E.    Waiver of Requirements. The City Council, at its discretion, may waive, wholly or partially, the requirements of this ordinance and approve alternate methods of compliance with this Chapter if the applicant demonstrates, and the City Council finds, that such alternate methods meet the purposes of this Chapter. Rev. Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)


8.68.050 General Procedures for Implementing Inclusionary Zoning Requirements

A.    Agreements. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for an affordable unit, resale restrictions or rental controls, or both, as the case may be, shall be set forth in an agreement between the City and the developer, in a form consistent with the City Council-adopted form agreement, which agreement shall be recorded against the property containing the affordable units. The agreement shall be executed by the City Manager, and its requirements shall run with the land and bind the applicant’s successors.

B.    Rental Units; Occupancy; Annual Report. Agreements involving rental units shall require the owner of the affordable units to ensure that the units are occupied by tenants whose monthly income levels do not exceed very low-, low-, or moderate income levels, as the case may be, and shall preclude tenants from subletting or subleasing the unit. The agreement shall also require the owner of the affordable unit to submit an annual report to the City Manager, in a format approved by the City. The report shall include, but not be limited to the following information: an identification of the affordable units within the project; the monthly rents charged and proposed to be charged; vacancy information for the prior year; and the monthly income for tenants of each affordable unit throughout the prior year.

C.    Ownership Units; Occupancy; City’s Right of First Refusal. Agreements for ownership units shall specify that the inclusionary units must be occupied by the owner or owners and may not be leased or rented without the written approval of the City. The resale restrictions shall provide that in the event of the sale of an affordable unit, the City shall have the right to purchase any affordable owner-occupant unit at the maximum price that could be charged to an eligible household.

D.    Selection Criteria. No household shall be permitted to occupy a unit that is required under this chapter to be affordable unless the City or its designee has approved the household’s eligibility. Eligible potential occupants of affordable units will be qualified on the basis of household income, the median combined household income statistics for Alameda County published periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, all sources of household income and assets, the relationship between household size and the size of available units, and any further criteria required by law. The developer shall use an equitable selection method established in conformance with the terms of this chapter. The selection criteria may not distinguish between adults and children. Selection of qualified person should be based on priorities established using the point system described below:

•    Employed within the boundaries of the City of Dublin (3 points, one per household)

•    Public Service employee working in the City of Dublin (1 additional point)

•    Dublin resident (3 points, one per household)

•    Seniors (1 point, one per household)

•    Permanently disabled (1 point, one per household)

•    Immediate family member of Dublin resident (1 point, one per household)

•    Required to relocate from current Dublin residence due to demolition of dwelling or conversion of dwelling from rental to for-sale unit (1 point, one per household)

To qualify as a “Public Service Employee”, the person shall be employed by a Public Agency.

To qualify as “Employed within the boundaries of the City of Dublin”, the person shall have been employed within the City of Dublin for at least six months.

To qualify as a “Dublin resident,” the person shall have been a resident of the City of Dublin for at least a one-year period prior to the eligibility determination. Rev. Ord. 8-05 (March 2005); Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)

The certificate shall designate a specific income category (i.e., very-low, low, or moderate income) and number of bedrooms for which they are issued.

B.    Ownership and use of credits. Affordable unit credit certificates are issued to and become the possession of the project owner, who may then use them to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for another project in the City. If a project owner proposes to sell credit certificates, the parties shall first obtain the consent of the Community Development Director, who will document the transfer by certificate number. Rev. Ord. 1-03 (January 2003); Ord. 8-02 (May 2002)


8.68.070 Incentives to Encourage On-Site Construction of Affordable Units.

The City may, but shall not be required to, offer incentives or financial assistance to encourage the on-site construction of affordable units in excess of 12.5% of the total number of units in the project to the extent resources for this purpose are available and approved for such use by the City Council or City Manager. Such incentives may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

A.    Fee Deferral.

1.    Development Processing Fees. The City Manager may approve deferred payment of City processing fees applicable to the review and processing of the project. The terms and payment schedule of the deferred fees shall be subject to the approval of the City Manager.

Existing mature Bay, Cypress, Maple, Oak, Redwood, and Sycamore trees shall be preserved in non-residential zoning districts if they are over 24 inches in diameter measured 4 feet 6 inches above natural grade. However, trees meeting the above criteria may be removed on a limited basis with the permission of the Director upon submittal of an Arborist’s report which determines that the tree is in poor health and not likely to survive; if the trees constitute a high fire hazard or a threat to persons, structures, or property; or, if they impede public works projects. Trees to be removed shall be shown on the Final Landscaping and Irrigation Plan and detailed on a tree inventory chart on that plan.

5.    Group Plantings. Tree and shrub plantings should be grouped together in order to create strong unified character.

6.    Groundcover. Groundcover shall be spaced to achieve 100% coverage within three years.

7.    Harmony. Landscape designs shall be in harmony with the surrounding environment.

8.    Inorganic Groundcover or Bark. When inorganic groundcover or bark is used, it shall be in combination with live plants and shall be limited to an accent feature or mulch.

9.    Installation. Trees shall be installed in conformity with City of Dublin Standard Plans.

10.    Irrigation System. All commercial, industrial, and multi-family landscaping shall have an automatic irrigation system.

11.    Landscape Architect. Landscaping Plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect registered to practice in the State of California for all projects proposing 5,000 square feet or more of landscaping, unless waived by the Director of Community Development.

12.    Landscaped Building Edges. An attractive landscape edge should be established at the base of buildings. Avoid paved edges at the base of structures as much as possible.

13.    Landscaping Required. Landscaping shall be installed pursuant to this Chapter for all single family residences between the public right-of-way and the residence and for all multi-family, commercial, industrial and public developments.

14.    Maturity. Landscaping should be sized so that it has a mature appearance and fills in its location on the plan within six years of planting.

15.    Mow Strips. Concrete mow strips are required to separate all turf areas from other landscaped areas for all non-residential developments.

16.    Overall Design. Landscaping and open spaces shall be designed as an integral part of the overall site plan design. Landscaping and open spaces shall enhance the building design, enhance public views and spaces, provide buffers and transitions, and provide screening.

17.    Property Rights of Adjacent Property Owners. Trees and shrubs should be planted so that at maturity they do not damage adjacent property, block views of or sunlight to adjacent property owners, or otherwise limit the use of their property.

18.    Service Lines. Trees and shrubs shall be planted so that at maturity they do not interfere with service lines, aqueducts, or conduits.

19.    Signage Visibility. Trees shall be planted so that at maturity they provide visual access to signage in commercially zoned areas. This can be accomplished by planting to provide “view corridors”, by using low-growing trees, trees with high canopies, or trees with more transparent canopies.

20.    Size Of Plant Materials. The sizes of plant materials selected shall be limited to those which have the best chance of survival for a minimum of three years. The use of specimen trees is encouraged in certain situations when the survival of that tree can be assured.

21.    Streetscape Planting. Streetscape planting shall occur along all freeways and six lane and eight lane arterials in order to define and separate development projects. Streetscape planting shall be compatible with that of nearby development projects. This landscaping shall be compatible with screening requirements set forth in Section 8.72.030.B, Screening Requirements, and in Section 8.76.070.A.19, and 8.76.070.B.6, Off-Street Parking and Loading Standards.

22.    Street Tree Species. Street tree species shall conform with City of Dublin Standard Plans.

23.    Survival. All trees installed shall survive for a minimum of one year and all shrubs installed shall survive for a minimum of three years from the date of final approval of the building permit of the last unit of a development. All dead plants shall be replaced with like species during those intervals.

24.    Traffic Visibility Area. No fence, wall, hedge, sign or other structure, shrubbery, mounds of earth, or other visual obstruction over 30 inches in height above the nearest street curb elevation shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow within a Traffic Visibility Area. The foregoing provision shall not apply to public utility poles; trees trimmed (to the trunk) to a line at least 6 feet above the level of the intersection; saplings or plant species of open growth habits and not planted in the form of a hedge, which are so planted and trimmed as to leave at all seasons a clear and unobstructed crossview; supporting members of appurtenances to permanent structures existing on the date this Chapter becomes effective; and official warning signs or signals.

25.    Tree Damage To Improvements. Trees planted near sidewalks, bicycle paths, curbs, gutters, and similar improvements shall be of a species and installed in a manner (such as with root guards or root barriers) which prevents physical damage to those improvements.

26.    Tree Standards. Trees planted in the public right-of-way should be long-lived (minimum life expectancy of 60 years), clean, require little maintenance, be structurally strong, insect and disease resistant, and require little pruning.

27.    Utility Areas. Utility areas shall be screened from roadways and walkways with landscaping.

28.    Wall Plantings. Walls 6 feet or higher shall be planted with vines and shrubs to provide shadow and patterns, and to discourage graffiti. Trellises are encouraged.

29.    Walkways. A system of walkways independent of driveways shall provide safe pedestrian access from public rights-of-way to every dwelling unit and to all commonly used open spaces. Walkways shall have a minimum width of 4 feet.

B.    Screening Requirements.

1.    Requirement. Every new development shall provide sufficient screening along side and rear lot lines so that neighboring properties are effectively shielded from any adverse visual impacts of that development or so that the new developing use shields itself from existing potential visual impacts from uses already in operation.

2.    Screening Requirements Table. Table 72-1 sets forth the type of screening method required between various uses in order to provide a mechanism to buffer potential negative visual impacts. To determine the type of screening required (Type A, B, or C), find the use in the “Developing Use” column which is similar to the proposed use to be developed and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the type of use(s) that adjoins the property to be developed. For each intersecting square that contains a letter, the developer is required to install the level of screening indicated.

3.    Types Of Screening. The three basic types of screens that are required by Table 72-1 are as follows:

a.    Opaque Screen, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstruction (trees or large plants) from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, or densely planted vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. Suggested planting patterns are shown in Figure 72-1.

b.    Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of 3 feet, with intermittent visual obstruction (trees or large plants) from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, or planted vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 15 feet wide. Suggested planting patterns are shown in Figure 72-1.

c.    Broken Screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns are shown in Figure 72-1.

d.    Interpretation. The screening requirements set forth in this section may be interpreted with some flexibility by the Director of Community Development in the enforcement of standards. It is recognized that because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements. Therefore, minor deviations may be granted to allow less intensive screening, or requirements for more intensive screening may be imposed, whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the intent of this Section.

4.    Separation of Zoning Districts. Where the side or rear yard of a use in a commercial or industrial zoning district abuts a residential zoning district, those side or rear yards shall be screened from uses in that residential zoning district with an Opaque Screen, Type A.

5.    Separation of Non-Conforming Uses. whenever a residential lot is occupied by a non-conforming commercial or industrial use, the side and rear yards shall be screened with an Opaque Screen, Type A.

Chapter 8.76 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS


8.76.010 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose and intent of the requirements for off-street parking established by this Chapter are to minimize traffic congestion and hazards to motorists and pedestrians, to provide safe, attractive, and convenient off-street parking facilities with vehicular access to all land uses, to provide off-street parking in proportion to the needs generated by varying land uses, to ensure access to projects by emergency response vehicles, and to ensure that parking areas are compatible with the surrounding land uses.


8.76.020 Applicability.

Every use hereafter commenced, every private parking facility or garage, and every building or structure hereafter erected or altered, shall have permanently maintained off-street parking facilities and vehicular loading spaces, as required by the provisions of this Chapter. These regulations do not apply to parking garages and facilities of governmental agencies. Rev. Ord. 28-99 (12/21/99)


8.76.030 Maintenance.

It shall be unlawful for any person, owning, leasing or controlling a building or structure to fail, neglect or refuse to provide and maintain adequate parking facilities as hereinafter provided.


8.76.040 General Regulations.

A.    Changes in Use. When an existing use is enlarged, increased or intensified, or a new use having a greater parking requirement than the previous use is proposed, the required number of parking spaces for the new use or existing, enlarged, increased or intensified use shall be calculated and provided as specified by Section 8.76.080.

B.    Continuing Obligation. The maintenance of the parking and loading spaces required shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of the property upon which the building or structure is located as long as the building or structure exists and the use requiring such space continues. It shall be unlawful for an owner of a building or structure affected by these requirements to discontinue, change or dispense with or to cause the discontinuance, sale or transfer of such building or structure, without establishing alternative spaces which conform to those requirements; or for any person, firm, or corporation to use such building or structure without providing such required parking or loading spaces, in compliance with these regulations.

C.    Cross Access Encouraged. Applicants for commercial and industrial developments should be encouraged to provide cross-access to adjacent non-residential properties for convenience, safety and efficient circulation of motor vehicles. A Mutual Access Agreement shall be executed where cross-access is provided.

D.    Gross Floor Area. The computation of he number of parking spaces required for a structure or use is based on the gross floor area of the structure or use the parking serves.

E.    Guest Parking. Required guest parking in residential zoning districts shall be so designated and restricted for the use of guests.

F.    Maintenance. All parking and storage areas shall be maintained so that the pavement is structurally sound, clean and free of dust, mud or trash and striped to City standards. All pavement repair, striping, reconstruction, or restoration work shall be done in accordance with City standards.

G.    Multiple-Use Projects. Where a project contains more than one use type (and typically multiple tenant spaces) such as offices, restaurants, and retail sales, the amount of parking to be provided shall be the total of that required by Section 8.76.080, Parking Requirements by Use Type, for each use type, except as otherwise provided by Section 8.76.050 below, Adjustment to the Number of Parking Spaces.

H.    New Buildings or Development Projects Without Known Tenants. If the type of tenants that will occupy a non-residential building are not known at the time of the development entitlement or building permit approval, the amount of parking to be provided shall be the minimum number of parking spaces required by Section 8.76.080 for a mix of use types typical of comparable buildings or development projects in that zoning district as determined by the Director of Community Development. The intent of this section is to ensure sufficient parking by anticipating a typical use type mix which is appropriate to the design and nature of the building or development project.

I.    No Double Counting of Parking and Loading Spaces. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space.

J.    Off-Street Parking and Loading Plan Required. All uses which require a building permit, site development review or conditional use permit shall be accompanied by an Off-Street Parking and Loading Plan unless waived by the Director. The contents of the Off-Street Parking and Loading Plan shall be to the satisfaction of the Director of Community Development. The Off-Street Parking and Loading Plan may be incorporated into the Site Plan for the Site Development Review or Conditional Use Permit. No building permit, site development review or conditional use permit will be approved unless its Off-Street Parking and Loading Plan complies with the requirements of this Chapter.

K.    Rounding. Where the number of required parking spaces results in a fraction of 0.50 or higher, the requirements shall be rounded up to the next whole space.

L.    Tenant Spaces With Accessory Storage. When a tenant has enclosed accessory storage in excess of 2,000 square feet, the required parking for that portion of the tenant space dedicated to storage shall be calculated as specified by Section 8.76.080 for the Warehousing and Distribution use type which is one parking space per 1,000 square feet of warehousing area. The required parking for the remainder of the tenant space shall be calculated as specified in Section 8.76.080 for the primary use.

M.    Tenant Space With Multiple Functions. When a tenant space contains several Use Types, the amount of parking to be provided shall be the total of that required by Section 8.76.080 for each Use Type, except as otherwise provided by Section 8.76.050 (Adjustment to the Number of Parking Spaces), and except as follows: 

1.    When a tenant space contains several Use Types for the exclusive use of those engaged in the primary use and not otherwise available to the general public, the amount of parking to be provided shall be the total of that required by Section 8.76.080 for the primary Use Type. 

2.    When a tenant space contains permitted accessory uses pursuant to Section 8.40.030 (Accessory Uses), additional parking shall not be required.

N.    Use. The word “use” shall mean both type and intensity of the use, and that a change in use shall be subject to all of the requirements of this Chapter.

O.    Uses Not Listed. Requirements for uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the Director of Community Development, based upon the requirements for comparable uses and upon the particular characteristics of the use. Additional parking for specific uses may also be required upon determination by the Director of Community Development and the Planning Commission. Rev. Ord. 12-11 (October 2011)


8.76.050 Adjustment to the Number of Parking Spaces

A.    Compact Car Space Substitution. Parking lots with 20 or more spaces may substitute compact car spaces for up to 35 percent of the total spaces required. Each compact space shall be labeled “Compact” or “C”.

B.    Motorcycle Space Substitution. Parking lots with 40 or more spaces may replace regular spaces with motorcycle spaces. One regular space may be replaced for each 40 required spaces. Motorcycle spaces shall be a minimum size of 3 by 6 feet.

C.    Off-Site Parking. Where required parking for a use type cannot be feasibly provided on the same site as an approved use, the Zoning Administrator may allow the required parking to be located on an adjacent parcel pursuant to a Conditional Use Permit subject to all of the following requirements:

1.    Conditional Use Permit Findings can be made.

2.    The most distant parking space from a non-residential use type is not more than 400 feet from the use and the most distant parking space from a residential use type is not more than 150 feet from the use.

3.    Additional documents, covenants, deed restrictions, or other agreements as may be deemed necessary by the Director of Community Development are executed to assure that the required parking spaces are provided to the principal use for the life of the documents, covenants, deed restrictions, or other agreements.

4.    The parking lot site is not located in a residential zone unless the principal use requiring the parking is also allowed in a residential zone.

5.    The parking lot site is not within a road easement or private street.

D.    Parking Exception.

1.    Unusual Design Situations. The Director of Community Development may grant a Parking Exception of up to 10% of the required parking spaces when necessary due to unusual design situations. A study shall be prepared by a traffic engineer addressing the request for a Parking Exception. Any approval of a Parking Exception shall be subject to the approval of that study by the Community Development Director.

2.    Trash Enclosures. The Director of Community Development may grant a Parking Exception for a reduction in the number of required parking spaces when a reduction is necessary as a result of the construction of a new trash enclosure or the modification of an existing trash enclosure in compliance with Dublin Municipal Code Chapter 7.98 (Solid Waste and Recycling Enclosure Standards). The Parking Exception shall be limited to the number of required parking spaces that are lost due to the construction of a new or modification of an existing trash enclosure but in no case shall exceed 10% of the required parking. 

E.    Parking Reductions For An Individual Use. When a reduction of off-street parking is proposed because an applicant for a proposed use believes the number of parking spaces required for their use as specified in Section 8.76.080 is not applicable, because the use would function differently than the generic use type and associated parking standards established in this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator may grant a reduction in off-street parking requirements pursuant to Chapter 8.100, Conditional Use Permit, if:

1.    Conditional Use Permit Findings can be made.

2.    The Applicant submits a parking study prepared by a qualified consultant analyzing the parking demands of the proposed use and the parking demands of similar uses in similar situations, demonstrating that the required parking standards are excessive, and proposing alternate parking standards which are appropriate and ensure that there will not be a parking deficiency.

3.    Overflow parking will not impact any adjacent use.

F.    Parking Reductions for Shared Parking.

8.82.050 Determining the Number of Children-Hours per Day within an Outdoor Play Area.

A.    Procedures. In order to determine the allowable “Maximum Number of Children-Hours per Day” as set forth in Table 1 (refer to Section 8.82.040.F) the following procedures shall apply:

1.    Identify the location of the outdoor play area on the Applicant’s Site Plan and determine the center of the play area (refer to subsection B of this section).

2.    Measure the distance from the center of the play area to the nearest residential property line (refer to subsection C of this section). Mark the location on the nearest residential property line as the “Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location” or “ANLML.”

3.    Measure the distance from the ANLML to the edge of the nearest freeway (refer to subsection D of this section) and nearby roadways (refer to subsection E of this section). Based on the measured distances and visibility of the nearest freeway and nearby roadways, determine the Ambient Noise Level (Quieter, Moderate or Noisier) at the ANLML (refer to subsection F of this section).

4.    Locate the applicable Distance “A” in Table 1 and the applicable Ambient Noise Level (Quieter, Moderate or Noisier). Where the row and column intersect is the maximum number of children-hours per day allowed (refer to subsection G of this section).

5.    Calculate the Applicant’s proposed number of children-hours per day (refer to subsection H of this section). Compare this number with the maximum number of children-hours per day allowed from Table 1 (refer to subsection A.4 of this section). If the Applicant’s number is less than the number obtained from Table 1, the project meets the required development standard. If the Applicant’s number is more than the number obtained from Table 1, the Applicant may choose to reduce their number of children-hours or apply for a Minor Use Permit.

B.    Determining the Center of the Play Area. The center of the play area is determined by drawing two diagonal lines from opposite corners of the play area. The center of the play area is the location where the two lines intersect. Any portion of a play area that is blocked from the nearest residential property line by a building shall be disregarded when determining the center of the play area. Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figure 1.

C.    Determining the Distance from the Center of the Play Area to a Residential Property Line (Distance “A”). Distance “A” shall be measured as the shortest, straight-line distance between the center of the play area to the nearest residential property line. The location on the nearest residential property line shall be the “Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location” or “ANLML.” Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figure 1.

D.    Determining the Distance from the Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location (ANLML) to the Nearest Freeway (Distance “X”). Distance “X” shall be measured as the shortest, straight-line distance from the ANLML to the edge of the traveled way of the nearest freeway. Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figures 2 and 3.

E.    Determining the Distance from the Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location (ANLML) to the Nearest Roadway(s) (Distance “Y”). Distance “Y” shall be measured as the shortest, straight-line distance from the ANLML to the edge of the traveled way of the nearest Arterial or Class I Collector, as defined in the Dublin General Plan. Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figures 2 and 3.

F.    Determining the Ambient Noise Level. The existing noise environment is defined by one of three Ambient Noise Level categories: Quieter, Moderate and Noisier. Each category describes the existing noise environment based on the proximity and visibility of freeways and/or roadways to the “Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location” (refer to subsection C of this section). The following describes the characteristics of each Ambient Noise Level category:

1.    Quieter Noise Environment. A “Quieter” noise environment is when the “Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location” meets all of the following criteria: (a) is at least 500 feet from the edge of the traveled way of a freeway; (b) is at least 200 feet from the edge of the traveled way of an Arterial or Class I Collector (as defined in the Dublin General Plan); and (c) the line-of-sight to all freeways and roadways (except Residential and Residential Collector streets, as defined in the General Plan) is blocked by buildings and/or terrain (not including vegetation). Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figure 2.

2.    Moderate Noise Environment. A location shall be considered a “Moderate” noise environment if it does not meet the criteria for a “Quieter” noise environment or a “Noisier” noise environment.

3.    Noisier Noise Environment. A “Noisier” noise environment is when the “Ambient Noise Level Measurement Location” meets the following criteria: (a) is within 150 feet of the edge of the traveled way of a freeway or within 75 feet of the traveled way of an Arterial or Class I Collector (as defined in the Dublin General Plan); and (b) there is at least a partial line-of-sight to the freeway, Arterial or Class I Collector street. Refer to Section 8.82.060, Figure 3.

G.    Determining the Maximum Number of Children-Hours per Day Allowed. The maximum number of children-hours per day allowed within the outdoor play area is set forth in Table 1 and shall be determined based on the distance between the center of the play area and the closest residential property line (Distance “A”) and the Ambient Noise Level (Quieter, Moderate or Noisier).

H.    Calculating the Applicant’s Number of Children-Hours per Day. The Applicant’s Number of Children-Hours per Day shall be calculated by multiplying the number of children in the outdoor play area at any given time by the number of outdoor play periods per day by the duration of the outdoor play period(s). For example, if 30 children use the outdoor play area 4 times a day for 45 minutes each time, then the total “children-hours per day” is calculated as follows: 30 children x 4 play times x .75 (45 minutes equals .75 of 1 hour) = 90 Children-Hours per day. If the number of children and/or the duration of play varies throughout the day, then each play period shall be calculated individually and summed for the total Children-Hours per day.

8.92.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this Chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, the definitions below shall apply. Where any of the definitions in this Chapter may conflict with definitions in Chapter 8.08, the definitions in this Chapter shall prevail for purposes of this Chapter.

A.    Antenna. The term antenna shall mean any system of wires, poles, panels, rods, reflecting disc, or similar devices used for the transmission or reception of electromagnetic waves (or radio frequency signals) when such system is either external to or attached to the exterior of a structure, ground-mounted, or is portable or movable. “Antenna” includes devices having active elements extending in any direction, and directional beam-type arrays having elements carried by and disposed from a generally horizontal boom that may be mounted upon and rotated through a vertical mast or tower interconnecting the boom and antenna support, all of which elements are deemed to be a part of the antenna.

B.    Base Station. The term base station includes any structure other than a tower that supports or houses equipment in a fixed location that enables Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not limited to, wireless facilities mounted on buildings, utility poles and transmission towers, light standards or traffic signals. A structure without wireless equipment replaced with a new structure designed to bear the additional weight of wireless equipment constitutes a “Base Station.”

C.    Collocation. The term collocation shall mean the mounting of a wireless communication facility on or integrated within the same tower or structure as an existing, authorized wireless communication facility.

D.    Fully-Concealed Facility. The term fully-concealed facility refers to wireless communication facilities which are designed and constructed to blend in with the surrounding environment so that the antenna and related equipment are not readily visible. Examples include a cupola on a building, water tank, artificial tree, rocks and a utility pole where all antenna and related equipment are internally-mounted or underground. 

E.    Height. The term height shall mean the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the wireless communication facility, including an antenna or piece of equipment attached thereto. In the case of “crank-up” or other similar towers whose height can be adjusted, the height of the tower shall be the maximum height to which it is capable of being raised.

F.    Owner or Operator. The term owner or operator shall mean the person, entity or agency primarily responsible for installation and maintenance of the wireless communication facility, which may or may not be the same person or entity which is the owner of the property on which the facility is located.

G.    Public Right-of-Way. The term public right-of-way shall mean and include all public streets and easements, now and hereafter owned by the City or other public entity, but only to the extent of the City or public entity’s right, title, interest or authority to grant a license to occupy and use such streets and easements for wireless communication facilities.

H.    Radio Frequency (RF). The term radio frequency (RF) shall mean electromagnetic energy with wave lengths between the audio range and the light range.

I.    Readily Visible. The term readily visible means that an object can be seen from street level by a person with normal vision, and distinguished as an antenna or related equipment of a wireless communication facility, due to the fact that it is not fully concealed, stands out as a prominent feature of the landscape, protrudes above or out from the structure ridgeline, or is otherwise not sufficiently camouflaged or designed to be compatible with the appurtenant architecture or building materials.

J.    Related Equipment. The term related equipment shall mean all equipment ancillary to the transmission and reception of voice and data via radio frequencies. Such equipment may include, but is not limited to, cable conduit and connectors, equipment pads, equipment shelters, cabinets, buildings and access ladders.

K.    Structure Ridgeline. The term structure ridgeline shall mean the line along the top of an existing roof or top of a structure, including existing parapets, penthouses, or mechanical equipment screens.

L.    Tower. The term tower shall mean a mast, pole, monopole, lattice tower, or other structure erected on the ground or on a structure designed and primarily used to support antennas. A ground- or building-mounted mast greater than 15 feet tall and 6 inches in diameter supporting one or more antenna, dishes, arrays, etc., shall be considered a wireless communications tower.

M.    Wireless Communication Facilities. The term wireless communication facilities shall mean a facility that transmits and/or receives electromagnetic signals, including antennas, microwave dishes, parabolic antennas, directional antennas and other types of equipment for the transmission or reception of such signals, towers or similar structures supporting the equipment, equipment buildings, shelters, cabinets, parking area and other accessory development.

N.    Section 6409(a). The term Section 6409(a) refers to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as may be amended or interpreted in judicial or administrative decisions or implementing regulations.

O.    Section 6409(a) Modification. The term Section 6409(a) Modification means a collocation, modification, or replacement of transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station that does not result in a substantial change in the physical dimensions of the existing wireless tower or base station pursuant to Section 6409(a).

P.    Substantial Change. The term substantial change for the purposes of a Section 6409(a) Modification shall mean: 

1.    For wireless towers outside the public right-of-way, a substantial change occurs when the proposed collocation or modification: 

a.    Increases the overall height more than ten (10) percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty (20) feet (whichever is greater); or 

b.    Increases the width more than twenty feet (20) from the edge of the tower or the width of the tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or 

c.    Involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four (4); or 

d.    Involves excavation outside of the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

2.    For wireless towers within the public right-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when the proposed collocation or modification: 

a.    Increases the overall height more than ten (10) percent or ten (10) feet (whichever is greater); or 

b.    Increases the width more than six (6) feet from the edge of the tower or base station; or 

c.    Involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent (10%) larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 

d.    Involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 

e.    Involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 

3.    For all proposed collocations and modifications, a substantial change occurs when: 

a.    The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the concealment elements of the tower or base station; or 

b.    The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided, however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval that is determined to be inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

    The thresholds and conditions for a “substantial change” described in this section are mutually exclusive - the violation of any individual threshold or condition results in a substantial change. The height and width thresholds for a substantial change described in this section are cumulative for each individual wireless tower or base station. The cumulative limit is measured from the physical dimensions of the original structure for base stations and all sites in the public rights-of-way, and from the smallest physical dimensions that existed on or after February 22, 2012, for wireless towers on private property. Rev. Ord. 11-17 (December 2017)

8.92.080 Development Standards and Regulations.

A.    Residential Districts. Wireless communication facilities are prohibited on private property in all residential zoning districts and comparable Planned Development zoning districts except as indicated in Section 8.92.040.

B    Location Criteria. All wireless communication facilities shall be located so as to minimize their visibility. The following measures shall be implemented:

1.    No wireless communication facilities shall be installed on an exposed ridgeline, or at a location readily visible from I-580, I-680, or scenic corridor identified in the Eastern Dublin Scenic Corridor Policy, or on property designated Parks/Recreation, Open Space, or Stream Corridor on the Dublin General Plan, unless it blends with the surrounding existing natural and artificial environment in such a manner as to not be readily visible, and a finding is made that no other location is technically feasible and complies with those policy documents;

2.    No facility may be located within the front setback, along major street frontages where it will be readily visible or between the face of a building and a public street, bikeway or park, except for approved facade-mounted equipment or facilities located on existing structures;

3.    No towers shall be installed closer than one half mile from any existing tower unless technologically required (technical evidence must be submitted to the Community Development Director showing a clear need for this facility, and the infeasibility of collocating it on an existing site), or visually preferable (i.e., fully-concealed facility that blends with the surrounding existing natural and artificial environment);

4.    Each facility shall be operated in such a manner so as to minimize any possible disruption caused by noise. Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power outages, and shall not be tested on weekends or holidays, or between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekday nights. At no time shall equipment noise from any source exceed an exterior noise level of 60 dB at the property line. If the facility is located within one hundred (100) feet of a residential use, noise attenuation measures shall be included to reduce noise levels to a level of 50 dBA measured at the property line;

5.    All towers shall be set back at least twenty percent (20%) of the tower height from all property lines, and at least one hundred (100) feet from any public trail, park, or outdoor recreation area, unless it is a fully-concealed facility that blends with the surrounding existing natural and artificial environment.

C.    Design Review Criteria. In addition to all other requirements set forth in this Chapter, all wireless communication facilities shall meet the following design requirements:

1.    Minimizing Visual Impact. All wireless communication facilities shall incorporate appropriate techniques to camouflage, disguise and/or blend them into the surrounding environment. Wireless communication facilities shall be in scale and designed to blend with the existing natural or built surroundings and existing supporting structures. The City shall have the authority to require special design features for the wireless communication facilities in areas of particular sensitivity (e.g., proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views and/or community features). 

    Based on potential aesthetic impact, the order of preference for facility type is: (a) Collocation sites, when such siting minimizes adverse effects related to land use compatibility, visual resources, public safety, and other environmental factors, (b) building-mounted (facade or roof) facilities, (c) ground-mounted facilities and (d) a new tower.

2.    Paint and Finish Materials. Wireless communication facilities including the antennas and related equipment shall be constructed out of nonreflective materials, painted and/or textured to match the existing support structure and painted to blend with their surroundings. 

3.    Related Equipment. All equipment shelters or cabinets must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of surrounding structures or placed underground. Support equipment pads, cabinets, shelters and buildings require architectural, landscape, color, or other camouflage treatment to minimize visual impacts. 

4.    Lightning Arrestors and Beacon Lights. Lightning arrestors and beacon lights shall not be included in the design of facilities unless required by the FAA. Lightning arrestors and beacons shall be included when calculating the height of facilities such as towers.

5.    Height. The maximum height of a wireless communication facility shall be equal to the height limit for the district in which it is located. An exception to the height limit may be approved based on a visual analysis demonstrating that views of the facility are minimized or are substantially screened, and on an engineering analysis justifying the height of the proposed facility and demonstrating that a lower height is not feasible. 

6.    Lighting. Wireless communication facilities shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority and designed to ensure the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

7.    Satellite Dish/Parabolic Antennas - Ground-Mounted. Satellite dish or parabolic antennas that are ground-mounted shall be situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their function. No such antenna shall be located in any front yard, nor in a corner side yard unless the antenna is screened from pedestrian-level view. No such antenna exceeding 39 inches in diameter shall be located within a required setback unless approved through a Site Development Review application upon a showing that no reasonable alternative location is available.

8.    Roof Setbacks. Roof-mounted antennas shall be constructed at the minimum height possible to serve the operator’s service area. Roof-mounted antennas shall be designed to minimize their visibility and blend with the surroundings. Placing roof-mounted antennas in direct line with significant view corridors shall be avoided. Rev. Ord. 11-17 (December 2017)


8.92.090 Removal of Abandoned Facilities.

Any wireless communication facilities that are not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such facilities or the owner of the property upon which the facilities are located shall remove the same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Community Development Director notifying the owners of the removal requirement. If such facilities are not removed within the ninety (90) days, the Community Development Director may cause the antenna or tower to be removed at the expense of the owners of the facilities and the property. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, the tower shall not be deemed abandoned and shall not be subject to these provisions until all users have abandoned the facility. Rev. Ord. 11-17 (December 2017)

Ordinary maintenance and minor repair of non-conforming structures is permitted if the aggregate cost of the work done in any period of 12 consecutive months does not exceed 25% of the replacement value of the structure as determined by the building official and provided further that the size of the structure or number of dwelling units is not increased.

A non-conforming structure which is damaged to an extent of 50% or less of its replacement cost as determined by the Building Official immediately prior to such damage may be restored only if made to conform to all provisions of this Ordinance.

Reconstruction shall commence within two years after the catastrophe and shall be diligently pursued to completion.

E.    Repairs and alterations to non-conforming residence. Repairs and alterations may be made to non-conforming residences, including multifamily structures, without replacement cost limitations, if located in a residential zoning district and if the requirements of “A” above are met.

9.28.010 Authority.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code and the general police power of the city. (Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 1-91 § 1 (8-7.0))


9.28.020 Requirement.

Each subdivider of the land classified by the zoning ordinance (Title 8) for residential use shall as a condition to filing a final map or parcel map dedicate or reserve lands, pay fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes. Requirements shall be established by the advisory agency when acting on the tentative tract map or tentative parcel map in consultation with the City Public Works Department or Parks and Community Services Department. Land or fees required under this chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the city, which provides community-wide park and recreational services, upon approval of the final map or parcel map. (Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 1-91 § 1 (8-7.1))


9.28.030 Limitations.

A.    The land, fees, or combination thereof are to be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities bearing a reasonable relationship to use by future inhabitants of the subdivision.

B.    The city shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivision in a manner consistent with the limitations of this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act. Any fees collected under this chapter shall be committed within five (5) years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half (1/2) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such fees are not timely committed, they shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision.

C.    Park and recreational facilities shall be in accord with principles and standards of the parks and open space element of the city’s general plan and the city’s parks and recreation master plan.

D.    Only the payment of fees may be required in subdivisions containing fifty (50) parcels or less, except that when a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project, as those terms are defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, exceeds fifty (50) dwelling units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding that the number of parcels may be less than fifty (50). In subdivisions larger than fifty (50) parcels, this requirement may be satisfied by dedicating land and/or payment of fees as determined by the advisory agency.

E.    The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions or to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling units are added. (Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 4-96 § 13; Ord. 1-91 § 1 (8-7.2))


9.28.040 Amount of land to be dedicated.

It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare require that five (5) acres of property for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within the city be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. The amount of land to be dedicated, or fees to be paid, shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreation facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be the amount calculated from the following formula:

LAND = A x B

A.    “A” means the park and recreation area required per dwelling unit, based on the type of dwelling units of the proposed subdivision and the park area per one thousand (1,000) people of the city.

1.    The park area of the city is determined to be five (5) acres per one thousand (1,000) people, or five-one-thousandths (0.005) acre per person, which is further broken down to three (3) acres per one thousand (1,000) people for active community parks, three-tenths (0.3) acre per one thousand (1,000) people for natural community parks, and one and seven-tenths (1.7) acres per one thousand (1,000) people for neighborhood parks.

2.    The park and recreation area required per dwelling unit, “A,” is established as follows:

a.    Each single-family dwelling unit is assigned three and eight one-hundredths (3.08) people.

b.    Each other multifamily dwelling unit is assigned one and eighty-eight one-hundredths (1.88) people.

c.    Each senior housing dwelling unit is assigned one and twelve one-hundredths (1.12) people.

B.    “B” means the number of dwelling units in the proposed subdivision. For the purpose of this section, the number of dwelling units in the proposed subdivision shall be determined as follows: For single-family and townhome subdivisions, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of lots or parcels created for residential use as indicated on the final map or parcel map. When the subdivision is for other multifamily or senior housing, the number of dwelling units shall equal the maximum number of residential units allowed within the proposed subdivision. For residential condominium projects, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of condominium units indicated on the final map or parcel map. For planned development projects, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of dwelling units indicated on the approved planned development plan. (Ord. 8-17 § 1: Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 8-15 § 2: Ord. 6-96 § 1: Ord. 1-91 § 1 (8-7.3))

B.    At the time of approval of the tentative map for the subdivision, the advisory agency shall determine whether land, in-lieu fees, or a combination of land and fees, shall be dedicated and/or paid by the subdivider.

C.    The advisory agency may approve, modify or disapprove the recommendation of the Parks and Community Services Commission or Parks and Community Services Director; provided, however, any modification of the recommendation not previously considered shall first be referred back to the Parks and Community Services Commission or Recreation Director for further report and recommendation.

If the City Engineer determines that an exception is warranted, a condition of approval shall be included for consideration by the advisory agency for the tentative tract map. (Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh.

9.40.060 Development inconsistent with zoning—Conditional approval.

A.    Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved, or conditionally approved, vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Government Code Section 66498.1(b), confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved.

B.    The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 9.40.050. (Ord. 4-16 § 1 (Exh. A) (part): Ord. 1-91 § 1 (8-10.8). Formerly 9.40.080)

An application shall clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies or standard for which the amendment is sought.

A) (part): Ord. 4-96 § 20. Formerly 9.40.100)
