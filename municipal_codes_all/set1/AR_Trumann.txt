ARTICLE IX. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
Section 9.01.0. Purpose and General Provisions
The purposes of the Planned Unit Development district is to promote flexibility and innovation in design, in both small and large-scale developments, while encouraging the simultaneous development of multiple amenities beneficial to both the users of the development and the city as a whole. Planned Unit Developments are also intended for use in creative and innovative development of vacant in-fill parcels in the built-up areas of the city, and the incorporation of open space in developments.
In concept, the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a combination of zoning designation and development plan. The approval process is designed to encourage innovation by the developer by allowing submittal of engineered plans, known as a Final PUD Plan, after approval of a Preliminary PUD Plan to rezone the property. Development must follow the approved Final PUD Plan exactly. Failure in this respect can result in revocation of the PUD. Although design innovation is encouraged, and flexibility is allowed, the PUD may not be used simply as a method of avoiding zoning regulations.
Section 9.02.0. Minimum Size and Use Criteria
PUD applications may be residential, commercial, industrial, mixed-use in nature. Mixed-use PUDs may incorporate multiple uses in a development, property, or single-structure.
The minimum size for an area to be developed as a PUD shall be five (5) acres.
Section 9.03.0. Development Standards
A. Use Permitted: Permitted uses within a PUD shall conform to the permitted uses within the existing zoning district in which the PUD is being proposed, or/and shall be consistent with the general character of the land use classification of the subject property in the city’s Land Use Plan, or/and be substantially similar to and compatible with adjacent property.
B. Development Density: All plans shall clearly depict the proposed density by land use category. Residential density shall be depicted in the manner described in paragraph D, item 1 below titled “Residential Density”. Non-residential density shall be expressed as Floor Area Ratio.
C. Setbacks: Building setbacks will be designed in such a manner that they create a harmonious grouping of buildings, allow maintenance of streets and utilities, do not violate any safety codes including the Arkansas Fire Prevention Code, and do not restrict the provision of emergency or public services.
D. Lot Size and Area Requirements: No minimum lot sizes are established. Housing and development can be clustered or otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned locations on the site to take advantage of natural features and topography. The following restrictions apply:
1. Residential Density
Residential density for any development shall not exceed the following standards as measured by dwelling units per developable acre (dua). Calculation shall not include areas devoted to surface streets and surface drainage improvements. This shall be computed by the equation below:
City of Trumann Page 31 Zoning Code
Housing Units / (Developable Land + Common Usable Open Space) = Residential Density
Single-Family: 7 dua
Single-Family Zero Lot Line: 8 dua
Duplex: 9 dua
Townhouses/Condominium: 11 dua
Multi-Family (1-2 stories): 18 dua
Multi-Family (3 stories or more): 24 dua
Mixed-Use with Multi-Family: 36 dua
E.Common Usable Open Space: PUDs with exclusively residential land use shall designate at least fifteen (15) percent of the total development area to common usable open space.
F.Common Usable Open Space – Future Phase Construction: If common usable open space andcommon space improvements required for a development are planned for construction in future phases, a performance bond shall be required. Prior to the sale of any lot, site, home or other structure, a bond of sufficient surety determined by the Administrative Official shall be posted with the City for completion of said common usable open space improvements. The amount of the bond shall reflect 150 percent of the Administrative Official’s estimate for completing the required improvements.

H. Encourage appropriate and best uses land.
I. Provide for efficiency and economy in the process of development.
Section 1.02 Authority

Section 1.03 Jurisdiction and Application
1.03.01 Jurisdiction
The provisions of these regulations shall apply within the City of Trumann and to any property served by or seeking to be served by Trumann city utilities within the City of Trumann planning area boundary as reflected on the Trumann Comprehensive Plan Map. A copy of this map is recorded with the Poinsett County Circuit Clerk.
1.03.02 Application
These regulations and development standards shall apply to the following forms of land
2
subdivision and development:
A. The provisions of access to lots and parcels;
B. The extension or provision of utilities;
C. The parceling of land resulting in the need for access and utilities;
D. All land subdivision or platting of a tract, lot, or parcel of land into two or more tracts, lots, sites, or parcels, any of which, when subdivided, shall contain less than five (5) acres in area.
E. The construction of any street or public utility through any tract of land within the corporate limits of the City of Trumann.
F. A development, excluding single-family and two-family structures, on one lot containing a building or buildings with a combined square footage of 1,000 square feet or larger.
G. Any commercial building or establishment designed or intended for the sale of petroleum or other flammable products or any commercial or industrial use with accompanying hazards.
H. Routine commercial developments not meeting any of the criteria listed above shall not require planning commission approval. However, in unique cases, the Administrative Official may require planning commission approval prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Certain properties remain exempted from the requirements of the Subdivision and Development Code. These include the following.
A. The subdivision of land into tracts of five acres or greater that do not require the construction and dedication of new streets, vacation of existing streets or easements, or any improvements which might require the creation of any easements.
B. The Planning Commission may exempt a minor purchase of a portion of an adjoining parcel where the size of the land being acquired is smaller in area than the minimum lot for the appropriate zoning and where it can be determined that the purposes of the Development and Subdivision Code are not being subverted.
C. Any conveyance or conveyances that include the transfer of like kind exchange or any lot, parcel, tract, lot of record, fractional lot conveyance, or isolated conveyance; either directly or indirectly involved in the assemblage and aggregation of property for a single manufacturing or industrial use, including the generation of electricity.
Section 1.04 Policies
The policies underlying the provisions of this article are set forth in the following sections:
A. Land to be subdivided or developed shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or other menace, and
3
land shall not be subdivided or developed until adequate public facilities and improvements exist and proper provisions have been made for drainage, water, sewerage, and capital improvements such as schools, parks, recreational facilities, transportation facilities, and improvements.
B. The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly related to the provisions and standards contained in the Building Code, Zoning Code, Comprehensive Plan, and other capital budgets and programs of the city.

4
ARTICLE II. DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 2.01 General
In addition to the specific requirements for improvements and their design, the following general principles shall guide the staff and planning commission in their review of proposed developments and subdivision of land.
2.01.1 Conformance to Existing Plans and Regulations
The purpose of this portion of the Code is to specify the basic and minimum requirements for lots, blocks, streets, and other physical elements in new subdivisions. These standards constitute the minimums which are to be observed by developers. In order that the various purposes of this Code may be accomplished, all subdivisions hereinafter established (1) shall conform with the various elements of the Comprehensive Plan including the location of major thoroughfares and streets, the location of parks, playgrounds, schools and other public sites, and appropriate land uses; and (2) shall be designed to conform with the minimum zoning and building regulations for the area in which the proposed subdivision is located.
2.01.2 Suitability of the Land
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, and erosion, and any and deemed by the Planning Commission to be topographically or otherwise unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor shall such land be platted for any other uses as may continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life or property unless steps are taken to diminish these hazards.
2.01.3 Floodplain Areas
Land within the 100 year flood plain shall not be platted unless the subdivider incorporates improvements that will render the area substantially safe for development and in accordance with all flood plain regulations.
2.01.4 Design Where Future Resubdivision is Indicated
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will be eventually resubdivided into small building sites, the Planning Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
2.01.5 Provision of Land for Public Use
The Planning Commission may require reservation of suitable sites for public uses indicated on the Comprehensive Plan for a period of up to six (6) months after the filing of a Letter of Intent to Develop by the subdivider. Such reservations shall be referred to the appropriate public board, commission, or body having jurisdiction or financial responsibility, to permit the opportunity to acquire said sites either through purchase, taking an option, or the filing of condemnation proceedings under the power of eminent domain. The failure or refusal of any public entity to acquire lands designated as suitable sites for public uses within six (6) months of the filing of a
5
letter of intent to develop by the subdivider shall relieve the subdivider of any responsibility to hold such land for future public purposes.
2.01.6 Zoning or Other Regulations
No Record Plat of land within jurisdictional area of the Trumann Zoning Code shall be approved unless it conforms to the Trumann Zoning Code. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code, or other official regulations or ordinance the most restrictive shall apply. The Planning Commission shall grant no waiver to the subdivision regulations that would have the effect of violating any provision of the zoning regulations.
2.01.7 Adequacy of Public Facilities and Services
Land which is neither provided, nor programmed by the city within the corporate limits to have adequate water, sanitary sewer services or storm drainage facilities shall not be subdivided for purposes which require such services unless the developer provides such services.
2.01.8 Subdivision and Street Names
The proposed name of subdivision and streets shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any street or subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Planning Commission in consultation with the Poinsett County 911 Address Coordinator shall review and have final authority to designate street and subdivision names.
2.01.9 Public Street Access Required
Every subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street. Every lot or parcel within a subdivision shall have direct access to a public street.
2.01.10 Location of Streets
All highways and street right-of-ways, and other features of the Master Street Plan, shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and the dimension indicated on the Master Street Plan.
Section 2.02 Subdivision and Development Design Standards
The design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles established by the Comprehensive Plan for land use, traffic circulation, community facilities, and public utility services, and in accordance with the following design standards.
2.02.1 Streets
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to all of the elements of the Comprehensive Plan and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions:
A. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
B. Proper access in the form of stub streets or temporary dead-end streets shall be provided to
6
adjacent unplatted property unless, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, topographic conditions or similar physical impediments preclude reasonable provision of such access, or alternate routes of access are, or will be available in the future.
C. Where a property is adjacent to an existing stub street, it shall be required to extend the stub street through the property when platted.
D. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is placed with the City under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
E. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. The Planning Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries.
F. The street names shall require the approval of the Planning Commission after review by the 911 addressing coordinator. Streets that obviously are in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street.
G. The Planning Commission may limit the points of access on major streets.
2.02.2 Street Design
A. Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths
The right-of-way width shall be the distance across a street from property line to property line. The minimum street right-of-way and pavement width shall conform to the street cross section standards designated within the Master Street Plan portion of the Comprehensive Plan. See Chapter Six of the Trumann Comprehensive Plan.

Cul-de-sacs or courts designed to have one end closed should be no more than five hundred (500) feet long without special permission of the Trumann Fire Department. Such streets will be provided at the closed end with a turn-around. This turn-around shall met the minimum requirements of the Arkansas State Fire Prevention Code.
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements from each side of the center line. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
B. Street Grades
The minimum grade for all streets shall be 0.5% unless the developer offers a suitable design for draining the street of surface storm water.
C. Intersections
The center line of no more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any point. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees.
Curb radii at street intersections shall not be less than twenty (20) feet; unless trees or utility poles require less; and where the angle of a street intersection is less than ninety (90) degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater curb radius. When necessary to permit the construction of a curb having desirable radium without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.
Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall not be allowed unless special circumstances warrant a waiver as specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create any traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
2.02.3 Alleys
Alleys may be allowed at the rear of all platted lots. The width of an alley shall be not less than twenty (20) feet.
2.02.4 Easements
Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide.
Where a subdivision is crossed by a creek, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided conforming substantially to the lines of such water course, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the
8
purpose. Parallel streets may be required in connection therewith. No building or structure may be erected over or in an easement.
2.02.5 Blocks
The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following:
A. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
B. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
C. Needs for convenient access, circulations, control, and safety of street traffic.
D. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
Blocks of less than three hundred (300) feet in length or more than six hundred (600) feet in length are discouraged except as the terrain itself makes blocks of other length desirable. When a block exceeds six hundred (600) feet in length, the Planning Commission may require a dedicated easement not less than fifteen (15) feet in width and a paved crosswalk not less than four (4) feet in width to provide pedestrian access across the block.
Blocks used for residential purposes should be of sufficient width to allow for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business and industrial use should be of a width suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and loading facilities.
2.02.6 Lots
The shape of residential lots shall not be required to conform to any stated pattern. The Planning Commission shall judge lot shape on the type of development and on the use to which the lots will be put. Corner Lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building set back from and orientation at both streets. The following are lot dimension guidelines:
A. Lots within the city limits shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Code.
B. Lots not served by sanitary sewer and/or public water supply shall be of sufficient size to conform to the regulations and specifications of the Arkansas State Health Department.
C. The minimum building setback line shall conform to the setbacks appropriate to the property’s zoning district unless within the Planning Area. Those developments and subdivisions within the Planning Area shall designate a zoning district appropriate to the property and conform to the setback requirements of that district.
Pipe-stem lots may only be permitted in residential subdivisions provided that the stem or narrowest part of such a lot shall not be less than twenty (20) feet in width or have a length of more than two-hundred fifty (250) feet. In pipe-stem lots, the building line shall be computed from the front lot line and not associated with the pipe-stem portion. Pipe-stem lots are to only be used on rare occasions in order to make use of otherwise unusable properties.

ARTICLE III. REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Section 3.01 General Provisions
Every subdivider shall be required to install streets, utilities, and public improvements in accordance with the following standards and specifications.

For smaller developments an engineered drainage plan shall not be required unless it is determined by the Planning Commission to be necessary to protect health, safety, and welfare.
A. Facilities for storm drainage shall be designed and constructed so as to minimize any increase in the rate of storm runoff onto adjoining property over that which existed prior to the development. If this is not practical, the subdivider may be allowed to participate in the provision of off-site improvements needed to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the additional runoff due to development. Participation shall come in the form of a fee in-lieu of improvements. Participation shall be allowed at the discretion of the City’s Engineer.
B. Facilities for storm drainage shall be of adequate capacity, and designed in accordance with not less than an one in fifty (50) year rainfall. Facilities may include open and closed systems and systems may include detention/retention structures.
C. Provisions shall be made for storm water emergency overflow in subdivisions and developments having enclosed storm systems. The emergency overflow for subdivisions and developments consists of two design considerations:
1. An underground system shall be designed to carry enough water to allow the streets passable for emergency service vehicles during a storm of 50-year return frequency; and,
2. An above-ground system consisting of swales or other drainage mechanisms with the capacity to carry excess water not carried by the underground system. This system shall have the capacity of a storm of a fifty (50) year return frequency.
D. An open or closed storm drainage system design may be used to meet the requirements of this section. Where a closed system is used, this system shall be designed, located, and constructed:
13
1. To accommodate a one in fifty (50) year rainfall without necessitating a water depth greater than 4½ inches at the gutter line for that rainfall that falls upon and enters the pavement area; and,
2. So that all water which enters the pavement areas shall exit the street through inlets only. In some cases, where the rate of flow is less than three cubic feet per second (3 cfs), breaks in the curb with concrete aprons within the City right-of-way may be allowed.
E. Concrete valleys may be utilized at all surface cross drains where surface water drainage to be accommodated is less than three (3) cubic feet per second. Concrete valleys shall have a minimum width of four feet (4’) and cross section sloped of one inch (1”) per one foot (1’). Underground drain pipes are required for all cross drains where surface water drainage to be accommodated is greater than five cubic feet per second (5 cfs).
F. Where a subdivision or development is traversed by a natural watercourse, drainage way, or stream, there shall be provided a storm drainage easement of necessary width, conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse or as otherwise approved by the Administrative Official.
G. Box culverts and bridges which cross streets in the city right-of-way shall be of sufficient length to accommodate estimated future vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
H. Any area or lot which may be prone to local flooding shall have the minimum elevation of the lowest allowable finished floor elevation indicated on the record plat. This elevation shall be that corresponding to one foot above the flood elevation for a 100-year rainfall intensity.
I. Rainfall may not be diverted from one watershed to another within the plat boundaries.
Section 3.07 Monuments
Subdivisions shall be monumented in accordance with the Arkansas Minimum Standards for Boundary Surveys. All monuments, found or set, shall be shown on the record plat.
Section 3.08 Lot Markers

ARTICLE IV. PLATTING PROCEDURE
Section 4.01 General
A subdivider proposing to make or have made a subdivision within the area under the authority of this code shall not proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, including grading, before obtaining Construction plat approval; nor shall he attempt to record the plat of the subdivision or any part thereof prior to obtaining record plat approval from the Planning Commission, and acceptance of public dedications by the City Council.
Section 4.02 Construction Plat
When any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, the subdivider or his agent shall submit to the Planning Commission a letter of intent which may at the option of the subdivider include a preliminary sketch plan. The subdivider’s letter shall indicate the location and size of the tract, the proposed time schedule, the date on which the subdivider proposes to submit his Construction plat for Planning Commission review, and such other information as the subdivider deems important for recognition by the Planning Commission.
If the proposed subdivision is a portion of a tract which is later to be subdivided in its entirety, then a tentative master plan for the entire subdivision shall be submitted with the Construction plat of the portion first to be subdivided. The master plan shall conform in all respects to the requirements of the Construction plat.
Upon review of the letter of intent, the Planning Commission may recommend a Pre-Application Conference to be held between the subdivider, a committee of the Planning Commission, and /or the Planning Commission’s designated agents for land planning and engineering.
4.02.1 Pre-Application Conference
When a major subdivision of a tract of land within the Planning Commission’s jurisdiction is proposed, the subdivider is urged to consult early and informally with the City and/or designated members of the Planning Commission. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision
At such meeting, the general character of the development will be discussed and items will be included concerning zoning, utility service, street requirements, and other pertinent factors related to the proposed subdivision. The purpose of the Pre-Application review is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the Planning Commission in order to facilitate the subsequent preparation and approval of plans.
A developer may request to have a sketch plat reviewed by the full Planning Commission. Comments and approvals made concerning a sketch plan are not binding on the Planning Commission; however, it is the policy of the City that, having tentatively approved a sketch plat, the Planning Commission shall not unreasonably withhold approval of a Construction plat that is substantially identical to the sketch plan.
16
4.02.2 Submission Requirements
The next required step in the process is the submission of an Application for Construction Plat Approval. Requirements of this submission are set out in ARTICLE 5, Section 5.01. A filing fee as specified in ARTICLE 8, Section 8.03, shall be paid at time of filing at City Hall. Any subdivision proposing street and/or drainage improvements and/or water or sewer improvements shall have the improvements designed by a Registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the State of Arkansas. An Engineer’s Cost Estimate of the construction costs of all proposed improvements shall be included with the submission of the Construction Plat. The cost estimate shall contain amounts and unit prices for the various items involved. Lump sum or unrealistic estimates will not be accepted. The applicant may defer submission of improvement plans to follow planning commission approval. The applicant shall not receive Authorization to Proceed as detailed in Section 4.02.5 without approval of improvement plans by the city’s engineer.
For purposes of preliminary engineering review, the Application and initial submission shall include nine (9) complete sets of plans and specifications at least twenty-one (21) days in advance of the Planning Commission at which the application is desired to be heard.
The Construction Plat shall clearly depict the phase of development that is to be constructed within the next eighteen (18) months. Approval of the Construction Plat shall apply only to those phases of the development that shall be constructed in the next eighteen (18) months.
The Construction Plat shall depict all land under contiguous ownership of which the proposed subdivision is a part. If the development depicted appears as a portion of a larger tract to be developed at a later time, the Planning Commission may require a master plan and phasing plan of the entire development.
4.02.3 Construction Review
The Administrative Official, in council with Trumann Public Works, Trumann Street Department, City Engineer, Trumann Fire Department, and other designated staff, shall review the documents received for compliance with design standards of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, Master Street Plan component of the Comprehensive Plan, zoning and subdivision codes, fire protection and utility requirements. Processing of the plat shall cease at this step for any Construction Plat that is not consistent with the above. The plat shall be returned to the developer and design engineer with all deficiencies or required modifications noted. The developer may then revise the plat to achieve conformity or make a request for an amendment to the offending plan or code.
The developer shall then supply nine (9) complete sets of the plans and documents as modified for approval. The application and supporting plans and documents will be placed on the agenda of the Planning Commission for consideration at their next regular meeting.
4.02.4 Construction Approval
After the Planning Commission has reviewed the Construction plat and construction plans and engineering report, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or additions. The Planning Commission shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the Construction Plat within 45 days from receipt thereof, unless the Applicant is notified in writing by the Commission Chairman that additional time is required. If disapproved, the Construction plat shall be returned to the subdivider with a written statement as to the reasons for disapproval.
17
The Planning Commission’s approval of a construction plat shall be deemed as an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the construction plat as a guide to the installation of streets, water, drainage, sewer, and other required improvements and utilities, the dedication of reservation of public lands, and to the preparation of the record plat. Approval of a construction plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the record plat.
When the Planning Commission finds that the construction plat, together with the site improvements plan, meets all the requirements of this Code, it shall approve the plat by placing a stamp of Construction Plat Approval upon the construction plat. The stamp of Construction Plat Approval shall read: “This plat has been given construction plat approval only, and has not been approved for recording as a public record. This certificate shall expire on__________ (date).” Such stamp of approval shall bear the signature of the Chairman of the Planning Commission; and shall be dated.
If approved, the original copy will be filed in the Planning Commission’s records in City Hall.
The Planning Commission shall approve a Construction Plat upon determining the following:
A. That the plat conforms to all adopted plans, policies, and ordinances of the City of Trumann.
B. That the plat conforms to the regulations contained in this code.
C. That the developer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission the capacity to undertake the proposed improvements.
D. That the Construction Plat will not add a financial burden to the City or its taxpayers.
E. That the proposed development will not result in off-site improvement costs to the City unless confirmed by written agreement between the City and the developer.
F. That all utilities, both public and private, are adequate to handle the demand to be created by the proposed subdivision.
G. That all utility structures and streets within the subdivision are designed in such a manner to permit development of adjacent properties and that agreements are in place for cost-sharing of required oversized utility structures.
4.02.5 Authorization to Proceed
Receipt of an approved or conditionally approved copy of the construction plat, together with an approved copy of the improvements plan shall constitute authorization of the Planning Commission for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the record plat, the installation of improvements, and the staking out of lots and blocks. The subdivider, after approval of the construction plat, shall complete all improvements required under this Code. The approved copy of the construction plat must contain a signed Certificate of Construction Plat Approval to be considered valid. No Authorization to Proceed shall be provided to subdivider if required improvements plan have not been submitted and approved.
18
The City Engineer, Administrative Official, or other designated staff may inspect the improvement work at any time to confirm materials used, construction methods employed, and conformance to approved plans and specifications and other applicable standards.
4.02.6 Expiration of Construction Plat Approval
A construction plat which has been approved and received a signed Certificate of Construction Plat Approval shall be effective and binding upon the Planning Commission for no more than twenty-four (24) months, as shown on the Certificate of Construction Plat Approval. If installation of all required improvements is not completed by the expiration date of the Certificate of Construction Plat Approval, the construction plat shall be considered null and void unless the subdivider is permitted an extension of approval by the Planning Commission. Any plat not receiving record plat approval or granted an extension shall be required to resubmit for re-approval as a construction plat.
Section 4.03 Record Plat
When the requirements of this Code have been satisfied and while the Construction Plat Approval is in effect, the subdivider may submit to the Planning Commission an application for review and approval of the record plat.
4.03.1 Submission Requirements
At least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit an application which shall consist of:
A. A letter of application requesting review and approval of the record plat.
B. The record plat in an original tracing or reproducible and other documents as specified in Article 5, Section 5.02.
C. The Contractor who performs the work shall post a maintenance bond or letter of credit with the city covering any defects in materials and workmanship for the required improvements in the amount of fifty (50) percent of the total cost of those improvements, and stating that any and all defects in materials and workmanship shall be corrected by the contractor by the end of the bond period. Maintenance Bond or letter(s) of credit shall be in full force for not less than one (1) year from date of filing of Record Plat. Work performed under terms of the Bond shall be approved by the City. If the contractor is unable to post bond the developer shall post the required bond on behalf of the contractor.
D. A filing fee as specified in Article 8, Section 8.03.
4.03.2 Approval by Planning Commission
The record plat of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for final approval within eighteen (18) months of the date on which the construction plat was approved. If not submitted for final approval within such time, the construction plat shall be considered as having been abandoned, unless the Planning Commission agrees to an extension of time.
19
If the subdivider requests permission to develop only a portion of the property for which the construction plat was approved, the Planning Commission may grant approval of a record plat for said portion alone.
The Administrative Official shall review the submission, in council with the City Engineer, Street Department, Trumann Fire Department, Trumann Public Works, and shall determine compliance of the project with approved plans and applicable standards. The application, with the City Engineer’s report, shall be filed with the Planning Commission for consideration at its regular meeting.
The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the record plat within forty-five (45) Days of receipt thereof, or notify the Applicant in writing that additional time is required. Disapproval of the plat shall be reported to the Applicant in writing within ten (10) days after the meeting at which the plat was disapproved.
Upon approval, the original plat and all copies shall be signed, reviewed and distributed in accordance with the provisions contained in subsection 4.03.3 and 4.03.4 below.
Approval of the record plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets or other public ways or grounds, nor does it constitute authority for the plat to be recorded.
4.03.3 Acceptance of Public Dedications
Before the Record Plat is recorded in the office of the County Recorder, an agreement shall be reached between the subdivider or his agent and the City Council. Said agreement shall be with regard to the installation of any street improvements or utility construction called for in the subdivision plat; the dedication and/or reservation of lands for public use; the dedication and acceptance of utilities and public improvements; and other agreements as required in the Planning Commission’s approval of the plat. The Maintenance Bond to cover public improvements shall be on file with the City Council before consideration of acceptance of public dedications. Additionally, before such action, the City Council must receive one of the following:
A. A certificate of completion from the City Engineer, stating that all required improvements and installations have been made, added, or installed; or
B. A cash deposit in the full amount as determined by the City, necessary to complete the improvements and installations in compliance with this Code for the portion of the subdivision for which record plat approval is sought. Such cash deposit may be withdrawn in direct proportion to the amount of work completed as approved by the City; or
C. An executed agreement with the City which shall:
1. Be in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient to complete the improvements and installations for the subdivision in compliance with this Code.
2. Specify the time for the completion of the improvements and installations.
20
3. Be accompanied by a letter of credit which shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. The period of time shall be specified in the resolution approving the record plat and shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not in any event exceed two (2) years from the date of final approval. Such letter of credit shall provide the city means to withdraw funds if improvements are not completed.
4.03.4 Recording
Upon approval of the record plat and acceptance of the public dedications by the City Council, the City Clerk shall have the record plat recorded in the office of the Circuit Clerk. The subdivider shall pay all fees in connection with the recording of said plat.
The record plat shall be filed in the office of the Circuit Clerk within ninety (90) days after approval by the Planning Commission; and if not filed within such time, said approval shall be considered as having been abandoned.
