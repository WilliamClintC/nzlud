regulations adopted under laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full force and effect unless
repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of this code.

that the sections were originally enacted. The section most recently enacted supersedes any
conflicting section or division.
(D) All references within a section of this code to any section of previously existing laws
refer to the numbers in the original enactment.
(E) (1) The numerical designations and descriptive headings assigned to the various titles,
chapters, subchapters or sections of this code, as originally enacted or as added by amendment,
are not law, and may be altered by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any
official publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive headings are for
organizational purposes only and do not affect the meaning, application or construction of the law
they precede.
(2) Each note following a section of this code is for reference purposes only and is not
a part of the section.
(F) All references to any section of this code refer to all subsequent amendments to that
section, unless otherwise provided.
(I.C. 1-1-1-5)

(1) Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary and usual sense.
Technical words and phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be
understood according to their technical import.

perform in addition to the principal, the performance of the act by an authorized deputy or agent
is valid.

provision, each division or part of every section is severable. If any portion or application of a
section is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect the remainder of the section unless:

title of the functionary.
(B) Name designations. Whenever any ordinance or resolution of the Council refers to any
board, bureau, commission, division, department, officer, agency, authority or instrumentality of
any government, and that name designation is incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective
date of that ordinance or subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties or liabilities placed with
that entity are or were transferred to a different entity; then the named board, bureau, commission,
department, division, officer, agency, authority or instrumentality, whether correctly named in the
ordinance at its effective date or not, means that correctly named entity, or the entity to which the
duties, liabilities, powers and rights were transferred.
(I.C. 1-1-6-1)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any words; the omission of
any word or words necessary to express the intention of the provisions affected; the use of a word
or words to which no meaning can be attached; or the use of a word or words when another word
or words was clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the manifest intention, and the
provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the
nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 REASONABLE TIME.
(A) In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in a reasonable time or
requires reasonable notice to be given, “reasonable time or notice” shall be deemed to mean the
time which is necessary for a prompt performance of the act or the giving of the notice.

holiday, it shall be excluded.
§ 10.11 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.
When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section or law adopted prior
to the enactment of this code, the former section or law is not revived unless it so expressly
provides. The repeal of any section shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or
liability incurred under the section, unless the repealing section so expressly provides. The
section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of sustaining any proper action
or prosecution for the enforcement of the penalty, forfeiture or liability.
(I.C. 1-1-5-1)
§ 10.12 LIMITATION PERIODS.
The running of any period of limitations or any requirement of notice contained in any law,
whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or to the prosecution of offenses, or for the
recovery of penalties and forfeitures, contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code, shall
not be affected by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings, and prosecutions for
causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date of this code may be commenced and
prosecuted with the same effect as if this code had not been enacted.
Statutory reference: Periods of limitation, see I.C. 1-1-1-7

shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of this code, the proper number of the chapter or
section. In addition to an indication thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a

§ 10.16 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of this code shall be
prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws. This code does not affect any rights
or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this
code. The liabilities, proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In particular, any agreement
granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way, contracts entered into or franchises granted,
the acceptance, establishment or vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate officers

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY
§ 32.50 GENERAL INFORMATION.
(A) The fixed asset policy for the City of Hobart is being issued effective on the date duly
adopted and published herein. The new policy will be referred to as the “Capital Asset Policy”.
This policy is being issued to document the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on our
financial reports and to include infrastructure assets. This issuance of a policy document is related
to the implementation of a new reporting model, Governmental Accounting Standards Board
Statement 34. Statement 34 will require the city to depreciate capital assets. The capital asset
threshold will be $5,000. An asset with a value under $5,000 will be expensed in the year of
purchase. The infrastructure portion of this policy is also effective on the date duly adopted and
published.
(B) City utilities will follow this same definition of capital assets. Any item with a unit cost
of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized. Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000) are
expensed in the year of acquisition.
(C) The City of Hobart has established a capital asset policy in order to provide a higher
degree of control over its considerable investment in capital assets, and to be able to demonstrate
accountability to its various constituencies: citizens, rate-payers, oversight bodies and regulators.
All public information pertaining to capital assets will be made available in the Annual City &
Town Financial Report (CTAR).
(D) The purpose of establishing a capital policy is fivefold:
(1) To safeguard the investments of the citizens of Hobart;
(2) To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;
(3) To provide a basis for formulating capital asset acquisition, maintenance and
retirement policies;
(4) To provide date for financial reporting; and
(5) To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility for public assets.
(E) This policy will only serve to classify capital assets, including fixed and infrastructure,
for accuracy in financial reporting through the Indiana State Board of Accounts. It does not
include date processing, programming requirements or computer operations procedures.
(Ord. 2004-38; Ord. 2006-39, § 1)
§ 32.51 DEFINITION.
For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply unless the context
Hobart - Administration
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 32 / Page 14 Title III
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
CAPITAL ASSETS.
(1) Include: land, land improvements, including monuments, buildings, building
improvements, construction in progress, machinery and equipment, vehicles and infrastructure.
All land will be capitalized, but not depreciated. All items with a useful life of more than 1 year,
and having a unit cost of $5,000 or more shall be capitalized (including acquisitions by leasepurchase
agreements and donated items). A capital asset meeting the criteria will be reported and
depreciated in the government wide financial statements.
(2) Assets that are not capitalized (items less than $5,000) are expensed in the year of
acquisition. An inventory will be kept on all computers and other equipment with a capitalized
cost of less than $5,000.
(3) Exceptions are:
(a) Items costing less that the above limits which are permanently installed as a
part of the cost of original construction or installation of a larger building or equipment unit will
be included in the cost of the larger unit;
(b) Modular equipment added subsequent to original equipment construction of a
larger building or equipment unit which may be put together to form larger units costing more
than the prescribed limits will be charged to capital assets though the cost of individual items is
less than such units; and
(c) Cabinets, shelving, bookcases and similar items, added subsequent to original
construction, which are custom made for a specific place and adaptable elsewhere, will be
capitalized.
(4) Purchases made using grant funds must comply with grant requirements of the
above procedures, whichever are the most restrictive.
(5) Threshold levels for capital assets: The following schedule will be followed for the
different types of capital assets other than infrastructure assets:
Capitalize/Depreciate
Land All/capitalize only
Land improvements $5,000
Building $5,000
Building improvements $5,000
Construction in progress All/capitalize only
Machinery and equipment $5,000
Vehicle $5,000
Utility assets $5,000
(6) Infrastructure:
(a) At the network level, the asset will be classified as major if the cost of the
network item is at least 10% of the cost of all capital assets in fiscal year 1999. A NETWORK
Funds and Other Finances
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 32 / Page 15 Title III
will be defined as a group of similar assets that serve a particular function or purpose for the City
of Hobart.
(b) At the subsystem level, the asset will be classified as major if the cost of the
subsystem item is at least 5% of the cost of all capital assets in fiscal year 1999. A SUBSYSTEM
will be defined as a segment of a network of assets that serve a similar function for the City of
Hobart.
(Ord. 2004-38)
§ 32.52 VALUATION.
(A) Capital assets much be recorded at actual cost. Normally, the cost recorded is the
purchase price or construction costs of the asset, but also included is any other reasonable and
necessary costs incurred to place the asset in its intended location and intended use. The costs
could include the following:
(1) Legal and title fees, closing costs;
(2) Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;
(3) Damage payments;
(4) Land preparation costs, demolition costs;
(5) Architect, engineering and accounting fees;
(6) Insurance premiums during construction;
(7) Transportation charges; and
(8) Interest costs during construction.
(B) Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at their fair market value on the date
donated.
(Ord. 2004-38)
§ 32.53 ASSET DEFINITIONS BY MAJOR CATEGORY.
(A) It is important to the maintenance of accurate records that each asset category be
precisely defined and that all persons responsible for records maintenance be fully aware of the
categorization system.
(B) This section further clarifies the asset definitions by major category.
(1) Land. LAND is defined as specified land, lots, parcels or acreage including rightsof-
way and easements, owned by the City of Hobart, its various departments, boards or
authorizes, regardless of the method or date of acquisition. Easements will not be included as the
city does not own them, but as an interest in land owned by another (i.e. property owner) that
entitles its holder to a specified limited use.
Hobart - Administration
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 32 / Page 16 Title III
(2) Improvements other than buildings. Examples of city assets in this category are
walks, parking areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains, planters, underground
sprinkler systems and other similar items.
(3) Buildings.
(a) All structures designed and erected to house equipment services, or functions
are included. This includes systems, services and fixtures within the buildings, and attachments
such as porches, stairs, fire escapes, canopies, areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles and all other
such units that serve the building.
(b) Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating, cooling ventilating and air
handling systems, alarm systems, sound systems, surveillance systems, passenger and freight
elevators, escalators, built-in casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed shelving, and other
fixed equipment are included with the building if owned. Communication antennas and/or towers
are not included as buildings. These are parts of the equipment units that they serve.
(4) Equipment. Equipment includes all other types of physical property within the
scope of the fixed asset management system not previously classified. Included within this
category are office mechanical equipment, office furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery
items, maintenance equipment, communication equipment, Police, Fire, Sanitation and Park
Department, laboratory equipment, vehicles, road equipment, aircraft, emergency equipment,
earth moving equipment, text equipment, civil defense equipment and data processing equipment.
All supplies are excluded.
(5) Infrastructure.
(a) Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally can be
preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital assets and that are
normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads, streetlights, traffic signals, sewer lines and
drainage systems. Infrastructure assets do not include buildings, drives, parking lots or any other
examples given above that are incidental to property or access to the property above.
(b) Additions and improvements to infrastructure, which increase the capacity or
efficiency of the asset, will be capitalized. Maintenance/repairs will be considered as necessary to
maintain the existing asset, and therefore not capitalized. For example, patching, resurfacing,
snow removal and the like, are considered maintenance activities and will be expensed. Also,
normal department operating activities such as feasibility studies, and preliminary engineering
and design, will be expensed and not capitalized as an element of the infrastructure asset.
(c) Alleys will not be included as part of infrastructure for the following reasons.
1. Existing improved alleys will be maintained, and the city is responsible
only for the maintenance, such as patching and repairing. Any investments to upgrade the alleys
will be done by homeowner participation. Therefore, the city will not track and value alleys, and
the patching/repairs will be expensed as they occur.
2. The retroactive reporting requirements for infrastructure of GASB 34
requires the city to report items put into service from 1980 forward, and gives the city the option
to report items put into service prior to 1980. The city will report only on items put into service
Funds and Other Finances
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 32 / Page 17 Title III
after 1980. Retroactive reporting is not mandated until fiscal years beginning after January 1,
2007, which the city will comply with.
(Ord. 2004-38)
§ 32.54 DEPRECIATION METHODS.
(A) Generally. The city will be depreciating capital assets by using either composite/group
method depreciation or the straight-line method. Salvage value will be determined on an asset-byasset
basis. Depreciation will be calculated at year-end. Land is not depreciated according to
general accepted accounting principles.
(B) Composite/group network.
(1) Composite depreciation refers to calculating depreciation for a collection of similar
assets. A single composite rate is applied annually to the acquisition cost of the collection as a
whole. At year-end, an adjustment will be made to the total cost to account for any
additions/disposals throughout the year. The accumulated depreciation associated with it will also
be adjusted. A gain or loss will never be reported on the asset when using the composite method.
A full year’s depreciation will be taken when the asset is placed in service and no depreciation
recorded in the year it is sold or disposed of. To determine the appropriate depreciation rate for
the composite group, divide 1 by the number of years the assets are depreciated. For instance, a
group of assets with a 25-year life will be depreciated at 4% each year (1/25).
(2) Following is the list of groups the city will use for depreciation:
(a) Composite/group depreciation.
1. Street lights: 35 years;
2. Traffic signals: 25 years;
3. Flood walls/gates: 50 years; and
4. Roads:
a. Cement: 10 years;
b. Gravel: 15 years;
c. Concrete: 30 years;
d. Asphaltic concrete: 20 years; and
e. Brick or stone: 50 years.
(b) Straight-line depreciation.
1. All assets accounted for under the capital asset policy will be depreciated
using the straight-line method of depreciation. A gain or loss on disposal will be recorded.
Following is a list of the most common useful lives:

A physical inventory of all capital assets (any item over $5,000) will be conducted in each
department on or about December 31 of every year. The Clerk-Treasurer’s Office will conduct
spot checks on a random basis. Department heads will be accountable for the capital asset
inventory charged to their departments by verifying a list of their capital assets at year end.
(Ord. 2004-38)
§ 32.58 RESPONSIBILITIES OF CLERK-TREASURER’S OFFICE.
The Fiscal Officer will ensure that accounting for capital assets is being exercised by
establishing a capital asset inventory, both initially and periodically in subsequent years. The

additions, retirements, and transfers and to reflect the new, annual capital asset balance for
financial reporting purposes and the annual and accumulated depreciation calculation.
(Ord. 2004-38)
§ 32.59 RESPONSIBILITIES OF DEPARTMENT HEADS.
(A) It is the responsibility of the department heads to act as or designate a steward for each

process.
(B) Someone should be designated to record the receipt of the asset, to examine the asset to
Funds and Other Finances
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 32 / Page 21 Title III
make sure that no damage was incurred during shipment and to make sure that the asset was
received in working order.
(C) The steward is also responsible for arranging for the necessary preventative
maintenance and any needed repairs to keep the asset in working condition. It is necessary to
have a responsible person available for questions that arise during a physical inventory or when
someone wants to borrow the asset. The steward ensures that the asset is used for the purpose for
which it was acquired and that there is no personal or unauthorized use. In addition, the steward
should report any property damage or theft.

officials shall perform their duties for the benefit of the citizens of the city. They shall conduct the
government of the city with loyalty, integrity and impartiality and without prejudice or favoritism
and without the opportunity of personal gain to influence their decisions or actions or to interfere
with serving the public interest. The purpose of this policy is to establish legal and ethical
standards of conduct for all elected and appointed officials of the city and to require disclosures
by all elected and appointed officials of private, financial or other interests in matters that may
affect the city.
(Ord. 2003-41)

petition.
(Ord. 2003-41)
§ 33.044 FINANCIAL OR PERSONAL INTEREST DISCLOSURE.
(A) No official, either on that person’s behalf or on behalf of any other person, shall have
any financial or personal interest in any business or transaction with the Common Council, board,
commission, committee or public body of the city unless that official makes any full public
disclosure of the nature and extent of such interest, and if required, disqualifies himself or herself
from participating in and acting upon the resolution of the business or transaction; provided,
however, at any such hearing the presiding officer of the Common Council, board, commission,
committee or other public body of the city, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may direct
questions to the official who has an interest in the matter to clarify the evidence upon which the
public body will make its decision. In the event the conflict of interest of the individual is ethical
and not a violation of state law and the Common Council, board, commission, committee or other
public body requires the individual to cast a vote in order to carry out required official business of
Hobart - Administration
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 3 3 / Page 6 Title III
the city, the individual shall fully disclose the matter of conflict before casting a vote.
(B) If an official has a potential conflict of interest, a written conflict of interest public
disclosure form shall be filed by that person with the Clerk-Treasurer prior to the occurrence of
the business or transaction and/or prior to consideration by the Common Council, a board,
commission or committee of the issue. The conflict of interest public disclosure form shall then
be scheduled for review at the next public meeting of the Common Council, board, commission
or committee of which that individual is a member. The official making the disclosure shall swear
or affirm to the written disclosures with an appropriate statement that the disclosure is a true,
accurate and complete statement of his or her interests.
(C) If a potential conflict of interest that otherwise was not anticipated, involving an elected
official, or a board, commission or committee member arises while a meeting is underway, that
member shall declare that a conflict may or does exist and shall immediately disqualify himself or
herself from participating and acting on that matter; provided, however, at any such hearing or
meeting the presiding officer of the Common Council, a board, commission or committee, unless
otherwise prohibited by law, may direct questions to the official who has an interest in the matter
to clarify the evidence upon which the public body will make its decision.
(D) If an individual covered by this policy is unsure as to the existence or non-existence of a
conflict of interest, that individual may seek an advisory opinion. Requests originating from
members of the Common Council or appointed boards, commissions or committees shall be
forwarded through the presiding officer of that body to the city’s Attorney. Requests from the
Clerk-Treasurer shall be submitted to the city’s Attorney. Requests from the city’s Attorney shall
be submitted to the President of the Common Council. Requests for such advisory opinions shall
be initiated on a timely basis. The opinions rendered shall be advisory only, and shall not serve to
exempt or excuse any official from fully conforming to this policy, or applicable penal or civil
statutes, ordinances and regulations. The city’s Attorney shall give prompt notice of his or her
receipt of any such request to the President of the Common Council.

acceptance of the gift when possible. For elected officials, the disclosure shall be made to the

NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH RELATIVES OF ELECTED OFFICIALS
§ 33.052 FINDING.
The Council finds that it is necessary and desirable to adopt a policy of conduct with regard
to nepotism in employment with the City and in contracting with the City in order to continue to
be able to provide local government services to its residents and to comply with new laws
effective July 1, 2012 known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and 21, respectively.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)
§ 33.053 NEPOTISM POLICY ON EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRACTING.
On July 1, 2012, the City shall have a Nepotism Policy on Employment and Contracting that
complies with the minimum requirements of I.C. 36-1-20.2 as to Nepotism in City employment,
and with I.C. 36-1-21as to Contracting with the City by a Relative. Implementation of such
policies shall begin and continue thereafter.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)
§ 33.054 ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICY.
The City of Hobart Nepotism Policy on Employment and Contracting is hereby established
and effective as of July 1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-
20.2 as to Nepotism in employment, and the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-21 as
to contracting with the City by a relative. Said minimum requirements shall include all future
supplements and amendments to said statutes which become law from time to time, and making
them a part hereof as if fully set out herein. A copy of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and 21 are attached. The
City determines that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and 21 specifically allow the City to adopt requirements
Hobart - Administration
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 3 3 / Page 10 Title III
that are “more stringent or detailed” and that more details at this time are not necessary.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)
§ 33.055 SINGLE MEMBERS OF LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNING BODIES.
The City finds that a single member of the legislative body of the City cannot act for the
body to make work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body and therefore without such authority
by the majority, he or she will not be in the direct line of supervision. (See I.C. §§36-4-6-11 and
36-5-2-9-4). In addition, the City finds that a single member of governing bodies with authority
over employees in the City cannot act for the governing body to make work assignments,
compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority of a
majority of the body, when a statute provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore,
without such authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)
§ 33.056 OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES TO COMPLY; SANCTIONS.
All elected and appointed officials and employees of the City are hereby directed to
cooperate fully in the implementation of the policy created by this Ordinance and in
demonstrating compliance with same. Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the City Policy on Nepotism in Employment and
Contracting is a violation of the Policy and may result in discipline, including termination,
transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the City who fails to abide by or cooperate with the implementation, with the
compliance and with mandated certifications of said Policy may be subject to action allowed by
law.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)
§ 33.057 IMPLEMENTATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF POLICY.
The policy created by this Ordinance is directed to be implemented by any one or more than
one of the following actions:
(A) posting a copy of this Ordinance in its entirety in at least one of the locations in the
City also used to post employer posters or other notices to employees;
(B) providing a copy of this Ordinance to its employees and elected and appointed
officials;
(C) providing or posting a notice of the adoption of this Ordinance; or
(D) any such other action or actions that would communicate the policy established by this
Ordinance to its employees and elected and appointed officials.
Upon taking any of the above-described actions, the policy is deemed to have been
implemented by the City. Two (2) copies of I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21, and as
City Policies
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 33 / Page 11 Title III
supplemented or amended, shall be maintained on file in the Office of the City Clerk-Treasurer
for the purpose of public inspection as may be required by I.C. §36-1-5-4.
(Ord. 2012-14, § 1)

bidder to remove the subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and
responsible subcontractor.
The disclosure of a subcontractor (“Disclosed Subcontractor”) by a bidder or a subcontractor
shall not create any rights in the Disclosed Subcontractor. Thus, a bidder and/or subcontractor
may substitute another subcontractor (“Substitute Subcontractor”) for a Disclosed Subcontractor
by giving the City written notice of the name, address, and type of work of the Substitute
Subcontractor. The Substitute Subcontractor is subject to all of the obligations of a subcontractor
under this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.202 VALIDITY OF PRE-QUALIFICATION CLASSIFICATION.
Upon designation by the City that a contractor’s or subcontractor’s submission in
anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and upon any further consideration deemed
Hobart - Administration
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 3 3 / Page 24 Title III
necessary by the City, the contractor or subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future City public
works projects. A contractor’s classification as “qualified” shall exempt the contractor or
subcontractor from the comprehensive submission requirement contained herein for the
remainder of the calendar year. Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are pre-qualified
must submit a complete application for continuation of “pre-qualified” standing, on a form
provided by the City, (also referred to as the “short form”) by December 31st for the upcoming
calendar year. Failure by any pre-qualified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its
complete application for continuation of “pre-qualified” standing shall result in automatic
removal of the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year. However, the “removed”
contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on City public works projects by
including the required documents with their bid.
Any material changes to the contractor’s status, at any time, must be reported in writing
within ten (10) days of its occurrence to the City. The pre-qualification designation is solely
within the discretion of the City and the City specifically reserves the right to change or revoke
the designation for a stated written reason(s).
Denial of pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded to the contractor within
seven (7) working days of such decision. Any contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status
may request reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in writing to the City
within five (5) business days of receipt of notice of denial.
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.203 INCOMPLETE SUBMISSIONS BY BIDDERS.
It is the sole responsibility of the potential bidder to comply with all submission
requirements applicable to the bidder in §33.200 above by no later than the public bid opening.
Post-bid submissions must be submitted in accordance with §33.201 above. Submissions deemed
inadequate, incomplete, or untimely by the City may result in the automatic disqualification of the
bid.
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.204 RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER DETERMINATION.
The City, after review of complete and timely submissions, shall, in its sole discretion, after
taking into account all information in the submission requirements, determine whether a bidder is
responsive and responsible. The City specifically reserves the right to utilize all information
provided in the contractor or subcontractor’s submission or any information obtained by the City
through its own independent verification of the information provided by the contractor.
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.205 CERTIFIED PAYROLL.
For projects in which the estimated cost is at least $250,000 the successful bidder and all
subcontractors working on a public work project shall submit a certified payroll report utilizing
the federal form now known as WH-347 which must be prepared on a weekly basis and submitted
to the City within ten (10) calendar days after the end of each week in which the bidder or
subcontractor performed its work on the public work project. These certified payroll reports shall
City Policies
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 33 / Page 25 Title III
identify the job title and craft of each employee on the project, e.g. journeyman electrician or
apprentice electrician. In the event any contractor or subcontractor uses independent contractors
to perform work on the project, such individual must be identified on the WH-347 form with the
same information as is required for employees.
The City may withhold payment due for work performed by a bidder if the bidder fails to
timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such certified payroll reports are
submitted. The City may also withhold payment due for work performed by a subcontractor if
the subcontractor fails to timely submit its certified payroll reports until such time as such
certified payroll reports are submitted. The City shall not withhold payment to a bidder for work
performed by the bidder or for work performed by subcontractors who have submitted their
certified payroll reports, because one or more other subcontractors failed to timely submit their
certified payroll reports.
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.206 PUBLIC RECORDS.
All information submitted by a bidder or a subcontractor pursuant to this Ordinance,
including certified payrolls, are public records subject to review pursuant to the Indiana Access to
Public Records Act (I.C. §5-24-3-1, et seq.).
(Ord. 2015-28)
§ 33.207 PENALTIES FOR FALSE, DECEPTIVE OR FRAUDULENT STATEMENTS.
Any bidder that willfully makes, or willfully causes to be made, a false, deceptive or
fraudulent statement, or willfully submits false, deceptive or fraudulent information in connection
with any submission made to the City shall be disqualified from bidding on all City projects for a
period of three years and shall be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $2,500.00 for each
false, deceptive or fraudulent statement or submitted information.

other and which are owned by the same person or entity;
(4) Commercial and industrial properties.

month per unit served. Eligible residential garbage collection customers age 65 or over shall be
assessed a reduced flat rate amount of $6.00 per month once application is made for the reduction
and eligibility is established. Residents may qualify for the reduced monthly fee by applying for
such reduction through the office of the Clerk-Treasurer providing proof of ownership and
residency at a property and proof of age. Rates are to be added to the Fee Schedule of the
Municipal Code. The fees established herein shall be increased by three percent (3%) effective
January 1, 2010 and each January 1 thereafter.
(C) The rates and charges for all units shall be prepared and billed monthly and collected by
the City in the manner provided by law and ordinance.
(D) The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties
served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such billing shall in no way
relieve the owner from the liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The
owners of the properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the City for the purpose of determining whether bills have been
paid by such tenant or tenants and such examination shall be made at the office at which such
records are kept and during the regular business hours of such office.
(E) As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid by the 10th day of the month
following receipt are hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
amount of the rate or charges shall thereupon attach thereto.
(Ord. 2008-36, § 1)

§ 52.24 ASSESSMENT OF PRO-RATA SHARE.
(A) If 70% or more of the benefitted property owners contiguous to the route of the
proposed water main extension are favorable to paying the pro-rata share, then payment shall be
mandatory for all benefitted property owners contiguous to the route.
(B) If fewer than 70% of the benefitted property owners contiguous to the route of the
proposed water main extension are favorable to paying the pro-rata share, then payment shall be
voluntary for all benefitted property owners contiguous to the route. Under this condition, the city
shall pay no amount toward the project.
(C) If payment of the pro-rata share is mandatory, the Board of Public Works and Safety on
a case by case basis shall determine the method of assessment used in order to raise the amount
not paid by the city. Since each water request is unique, the Board of Public Works and Safety
shall determine the method of mandatory assessment at the time the project moves to the top of
the priority list.
(D) The methods used for the assessment may include the following:
(1) Per foot of frontage along the route of the main;
(2) Per improved property, equal assessment;
(3) Per area of each lot served;
(4) Estimated consumption; and
(5) Any combination of the above.
(E) Lots separated from the water main by easements or rights-of-way shall be considered
contiguous for purposes of assessment.
(F) Properties with multiple contiguous frontages shall be assessed based on the average lot
dimension of the 2 contiguous frontages.
(G) In addition to being responsible for the pro-rata share for the water main extension
installation, each benefitted property owner shall be responsible for paying all costs associated
with the connection from the water main to the private facility intending to use water.
(H) In the case of extreme financial hardship as determined by the Board of Public Works
and Safety, the pro-rata share for the water main installation may be paid to the city by
installment payments. The owners of a benefitted property seeking installment payments must file
with the Clerk-Treasurer an application for installment payments which shall include verification
that the benefitted property owners lack available funds to pay the pro-rata share in a lump sum.
The application shall be reviewed by the Clerk-Treasurer for sufficiency. If the application for
installment payments is approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety, all owner of record
shall execute a promissory note and recordable real estate mortgage securing payment of the
promissory note using the benefitted real property as security for payment. The promissory note
shall be for a term no longer than 48 months and shall be at an annual interest rate equal to 8%
per annum.

defined in this chapter.
(10) Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or
reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to a
degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
(C) (1) If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
division (B) above, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(a) Require new industries or industries with significant increase in discharges to
submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior approval for discharges;
(b) Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate by
the city;
(c) Require pretreatment of the wastes to within the limits of normal sewage, as
defined;
(d) Require control of flow equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any “slug”
loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works; or
(e) Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and treating
the wastes.
(2) If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of
the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

(D) Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner
at his or her expense.
(E) When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with the
necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained by him
or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Agents of the city, the state water pollution
control agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.
(F) All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which
reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
Standard Methods of the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at the control manhole, except for application for NPDES permits and
report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
USEPA and any subsequent revisions subject to approval by the city. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall
be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular
analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
suspended solids analysis are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
(G) No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial
waste or unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to
payment therefore, by the industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible herewith.

wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner,
by such method and at such times as the city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times.
(B) Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical oxygen
demand of 170 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in excess of 200 milligrams per

relieve the owner from the liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The
owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills have been
paid by the tenant or tenants; provided that, the examination shall be made at the office at which

maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the
wastewater treatment systems.
(B) Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time following the normal
accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the
fairness and equity of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of certified public
accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such studies,

of his or her home, or elsewhere, who is in reasonable apprehension of the infliction of physical
harm upon him or her by another person or animal, commands, shouts at, beats, kicks or
otherwise compels the dog to attack. An attack is deemed to be provoked by another domestic
animal when such animal bites, scratches or otherwise inflicts physical injury, no matter how
slight, upon the dog.

animal within the meaning and intent of subsection (A) of this section shall be strictly liable for

grounds thereof, and demanding that a certified transcript of the record and of all papers on file in
the office of the Commission affecting or relating to such judgment or order, be filed by the
Commission with such court. The commission shall, within 10 days, after the filing of such
notice, make, certify and file such transcript with such court. The circuit court shall thereupon
proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner: provided, however, that such
hearing be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge,

from the issuance of the initial permit for construction. The grantee and the municipality may

franchise agreement.
(B) Line extensions.
(1) In areas of the franchise territory not initially served, a grantee shall be required to
extend its system pursuant to the following requirements.
(a) No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. To expedite the process of
extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the municipality will forward to the grantee an
approved engineering plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall
commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan. Upon
notification from the municipality that the first home in the project has been approved for a
building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of 3 months to complete the
construction/activation process within the applicable project phase, barring any unforeseen
adverse weather or ground conditions.
(b) Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a grantee must make cable
service available to every unserved structure within the franchise area. The grantee shall extend
service to any annexed areas according to the following schedule:
1. For areas of territory annexed to the city of 5 acres or more, the grantee
shall extend service to such areas within 3 months of the date of annexation; or
2. For those areas of less than 5 acres, the grantee shall extend service to

date of a franchise agreement, the grantee shall extend service to the areas within 12 months for
areas of less than 5 acres and within 18 months for areas of 5 acres or more.
(c) The grantee shall extend and make cable service available to any isolated
resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if
the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard 125-foot drop line.
(2) The franchising authority may contract with owners of real property for the
installation of cable service and the construction of cable system lines within the municipality or
within 1-1/2 miles in order to provide service for the area in which the real property of the owners
is located. The contract must provide, for a term not to exceed that agreed upon between the
grantee and the franchising authority in a franchise agreement, for the payment to the owners and
their assigns by any owner of real property who:
(a) Did not contribute to the original cost of the wiring of cable service to the area
in which the real property of the owners is located; and
(b) Subsequently obtains a subscription for cable service and is served by the
wiring of cable service to the area in which the real property of the owners is located; of a prorata
share of the cost of the construction of the cable system subject to the conditions of this
chapter, the franchise agreement, and applicable law and notwithstanding any other law relating
Hobart – Business Regulations
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 18 Title XI
to the functions of local government entities. However, the contract does not apply to any owner
of real property who is not a party to it unless it has been recorded in the office of the recorder of
Lake County before the owner has received installation of the cable system. The franchising
authority may provide that the pro-rata share of the cost of construction include interest at a rate
not exceeding the amount of interest allowed on judgments, and the interest shall be computed
from the date that the extension of the cable system was approved by the franchising authority to
the date payment is made to the municipality.
1. The contract must include, as part of the consideration running to the
municipality, the release of the right of the parties to the contract and their successors in title to
remonstrate against pending or future annexations of the municipality of the area served by the
cable system. Any person who is connected to the cable system and receives cable service
contracted for is considered to waive his or her rights to remonstrate against the annexation of the
area served by the cable system. The aforementioned does not apply if the costs of extension of or
connection to the cable system are paid by a person other than the landowner or the municipality.
This section shall apply when:
a. Any part of the cost of a cable system is to be assessed against the
owners of real property;
b. The proposed cable system is to be connected into the cable system
referenced under this chapter or a franchise agreement; and
c. The owners did not contribute to the cost of the extension of the
cable system.
2. There shall be included in the grantee’s estimate submitted to the
franchising authority and the assessments, a sum equal to the amount provided in or computed
from the contract as the fair pro-rata share due from the owners upon and for the contracted
extension of the cable system, including any interest owed. The sum included in the grantee’s
estimate must be separately itemized.
(3) In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be
placed underground, all cable system facilities also shall be placed underground, except as
otherwise specifically approved in advance by the municipality. In the event that the grantee
receives notice of such new construction or property development, including the date on which
open trenching is available for the grantee’s work (the “notice”), then the grantee shall provide, to
the developer or property owner and to the municipality, the specifications for its trenching and
the grantee shall install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within 5 working days after
the trenches first become available to the grantee for the work. Costs of trenching and easements
required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner;
provided, however, that, if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals
within the 5 working days, then the cost of any new trenching, and easements if necessary, shall
be borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to the grantee at the address stated in the
franchise agreement or to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee. Written or
oral notice from the developer, property owner or municipality shall be sufficient to qualify as the
notice.
(C) Prevention of grantee from serving areas of service. Nothing herein shall be construed
to prevent the grantee from serving areas of the service area not covered under this section upon
agreement with developers, property owners, residents or businesses; provided that, all applicable
Cable Television
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 19 Title XI
fees are paid by the grantee to the municipality therefor, including without limitation the
franchise fee provided in this chapter, as may be amended from time to time.
(D) Proposal of line extension policy. A grantee, in its new or renewal application, may
propose a line extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the service area than
as required above, in which case the grantee’s policy will be incorporated into the franchise
agreement and will be binding on the grantee.
(E) Violation. Any violation of this section shall be considered a violation of this chapter
for which the provisions of either §§ 113.056 or 113.999 shall apply, as determined by the
municipality.
(Ord. 2000-06, § 21)
§ 113.039 CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS.

Hobart – Business Regulations
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 20 Title XI
for emergency radio services to prove and verify that no interference signal combinations are
possible which may disrupt municipal public works, police, fire or administrative
communications, or township, county or state communications. Stray radiation shall be measured
adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation radio sites to prove no interference to airborne
navigational reception in the normal flight patterns. All applicable FCC rules and regulations

accordance with the National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code, as now or
hereafter amended. The grantee shall also comply with any local ordinance pertaining to the
establishment of electrical grounding standards, and with any additional grounding standards
established by electric and telephone companies if the grantee has arranged to lease pole space
from the companies. In the event that the grantee has erected wiring and related appurtenances
upon poles owned by private parties other than electric or telephone companies, the grantee shall

(9) In all areas of the municipality where the cables, wires and other like facilities of
public utilities are placed underground, all cables, wires and other like facilities of the grantee
installed after the effective date of the grantee’s franchise shall be placed underground. When
public utilities relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee shall concurrently do
so at no expense to the municipality.
(10) Where the grantee places cabling underground as part of a relocation of cabling, or
as an element of new construction or reconstruction of the cable system, the grantee shall utilize
directional boring wherever possible.
(C) Plans and permits.
(1) Right to review; briefings.
(a) The municipality shall have the right to review the grantee’s construction
plans and specifications prior to the commencement of any new construction to assure
compliance with the standards specified in this chapter and to inspect all aspects of cable system
construction. The municipality shall not, however, be required to review or approve the plans and
specifications or to make the inspections and the municipality specifically disclaims the
obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps necessary to assure
compliance with the standards and to ensure that the cable system is installed in a safe manner
and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
(b) Before beginning new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, the
grantee’s chief engineer or designated individual shall meet with the municipal administrator,
manager or designated individual to provide and explain the grantee’s construction plans and
work program in detail. Similar briefings shall be held from time to time as deemed necessary by
either the municipality or the grantee until the work is completed.

(2) “As-built” plans. The grantee shall, within 90 days after the effective date of its
franchise, furnish to the municipality complete “as-built” plans of the cable system and shall,

shall keep such as-built plans confidential to the extent allowable by law and shall show the plans
only to those employees, contractors or municipality officials who need to see them as a part of
their responsibilities to the municipality, or pursuant to their responsibilities for locating utilities.
Upon implementation of a municipal geographic information system (GIS), the grantee shall
provide the “as-built” plans in a digital format which is compatible to the computer systems of the
grantee and the municipality.
(3) Permits.
(a) The grantee shall obtain permits from the municipality before commencing
any new construction of or within the cable system, with specific permission being required for
the opening or disturbance of any public street or public way within the municipality. The permit
application shall include a plan drawn in sufficient detail to demonstrate to the municipality that
the cable system will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes and ordinances.
Where cable is to be installed on existing poles, the permit application shall include a drawing
showing the existing poles and additional poles, if requested.
(b) Without characterizing the violation of other provisions of this chapter, the
failure to obtain the permits shall constitute a material violation of this chapter. The grantee also,
before the commencement of new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, shall
become and remain a member of the J.U.L.I.E. system or the utility locating system serving Lake
County, Indiana (“Holey Moley”). The grantee may redact any information which it deems
proprietary.
(D) Workmanlike manner. All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance,
repair and removal of the cable system, or any part thereof, shall be performed in a workmanlike
manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the
municipality or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable
system, including without limitation any means used to distribute signals over or within the cable
system, is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then the grantee, at its sole cost and
expense, shall promptly correct all such conditions. Any contractor, subcontractor or other person
proposed to be employed for the installation, maintenance, relocation or repair of cable system
equipment or facilities shall be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and shall be
thoroughly experienced in the work for which he or she is retained.
(E) Compliance. The grantee shall, at all times, comply with the rules and regulations for
infrastructure specifications as found in Appendix A of Ord. 2000-06, the Model Cable
Television Franchise Ordinance and any and all rules and regulations enacted or to be enacted by
the municipality with reference to construction activity in public streets or public ways. All poles,
wires, conduits, cables, equipment, pipes, appurtenances, structures and other facilities of the
cable system shall be installed and located in compliance with all applicable municipal codes and
ordinances and the applicable provisions of the franchise so as to cause minimum interference
with the rights and reasonable convenience of the general public, all as determined by the
municipality in its sole and absolute discretion. Unless the municipality shall, in writing, waive its
right to review plans, no construction or other work relating to the facilities within the public
streets and public ways of the municipality shall be commenced until the municipality shall have
approved and issued a permit on the plans, specifications and methods for the work. Any such
Hobart – Business Regulations
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 22 Title XI
permit may be so conditioned or restricted as deemed necessary by the municipality to protect the
public health, safety and welfare. All such facilities shall at all times be kept and maintained in a
safe condition and in good order and repair.
(F) Location of pedestals and vaults.
(1) Pedestals and similar above ground appurtenances.
(a) The municipality has determined that pedestals and similar aboveground
appurtenances located on a public street or public way (other than in an alley or as provided in
division (F)(1)(c) below) or on public property will adversely affect the appearance of the
municipality and of the property therein and, accordingly, pursuant to § 541(a)(2) of the Cable
Act, the grantee shall not under any circumstances install or locate a pedestal or any similar above
ground appurtenance on any public street or public way (other than in an alley or as provided in
division (F)(1)(c) below) or on any public property as a part of any new construction or any
relocation or reinstallation.
(b) Pedestals or similar above ground appurtenances may be installed on private
property only with the express, prior written consent and permission of the affected property
owner or his or her authorized agent, or the duly elected or appointed representative of the
affected property; provided, however, that, the pedestals or above ground appurtenances shall
comply with all applicable provisions of the municipal code.
(c) Notwithstanding division (F)(1)(b) above, pedestals or similar above ground
appurtenances may be installed within certain utility easements on private property without the
consent or permission of the affected property owner; provided that:
1. The grantee is lawfully authorized to use such utility easement pursuant
to applicable state or federal law;
2. No such pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance may be installed
unless, at the time of the desired installation, there exists within the utility easement, a similar
above ground appurtenance of another utility company or entity;
3. The grantee’s pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance shall be
located as close as is practicable to the existing above ground appurtenance; and
4. In the event of an emergency, the grantee shall attempt to contact the
property owner or legal tenant in person and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event personal
contact is not made.
(2) Vaults.
(a) The grantee shall not install underground vaults on any public street or public
way after the effective date of this franchise, except in accordance with and pursuant to the
provisions of division (F)(2)(d) below. All underground vaults shall be flush mounted with the
surface of the land area.

an underground vault on the owner’s private property or on the public street or public way
(including, without limitation, the parkway) immediately adjacent to the owner’s property. The
notice shall be in writing, in form and substance acceptable to the municipal administrator or
manager and delivered by certified mail or personal delivery to the owner at least 30 days
immediately before the commencement of construction on or around the owner’s property.
(c) In the event that the owner elects to allow construction and installation of an
underground vault on the owner’s property, then the owner shall be required to grant the grantee
an easement, in form reviewed and approved by the municipality’s Attorney, allowing for the
construction and installation.
(d) In the event that the owner:
1. Elects not to allow construction and installation of an underground vault
on the owner’s property;
2. Fails to respond to the election notice delivered by the grantee pursuant
to division (F)(2)(b) above within 45 days after the owner receives the notice; or
3. Refuses to grant the grantee the easement pursuant to division (F)(2)(c)
above within 30 days after the owner’s receipt of an easement document, then the grantee shall be
entitled to construct and install an underground vault on the public way (including, without
limitation, the parkway) that is immediately adjacent to the owner’s property.
(G) Trenching requirements. The grantee shall excavate all trenches at a depth no less than
that required by the National Electrical Code for the installation of drop cable, feeder cable and
trunk cable. All open trenches in which work is being performed shall be covered at the end of
each working day, and when the trench is not occupied by a work crew, with a wooden covering
in a public way, or with a metal covering where work is being performed in a public street.
Coverings shall be adequately secured in order to prevent movement of the trench cover which
would expose the trench opening.

public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee
are just and reasonable.
(3) Where the municipality or a public utility serving the municipality desires to make
use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the
grantee cannot be reached, the municipality may require the grantee to permit such use for such
consideration and upon such terms as the municipality shall determine to be just and reasonable,
if the municipality determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not
unduly interfere with the grantee’s operations.

subsequently granted to any other person.
(G) If any public street or public way or portion thereof used by the grantee shall be vacated
by the municipality, or the use thereof is discontinued by the municipality or the grantee, during
the term of the franchise, then the grantee shall forthwith at its sole cost and expense remove its
facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted to continue to use the same and, on the removal
thereof, the grantee shall restore, repair, or reconstruct the public street or public way in
accordance with the specifications and requirements found in Appendix A of Ord. 2000-06, the
Model Cable Television Franchise Ordinance. In the event of any failure, neglect or refusal by the
grantee, after 30 days written notice from the municipality to repair, improve or maintain such
public street or public way, the municipality may, but shall be under no obligation to, conduct the
work, or cause it to be conducted, and the actual cost thereof shall be paid by the grantee in the
time and manner as directed by the municipality. Collection may be made by resort to the letter of
credit or cash security deposit established pursuant to § 113.031 of this chapter, or by court

addressed.
(C) When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence,
which, in the judgment of the municipality, in consultation with the grantee, casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the municipality shall have the right and authority to require
the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully
cooperate with the municipality in performing the testing and shall prepare results and a report, if
requested, within 30 days after notice. The report shall include the following information:

action identified in the report, the municipality determines that reasonable evidence still exists of
inadequate cable system performance, then the municipality may enlist an independent engineer
at the grantee’s expense to perform tests and analysis directed toward the suspected failures to
meet the requirements of this chapter. The grantee shall cooperate and permit the testing.
(E) The municipality shall require tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and
characteristics based on complaints or other evidence only when the municipality has reasonable
grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect

The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the
grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure
uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that, the rules,
regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable
state and federal laws, rules and regulations.

§ 113.046 FRANCHISE FEE.
(A) A grantee shall pay to the municipality a franchise fee of not less than 5% of the
grantee’s gross revenues or such other maximum amount as allowed by law.

taxes or other state, municipality or local taxes.
(C) The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on
a calendar year basis to the municipality within 30 days after the end of each quarter. The grantee

in excess of 4% of the applicable fee, then the grantee shall pay the full cost of the audit.
(2) The grantee shall maintain books and records of its operations within and related to
the municipality and the grantee’s cable system in sufficient detail to show gross revenue, by
service category, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. The books and records

before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at
an annual rate of 12%.
(F) The acceptance by the municipality of any franchise fee payment shall not in any way
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall the
acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim the municipality may have for
further or additional sums payable under the provisions of the franchise. All franchise fee
payments shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
(G) The grantee shall acknowledge as follows:
Cable Television
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 31 Title XI
(1) The franchise fee is not a tax;
(2) The franchise fee shall be in addition to any and all taxes, other applicable fees or
charges that the grantee or any affiliate shall be required to pay to the municipality or to any state
or federal agency or authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the
grantee and its affiliates;
(3) Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall have or make any claim for any
deduction or other credit of all or any part of the franchise fee from or against any of the
municipality taxes or other fees or charges that the grantee or any affiliate is required to pay to the
municipality except as may be identified and authorized by federal or state law;
(4) Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall apply or seek to apply all or any part of
the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit from or against any of the municipality taxes or
other fees or charges, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of the
grantee and its affiliates; and
(5) Except as authorized by applicable law, if the grantee or any affiliate applies or
seeks to apply all or any part of the amount of the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit
from or against any municipality tax or other fee or charge, or if the grantee or any affiliate
applies or seeks to apply all or any part of any such tax or other fee or charge as a deduction or
other credit from or against the franchise fee, then, in any such event, the action will be deemed a
violation of this chapter subject to the provisions of § 113.056 herein.
(H) The municipality may increase the franchise fee if and to the extent that the maximum
allowable franchise fee is increased by the FCC. If the municipality desires to increase the
franchise fee in that event, then the municipality shall provide at least 30 days written notice to
the grantee. If, within 30 days after the municipality’s notice, the grantee so requests, the
municipality shall conduct a public hearing on the franchise fee increase. The effective date of the
proposed franchise fee increase shall be delayed until the expiration of the 30-day notice period,
if within that period, the grantee does not request a hearing or, if a hearing is requested, until the
conclusion of the public hearing conducted pursuant to this division.
(Ord. 2000-06, § 29)
§ 113.047 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
(A) Except as provided in division (F) of this section below, a franchise shall not be
assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet, hypothecated or mortgaged, either in whole or in
part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or
property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written approval of the
municipality. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a parent or wholly
owned subsidiary of the grantee and the parent or subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise
back to the grantee without the consent; providing that, the assignment is without any release of
liability of the grantee. Any proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial
responsibility as determined by the municipality, and must agree, in writing, to comply with all
provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall submit a petition to the municipality requesting the
municipality’s approval at least 90 days before the grantee takes any action in furtherance of
accomplishing any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation or mortgage,
containing or accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC
Hobart – Business Regulations
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 113 / Page 32 Title XI
regulations and by the municipality. The municipality shall have 120 days to act upon any request
for approval of any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation or mortgage.
The municipality shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed assignment, transfer, pledge,
lease, sublet, hypothecation or mortgage if it fails to render a final decision within 120 days
following receipt of the petition and receipt of all necessary information as to the effect of the
proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation or mortgage upon the public,
unless the requesting party and the municipality agree to an extension of time. The municipality
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer and shall promptly notify grantee
of any action taken on such a request. Where the municipality deems to have found the petition to
be incomplete or requiring further information, the municipality shall request further information
from the grantee within 30 calendar days from the receipt of the petition.
(B) (1) The grantee shall promptly notify the municipality of any actual or proposed
change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the grantee. The word
“control”, as used herein, is not limited to major stockholders but also includes actual working
control in whatever manner exercised.
(2) A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon
the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons (excluding any parent or
subsidiary thereof) of 5% or more of the grantee or the franchise under which the cable system is
operated. Change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee without the municipality’s
consent shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the municipality shall
have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to the change, transfer or acquisition of control, the
municipality may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the municipality in the inquiry.
(C) The consent or approval of the municipality to any transfer of the grantee shall not
constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the municipality in and to any public street or public
way, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of
the franchise.
(D) In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the municipality shall not be required to
approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to substantial completion of
construction of the proposed system.
(E) In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the
successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement becoming a signatory to the franchise
agreement.
(F) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any assignment, pledge, lease,
sublease, mortgage or other transfer of all or any part of the grantee’s cable system, or any right
or interest therein, solely for financing purposes; provided that, each such assignment, pledge,
lease, sublease, mortgage or other transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the
municipality pursuant to this chapter, the franchise agreement and applicable law.
(Ord. 2000-06, § 30)

prepare in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and submit to the
municipality, a statement of gross revenues audited by a certified public accountant and covering
the grantee’s operations in and relating to the municipality and the grantee’s cable system.

grantee fails to do so, the municipality may perform the work at the grantee’s expense. Upon the
notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this
expense as determined by the municipality. In the event that the grantee is utilizing the plant of
the cable system for telecommunications services as defined by the Telecommunications Act of
1996, and the grantee’s franchise has been terminated, denied renewal or nullified due to
expiration, then the grantee shall not be required to remove its cable system plant. However, the

other communication facilities within or contiguous to the municipality. The interconnection shall
be negotiated by the municipality and the grantee. Upon receiving a request from the municipality
to so interconnect, the grantee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected
system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both
construction and operation of the interconnection link. The grantee may be granted reasonable
extensions of time to interconnect, or the municipality shall rescind its request to interconnect,
upon petition by the grantee to the municipality, if the grantee has negotiated in good faith and
has arrived at impasse with the operator or franchising authority of the system to be

interconnected, or that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or
unacceptable increase in subscriber rates, or that the interconnection is technically infeasible.
(3) The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional
interconnection authority, municipality or state or federal regulatory agency that may be hereafter
established for the purpose of regulating, financing or otherwise providing for the interconnection
of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the municipality.
(F) The grantee shall provide such additional services and facilities as are agreed upon

(A) Whenever the municipality determines that the grantee has violated any term, condition
or provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, and determines it appropriate to impose
monetary penalties, a written notice shall be given to the grantee informing it of the alleged
violation or liability. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation

notice subsequent to the date of the notice in which the grantee shall have the opportunity to cure
the violation before the municipality may impose penalties unless the violation is, in the opinion
of the municipality, of such a nature so as to require more than 30 days and the grantee proceeds,
immediately upon receipt of the notice, and continuously, and diligently, to cure the violation. In
any case where the violation is not cured within 30 days of notice from the municipality, or such
other time to which the grantee and the municipality may mutually agree, the municipality may
proceed to impose penalties and to exercise any other remedy provided in this chapter or the

§ 150.060 PERMIT; APPLICATION AND DURATION.
Building Regulations; Construction
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 150 / Page 15 Title XV
(A) No property owner shall commence construction or allow construction to commence
upon any project which requires the issuance of a Building Permit under §150.061 of the Code
prior to the issuance of such permit. Property Owners in violation of this subsection are subject
to prosecution and the imposition of a fine whether the work has been done by the property owner
or others. The fine shall be determined by the Board of Public Works and Safety, or the City
Court, and shall not exceed $1,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues. If
the work being performed without a Permit is being done by a Licensed Contractor, the
Contractor, and not the property owner, shall be liable for the fine or fines imposed.
Additionally, should a Licensed Contractor commence work on a project which requires the
issuance of a Building Permit under §150.061 of the Code prior to the issuance of such permit, or
should a Contractor fail to complete work before the Building Permit for the project expires, the
Building Commissioner may refer the contractor to the Contractors Licensing Board for
disciplinary review which may result in the imposition of an additional fine of up to $2,500 or the
revocation of the Contractor’s license, or both.
(B) Each Building Permit shall be issued with an expiration date shown prominently on the
face of the permit. The expiration date shall be one year from the permit application date unless
otherwise approved by the Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner may extend the
expiration date of a permit once during the life of the permit upon the Commissioner’s
determination of good cause.
(C) Should a Building Permit expire before all the work is completed on the project for
which the Permit was issued, work on the project shall cease until a new Permit is issued. Failure
to apply for a new permit for an incomplete project within seven (7) days of the expiration of the
initial permit may result in the imposition of a fine as determined by the Board of Public Works
and Safety, or the City Court, which shall not exceed $1,000 per day for each day during which
the violation continues. The replacement permit shall be a completely new permit with a new
expiration date and new fees that reflect the incomplete work covered by the new permit. Fees
paid on the expired permit shall not be credited toward the fee required for the new permit.
(D) Building Permits shall expire before their expiration date if work on the construction
project stops for a period of more than 180 days. Building Permits may be canceled by the
applicant at any time. The Building Permit expires if the Building Permit was obtained by a
Licensed Contractor and the Contractor’s License expires or is revoked before the work is
complete.
(E) Required inspections and any work required to correct violations found during such
inspections may be performed after the Building Permit for the inspected project has expired.
(F) Each person or entity applying for building permits for multi-family structures,
including, but not limited to, duplexes, 4-plexes and other such structures, shall provide, as part of
their submission, a plan describing how the solid waste for the occupants of the structures will be
managed, including reduction, reuse and recycling steps taken to reduce their waste stream, which
plan shall be subject to approval as provided hereunder.
(G) Each person or entity applying for building permits shall provide, as part of their
submission, a plan describing how the solid waste generated by the construction project will be
disposed of, which plan shall be subject to approval as provided hereunder.

furnished by the Building Department and all fees required by this code shall be paid to the City,
payable at the Clerk-Treasurer’s office. The City Building Official shall take into consideration

(A) The post-construction SWPPP shall include provisions for stormwater quality BMP(s)
that are designed to achieve the following design/performance objectives:
(1) Reduce total suspended solids (TSS) from the first flush as defined by land use
characteristics and contributing area; or, capture and treatment of at least 1/2-inch of precipitation
applied over the contributing area;
(2) Reduce or buffer increases in storm runoff temperature caused by contact with
impervious surfaces; and
(3) Hobart, Indiana reserves the right to require superceding or additional treatment
criteria or objectives for specific pollutant(s) as necessary to meet overall stormwater quality
management program objectives or directives under a watershed improvement or total maximum
daily load (TDML) program.
(B) Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to address the rate at which flow is
released over the entire runoff discharge period and the volume of discharge over the critical
design-storm period. The outlet structure shall be designed as a v-notch weir or other multiple
stage configurations capable of controlling the discharge rates for the 2-, 10- and 100-year
design-storm events.
(C) The guidance document(s), the Indiana Drainage Handbook or the Indiana Stormwater
Quality Manual, should be reviewed and considered when preparing the post-construction
SWPPP.
(D) Hobart, Indiana, reserves the right to develop or adopt other guidance documents to
serve as design and implementation standards. Other guidance documents distributed by the city
should be reviewed and considered when preparing the post-construction SWPPP. These
documents may be applied by Hobart, Indiana, as standards by which designs are to be prepared
and controls implemented. The city shall have authority to implement this chapter by appropriate
regulations, guidance or other related materials. In this regard, technical, administrative or
procedural matters may be modified as needed to meet the objectives defined herein, so long as
such modifications as to technical, administrative or procedural matters are not contrary or
beyond the intent of the objectives defined above.
(1) Regulations, guidance or other related materials that may be given authority by this
chapter may include, but are not limited to: best management practice (BMP) manuals, design
Hobart – Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 32 Title XV
regulations and requirements, submittal checklists, review checklists, inspection checklists,
certifications, stormwater management manuals and operation and maintenance manuals.
(2) Materials may include information deemed appropriate by the city including
guidance and specifications for the preparation of grading plans, selecting environmentally sound
practices for managing stormwater, minimum specifications and requirements, more complete
definitions and performance standards.
(3) The above referenced documents shall not in any way require specific
commercially available products. However, they may refer to performance specifications, class of
devices, construction or management practice.
(4) The above referenced documents may restrict or prevent the use of specific
products, techniques or management practices (that are to be accepted by the public or are
deemed to have a negative impact on public infrastructure or the MS4) that have been identified
as unacceptable for performance, maintenance or other technically based reasons.
(5) Documents referenced above may be updated periodically to reflect the most
current and effective practices and shall be made available to the public. However, the failure to
update the manual shall not relieve any applicant from the obligation to comply with this chapter,
and shall not prevent the city from imposing the most current and effective practices.
(E) Soil bioengineering, “green” and other “soft” slope and stream bank stabilization
methods shall receive preference over rip rap, concrete and other hard armoring techniques.
“Hard” alternatives shall only be permitted when their necessity can be demonstrated given sitespecific
conditions.
(F) Retention-supportive data must be submitted to justify the type of facility selected. If
the facility is designed to retain (volume control) all or a significant portion of runoff (as opposed
to temporarily detain), then appropriate soils analyses findings shall be submitted to the city. This
submission shall also discuss the impacts the facility will have on local karst topography as found
through a geotechnical investigation of the site. The facility may be designed to infiltrate runoff
to groundwater rather than transmit it downstream under conditions up to a 10-year storm event.
It must be able to bypass all other storms up to a 100-year event with a discharge rate equivalent
to or less than pre-development conditions without negatively impacting the 100-year floodplain
above or below the site. If data indicates that the facility can not retain a significant portion of the
runoff (95%) then the facility must be sized to detain runoff.
(G) Detention facilities may, and are encouraged to, be designed to serve multiple purposes.
For example, runoff may be detained under wet-weather conditions, but also serve as common or
recreational areas during dry-weather conditions. Where multi-purpose facilities are provided, or
where flat grades or poorly draining soils are encountered, provisions for adequate low-flow
stormwater management system may be required. Where the retention/detention facility is
planned to be used as a lake, pond or stormwater quality management practice with a permanent
pool, water budget calculations shall be performed and submitted to demonstrate that an adequate
pool is expected during dry summer months.
(H) A licensed, professional engineer shall stamp all proposed plans for construction. This
shall include all proposed improvements or modifications to existing or new stormwater
infrastructure and other related improvements or modifications.

required to continue inspections and maintenance as described in the SWQMP.
(Ord. 2004-37)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
(A) (1) The person responsible for any connection in violation of this chapter shall
immediately cause the illegal connection to be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to the
city’s sanitary sewer system upon approval by the Hobart Sanitary District. The person shall
provide the city with written confirmation, satisfactory to the city or its designated representative,
that the connection has been disconnected and, if necessary, redirected to the sanitary sewer.
(2) Any person responsible for illicit discharges or noncompliance with best
management practices at industrial and/or construction sites, and who fails to correct any
prohibited condition or discontinue any prohibited activity at the order of the city shall be liable
to the city for expenses incurred in abating pollution. This may include expenses incurred in
testing, measuring, sampling, collecting, removing, treating and disposing of the polluting
materials and preventing further non-compliance and/or illicit discharges.
(3) The city may institute appropriate actions or proceedings by law or equity for the
enforcement of this chapter. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to issue
restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, and other appropriate forms of remedy or
relief. Each day of non-compliance is considered a separate offense; and nothing herein contained
shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation, including application for injunctive relief. Any of the following enforcement remedies
and penalties, available to be applied independently or concurrently as deemed necessary, shall be
available to the city in response to violations of this chapter. If the person, property or facility has
or is required to have a stormwater discharge permit from the IDEM, the city shall alert the
appropriate state authorities of the violation enforcement remedies:
(a) Notice of violation (NOV). Whenever the city or its designated representative
finds that any person owning or occupying a premises has violated or is violating this chapter or
order issued hereunder, the enforcement official may serve, by personal service, or by registered
or certified mail, upon the person a written NOV. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, or
shorter period as may be prescribed in the NOV, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, which shall include specific required actions, shall
be submitted to the city or its designated representative. Submission of this plan shall in no way
relieve liabilities for violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV.
(b) Revocation of permit. The city or its designated representative may revoke
and require the return of a permit or certificate by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating
the reason for the revocation. Permits or certificates shall be revoked for any substantial departure
from the approved application plans or specifications, refusal or failure to comply with the
requirements of state or local law or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
the permit or certificate. Any permit or certificate mistakenly issued in violation of any applicable
state or local law may also be revoked.
(c) Stop work order. The city or its designated representative, or their designee
may issue a stop work order and require that all activities cease, except those actions that are
necessary to eliminate the illicit discharge. Unacceptable or untimely actions to eliminate the
Stormwater Management
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 43 Title XV
illicit discharge may be used as grounds to revoke permits for the construction site as described
herein.
(d) Compliance order. If any person shall violate the provisions of this chapter,
the city or its designated representative, or his or her designee may give notice to the owner or to
any person in possession of the subject property ordering that all unlawful conditions existing
thereupon be abated within a schedule defined from the date of the notice.
1. The enforcement official shall have the authority to establish and enforce
elements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan and require any business to adopt and
implement such a plan as may be reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. The
enforcement official may establish the requirements of best management practices for any
premises.
2. The notice and order may be given, provided that if in the opinion of the
city or its designated representative, the unlawful condition is such that it is of imminent danger
or peril to the public, then the city or its designated representative may, with or without notice,
proceed to abate the same, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the property. The city
shall be entitled to recover the cost of the actions from the property owner.
(e) Civil penalties. Any person that has been found to have been in violation of
any provision of this chapter, may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed the amount presented
in this division.
1. The penalty may be assessed for each day, beyond schedules applied in
compliance orders or other schedules issued to the property owner or other person responsible,
for unauthorized activity defined in this chapter.
2. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Court shall consider the
following:
a. The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the
public health or to the public or private property resulting from the violation;
b. The duration and gravity of the violation;
c. The effect on ground or surface water quality;
d. The cost of rectifying the damage;
e. The amount of money saved by non-compliance;
f. Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
g. The cumulative effect of other enforcement actions applied for the
same offense;
h. The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply
with the stormwater quality management program; and
i. The costs of enforcement to the city.
Hobart – Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 44 Title XV
3. The maximum civil penalties will be determined by the type of offense.
This indicates the maximum that may be imposed for a first offense and does not reflect the
increases described above for repeat offenses.
a. Illicit discharge: $2,500. Any person who is found to have
improperly disposed of any substance defined as an illicit discharge, not an allowable discharge
or causes the city to be in non-compliance with any applicable environmental permit.
b. Household products: $500. Any person who is found to have
improperly disposed of any substance not included herein that was purchased over-the-counter for
household use, in quantities considered normal for household purposes, which upon discharge to
the stormwater drainage system or drainage network would have an adverse impact on water
quality or cause the city to be in non-compliance with any applicable environmental permit.
4. In the event there are penalties assessed by the state against the city
caused by any person, the person shall be assessed the equivalent amount of civil penalty. This
shall include but is not limited to penalties for improper disposal or illegal dumping, or illicit
connection into the stormwater drainage system.
(f) Administrative fee. Any person who undertakes any development activity
requiring a stormwater management plan hereunder without first submitting the plan for review
and approval shall pay to the city, in addition to any permit or inspection fee, an administrative
fee of up to $2,500.
(g) Order to clean and abate/restore. Any violator may be required to clean
and/or restore land to its condition prior to the violation.
(h) Cost recovery. If corrective action, including maintenance delinquency, is not
taken in the time specified or within a reasonable time, the city may take the corrective action and
the cost of the corrective action shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or the developer. The
cost of the abatement and restoration shall be borne by the owner of the property and the cost
shall be invoiced to the owner of the property. If the invoice is not paid within 90 days, the
enforcement official shall have the authority to place a lien upon and against the property. If the
lien is not satisfied within 90 days, the enforcement official is authorized to take all legal
measures available to enforce the lien as a judgment, including, without limitation, enforcing the
lien in an action brought for a money judgment, by delivery to the assessor or a special
assessment against the property.
(i) Injunctions and/or proceedings at law or in equity. Any violation of this
chapter or of any condition, order, requirement or remedy adopted pursuant hereto may be
restrained, corrected, abated, mandated or enjoined by other appropriate proceeding pursuant to
state law.
(j) Fee or utility credit revocation or adjustment. This enforcement remedy tool
is intended to be available or used if there are, at any time, provisions for a funding mechanism
managed by the city. This enforcement remedy permits that credits (reductions), adjustments
(increases) or other measures to modify fees or utility charges may be revoked or added, in full or
in part, if any provisions of §§ 152.020 et seq. are violated.
Stormwater Management
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 45 Title XV
(k) Civil actions. Any violation of this chapter may be enforced by civil action
brought by the city’s Attorney. Monies recovered under this division shall be paid to the city to be
used exclusively for costs associated with implementing or enforcing the provisions of this
chapter. In any such action, the city may seek, as appropriate, any or all of the following
remedies:
1. A temporary and/or permanent injunction;
2. Assessment of the violator for the costs of any investigation, inspection
or monitoring survey which lead to the establishment of the violation, and for the reasonable costs
of preparing and bringing legal action under this division;
3. Costs incurred in removing, correcting or terminating the adverse effects
resulting from the violation; and
4. Compensatory damages for loss or destruction to water quality, wildlife,
fish and aquatic life.
(l) Emergency orders and abatements. The enforcement official may order the
abatement of any discharge from any source to the stormwater conveyance system when, in the
opinion of the enforcement official, the discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition that
presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the environment or a
violation of a NPDES permit. In emergency situations where the property owner or other
responsible party is unavailable and time constraints are such that service of a notice and order to
abate cannot be effected without presenting an immediate danger to the public health, safety or
welfare of the environment or a violation of a NPDES permit, the city may perform or cause to be
performed such work as shall be necessary to abate the threat or danger. The costs of any such
abatement shall be borne by the owner and shall be collectable in accordance with the provisions
of this division.
(m) Violations deemed a public nuisance. Any condition caused or permitted to
exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety,
welfare and environment and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be abated by injunctive
or other equitable relief as provided by state and local law.
(n) Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive
of any remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and the city may seek
cumulative remedies.
(Ord. 2004-37)
(B) (1) The city may institute appropriate actions or proceedings at law or equity for the
enforcement of §§ 152.040 et seq. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to
issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions and other appropriate forms of
remedy or relief.
(2) Each day of non-compliance is considered a separate offense; and nothing herein
contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation, including application for injunctive relief.
(3) Any of the following enforcement remedies and penalties shall be available to the
city in response to violations of this chapter. The remedies and penalties are available to be

City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 46 Title XV
applied independently or concurrently as deemed necessary by the city. If the person, property or
facility has or is required to have a stormwater discharge permit from the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management (IDEM), the city shall alert the appropriate state authorities of the
violation. Enforcement remedies:
(a) Notice of violation (NOV). If the city or its designated representative finds that
any person owning or occupying a premises has violated or is violating this chapter or order
issued hereunder, the enforcement official may serve, by personal service, or by registered or

shorter period as may be prescribed in the NOV, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the

for violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV.
(b) Revocation of permits. The city, or its designee may revoke and require the
return of a permit or certificate by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason for the
revocation. Permits or certificates shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application plans, or specifications; refusal or failure to comply with the requirements
of state or local law; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit or
certificate. Any permit or certificate mistakenly issued in violation of any applicable state or local
law may also be revoked.
(c) Compliance orders. If any person, company or facility shall violate the
provisions of this chapter, the city, or its designee, may give notice to the owner or to any person
in possession of the subject property, ordering that all unlawful conditions existing thereupon be
abated within a schedule defined from the date of the notice.
1. The enforcement official shall have the authority to establish elements of
a stormwater pollution prevention plan and to require any business to adopt and implement such a
plan, as may be reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. The enforcement
official may establish the requirements of best management practices for any premises.
2. The notice and order may be given provided, that if, in the opinion of the
city or its designated representative, the unlawful condition is such that it is of imminent danger
or peril to the public, then an authorized the city representative may, without notice, proceed to
abate the same, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the property. The city, as described
further in this division, may recover the cost of such actions from the property owner.
(d) Civil penalties. Any person who has been found to have been in violation of
any provision of this chapter, may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed the amount presented

increases described above for repeat offenses.
a. Development without permit: $2,500. To engage in any
development, use, construction, remodeling or other activity of any nature upon land or
improvements thereon subject to the jurisdiction of this chapter without all required permits,
certificates or other forms of authorization as set forth in this chapter.

City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 152 / Page 48 Title XV
(g) Cost recovery. If corrective action, including maintenance delinquency, is not
taken in the time specified, or within a reasonable time, if no time is specified, the city may take
the corrective action, and the cost of the corrective action shall be the responsibility of the owner
and/or the developer. The cost of the abatement and restoration shall be borne by the owner of the
property and the cost shall therefore be invoiced to the owner of the property. If the invoice is not
paid within 90 days, the enforcement official shall have the authority to place a lien upon and
against the property. If the lien is not satisfied within 90 days, the enforcement official is
authorized to take all legal measures as are available to enforce the lien as a judgment, including,
without limitation, enforcing the lien in an action brought for a money judgment, by delivery to
the assessor or a special assessment against the property.
(h) Injunctions and/or proceedings at law or in equity. Any violation of this

state law.
(i) Fee or utility credit revocation. This enforcement tool is intended to be
available or used if there are, at any time, provisions for a funding mechanism managed by the
city. This enforcement remedy permits that credits or other measures to reduce fees or utility

2. Assessment of the violator for the costs of any investigation, inspection
or monitoring survey which lead to the establishment of the violation and for the reasonable costs
of preparing and bringing legal action under this division;
3. Costs incurred in removing, correcting or terminating the adverse effects
resulting from the violation; and
4. Compensatory damages for loss or destruction to water quality, wildlife,
fish and aquatic life.
(k) Emergency orders and abatements. The enforcement official may order the
abatement of any discharge from any source to the stormwater conveyance system when, in the
opinion of the enforcement official, the discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition which
presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or a
violation of an NPDES permit. In emergency situations where the property owner or other
responsible party is unavailable and time constraints are such that service of a notice and order to
abate cannot be effected without presenting an immediate danger to the public health, safety,
welfare, the environment or a violation of a NPDES permit, the city may perform or cause to be
performed the work as shall be necessary to abate the threat or danger. The costs of any such
abatement shall be borne by the owner and shall be collectable in accordance with the provisions
of this division.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Hobart Subdivision Regulations”.
(Prior Code, § 19-1) (Ord. 609, § 1)

Subdivisions
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 153 / Page 3 Title XV
STREET, MAJOR ARTERIAL. A street or highway used primarily for heavy traffic, as
shown on the master plan map.
SUBDIVISION.
(1) The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land into 2 or more lots, sites or other
divisions of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development,
except that the following divisions of land shall not be considered subdivisions within the
meaning of this chapter; provided, however, that, no new streets, roads or easements of access are
involved:
(a) Divisions of land for agricultural purposes where the resulting parcels are 10
acres or larger in size;
(b) Divisions of land upon court order or by testamentary or interstate provisions;
(c) Transfer or exchange of land between adjoining land owners, if the transfer or
exchange does not create additional building lots; and
(d) Replatting of lots within an existing approved and recorded subdivision plat to
either increase the area of the lots by changing lot lines or create not more than 2 building lots;
(2) SUBDIVISION also includes resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context,
relates to the process of subdividing or to the lands or territory divided.
(3) All divisions of land, including the above exceptions, numbered (1) through (5)
inclusive, shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 154 of this code.
(Prior Code, § 19-2) (Ord. 609, § 3; Ord. 780, § 1)
§ 153.003 PLAT FILING; PLAN COMMISSION APPROVAL PREREQUISITE TO
RECORDATION.
No plat or replat of a subdivision of land located within the territorial jurisdiction of the
city’s Plan Commission shall be filed with the Auditor and the Recorder shall not record any such
plat, unless it has first been approved by the city’s Plan Commission and a certification of the
approval entered, in writing, on the face of the plat by the Plan Commission.
(Prior Code, § 19-3) (Ord. 609, § 2)
§ 153.004 INFORMAL CONSULTATION WITH PLAN COMMISSION.
(A) Before preparing the general plan of a subdivision, the subdivider should consult
informally with the Plan Commission in order to become familiar with subdivision requirements,
the relation of his or her property to existing conditions, future plans and community facilities,
utilities and services.
(B) When consulted informally by subdividers, the Plan Commission should discourage the
subdividing of land far in advance of the time that the land is likely to be needed for
development. The Plan Commission should also discourage the subdividing of land that cannot be
Hobart – Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 153 / Page 4 Title XV
efficiently served by public utilities, fire protection or other municipal services, that is subject to
flooding or is topographically unsuitable for development or that for any other reason would be
unwisely or prematurely subdivided. The Plan Commission should encourage the coordinated
platting of adjacent small parcels of land and, to this end, the Commission may make sketch plans
for such coordinated platting or may arrange meetings of the several owners of the small parcels
of land or may carry out the intent of this section by other means as may be lawful and
appropriate.
(Prior Code, § 19-4) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.005 CONSULTATION WITH OTHER PARTIES.
The subdivider should also consult with parties potentially interested in the development,
such as mortgage, insurance and lending institutions, in order to reach, at this initial stage, a clear
understanding of the market demand that should be served, suitability of the location of the
proposed subdivision, the most advantageous general plan or arrangement of streets, lots and
other features of the proposed development.
(Prior Code, § 19-5) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.006 VARIANCES.
(A) Modifications permitted. Where it can be shown in the case of a particular proposed
subdivision that strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary or undue hardship to the subdivider or that these conditions would result in
retarding the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the Plan Commission may vary,
modify or waive such requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured. Any such determination shall be based fundamentally on a finding that unusual
topographical or other exceptional conditions not caused by action of the subdivider require the
variance, modification or waiver and that the granting thereof will not adversely affect the general
public nor have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter or of the master
plan.
(B) Limitations. In no case shall any variance, modification or waiver be more than the least
needed to eliminate the extraordinary or undue hardship or to promote the achievement of the
objectives of these regulations and, in no case, shall the variance, modification or waiver have the
effect of reducing the traffic capacity of any major arterial or collector street and, in no case, shall
it conflict with Chapter 154 of this code.
(C) Conditions. In granting variances, modifications or waivers, the Plan Commission may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards and requirements so affected.
(Prior Code, § 19-6) (Ord. 609, § 8)
§ 153.007 FEES.
(A) Required. In order to cover the costs of examining plans, holding hearings and other
expenses incidental to the approval of a subdivision, the subdivider shall pay a fee at the time of
application for approval of a plat of subdivision. The fee shall be based upon the estimated
number of lots created. At the time the final plat is submitted, the required fee will be recalculated
Subdivisions
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 153 / Page 5 Title XV
on the basis of the actual number of lots created and an adjustment of the fee will be made, the
subdivider to pay an additional amount or to receive a refund if the adjusted fee differs from the
original fee paid. There shall be no refund of any portion of the fee should the subdivider fail to
file a final plat of subdivision. If, because of the failure of the subdivider to file a final plat within
the time permitted, it is necessary to resubmit a preliminary plat for tentative approval, the
subdivider shall be required to pay, without credit for any fees previously paid, the fee currently
in effect at the time of resubmission.
(B) Amounts. The fees for approval of a subdivision shall be computed from the amounts
set out in the Fee Schedule of this code.
(C) Fees in addition to other fees. All fees established by this section are in addition to any
sums paid to cover the costs of review of improvement plans and field inspection of construction
as required under the provisions of § 153.082.
(D) Disposition of fees. All fees collected under the terms of this section shall be credited to
the General Fund of the city.
(Prior Code, § 19-7) (Ord. 609, § 9; Ord. 789, § 1; Ord. 93-51, § 4)
§ 153.008 ENFORCEMENT OF CHAPTER.
(A) The Plan Commission may institute a suit for injunction in the Circuit Court of the
county to restrain a person or a governmental unit from violating the provisions of this chapter.
(B) The Plan Commission may also institute a suit for mandatory injunction directing a
person or a governmental unit to remove a structure erected in violation of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 19-8) (Ord. 609, § 10)
§ 153.009 EFFECT OF CHAPTER.
This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other provision of this
code, city ordinance, regulation or other provision of law, any easement, covenant or other private
agreement or legal relationship; provided that, whenever this chapter imposes restrictions on use
or subdivision of land different from those imposed by any other statute, provision of this code,

impose higher standards shall control; and provided further that, whenever this chapter imposes
greater restrictions on, or higher standards for, the use or subdivision of land than any easement,

APPLICATION PROCEDURE
§ 153.030 CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL; REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall submit to the Secretary of the Plan Commission a written application
for a certificate of approval of a subdivision plat at least 10 days prior to the meeting of the Plan
Commission at which it is to be considered.
(Prior Code, § 19-12) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.031 TENTATIVE PLAN APPROVAL.
(A) Approval of a tentative plan by the Plan Commission shall be required in all cases in
which a written application for a certificate of approval of a subdivision plat is filed. Approval of
a tentative plan by the Plan Commission shall be required prior to approval of a preliminary plat.
In order to be considered for tentative plan approval, a petitioner must satisfy the requirements of
§ 153.096. Approval of a tentative plan by the Plan Commission is not an acceptance of the
subdivision plat or planned unit development for record and the acceptance shall not be indicated
on the face of the tentative plan. The approval shall be deemed only tentative approval of the
subdivider’s application and shall constitute only an approval of the general plan as a guide in the
preparation of the preliminary plat and final plat for approval and recording upon fulfillment of
all requirements of this chapter. The tentative plan approval shall not prohibit the Plan
Commission from introducing revisions which may be subsequently deemed necessary in the
interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(B) A public hearing shall not be required for tentative plan approval.
(Ord. 99-39, § 1)
§ 153.032 PRELIMINARY PLAT; FILING; FEES.
Three prints of the preliminary plat of subdivision shall be filed with the Plan Commission at
the time application is submitted. The preliminary plat shall comply with the provisions of §
153.095. Fees charged for the filing of a subdivision plat shall be paid in full on the basis of the
estimated number of lots created and as specifically provided in § 153.007 at the time the
application is submitted.

§ 153.033 PRELIMINARY PLAT; PLAN COMMISSION ACTION.
(A) The Plan Commission shall take any 1 or all of the following actions:
(1) Approve the preliminary plat;
(2) Approve conditionally the preliminary plat, thereby requiring additions,
corrections, changes or other information necessary for compliance with this code for approval of
the preliminary plat; or
(3) Disapprove the subdivision proposal preliminary plat in accordance with its
determination whether or not all requirements of this chapter are satisfied and when it finds that
the proposal does not comply with the requirements of this chapter or other ordinances of Hobart,
or where a proposed subdivision would adversely affect the health, safety or general welfare of
the city.
(B) The action shall be taken within 73 days after the subdivider’s application, the
preliminary plat and all other required materials are submitted to the Secretary of the
Commission; provided that, the Plan Commission may delay its action at the request of the
applicant.
(C) Whichever of the actions listed above the Commission takes, the findings and the
reasons therefore must be set forth in writing and show consideration of the following subdivision
requirements:
(1) Design standards including, but not limited to:
(a) Suitability of land;
(b) Streets, sidewalks, public ways;
(c) Easements;
(d) Lots;
(e) Open spaces; and
(f) Public sites.

§ 153.034 PRELIMINARY PLAT; MODIFICATION.
If the preliminary plat is approved with modification or waiver of certain requirements, the
Plan Commission shall set forth, in its own records, such modifications or waivers and the
reasons therefor.
(Prior Code, § 19-15) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.035 PRELIMINARY PLAT; CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
If the preliminary plat is approved conditionally, the Plan Commission shall set forth, in its
own records, the conditions and reasons therefor, and provide the subdivider with a copy. In any
additional approval, the Plan Commission may require the subdivider to submit a revised
preliminary plat.
(Prior Code, § 19-16) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.036 PRELIMINARY PLAT; DISAPPROVAL.
If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the Plan Commission shall set forth the reasons for the
action in its own records and provide the subdivider with a copy. The Plan Commission should, if
possible, make recommendations on the basis of which the proposed subdivision may be
approved.
(Prior Code, § 19-17) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.037 PRELIMINARY PLAT; EFFECT OF APPROVAL.
(A) If the preliminary plat is approved, the Plan Commission shall enter the action on its
official records and notify the applicant of the approval.
(B) Approval of a preliminary plat by the Plan Commission is not an acceptance of the
subdivision plat for record and shall not be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat. The
approval shall be deemed only tentative approval of the subdivider’s application and shall
constitute only an expression of approval of a general plan as a guide in the preparation of a final
plat for final approval and recording, upon fulfillment of all requirements of this chapter. The
tentative approval shall not limit the Plan Commission in introducing changes or revisions which
it may subsequently deem necessary to the interests and needs of the community.
(Prior Code, § 19-18) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.038 PRELIMINARY PLAT; WAIVER FOR CERTAIN LOTS.
Following informal consultation between the Plan Commission and a subdivider as provided
for in § 153.004, if the Plan Commission determines that a proposed subdivision would:
(A) Create only 2 or 3 lots; and/or
(B) Would not include the creation of any part of 1 or more streets, public easements or
other right-of-way, whether public or private, for access to or from such lots, the Plan
Commission may permit an application for approval of a plat or subdivision to be accompanied
Subdivisions
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 153 / Page 9 Title XV
by the final plat, thus waiving the requirement that a preliminary plat be filed. In addition to
complying with all requirements of § 153.097, the final plat in such cases shall also be
accompanied by the materials specified in § 153.095. No other procedural requirement of this
chapter, including tentative approval may be waived, nor may any substantive requirement be
waived pursuant to this section, the purpose of which is limited to a simplification of procedural
requirements in a limited class of cases in which submission of a preliminary plat seems likely to
be unnecessary.
(Prior Code, § 19-19) (Ord. 609, § 8)
§ 153.039 PRELIMINARY PLAT; EXPIRATION; EXTENSIONS.
Tentative approval of a subdivision preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum period
of 12 months, unless, upon application by the developer, the Plan Commission grants an
extension. If the final plat has not been submitted for final approval within this time limit, a
preliminary plat shall again be submitted to the Plan Commission for tentative approval.
(Prior Code, § 19-20) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.040 PUBLIC HEARING.
If the Plan Commission tentatively approves the subdivider’s application, it shall set a date
for a hearing, notify the subdivider in writing and notify, by proper publication or otherwise, at
least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, any person or governmental unit having a
probable interest in the proposed plat. The cost of publication of the notice shall be paid by the
subdivider to the publisher at the time such notice is inserted. In addition to the legal description,
in advertising, the area shall be identified as to its location in terms familiar to the general public.
(Prior Code, § 19-21) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.041 FINAL PLAT; SUBMISSION TO PLAN COMMISSION; ADJUSTMENT OF
FILING FEES.
The subdivider shall submit to the Plan Commission 1 original tracing and 3 prints of the
final plat of the subdivision. The final plat shall comply with the provisions of § 153.097 and
shall be accompanied by such other documents and materials as may be required by this chapter.
At the time the final plat is submitted, an adjusted filing fee will be determined on the basis of the
actual number of lots created by the subdivision, and any additional fee shall be paid or refunds
made at that time.
(Prior Code, § 19-22) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.042 FINAL PLAT; ACTION BY PLAN COMMISSION.
(A) After public hearing and submission of the final plat, the Plan Commission shall
approve or disapprove the subdivider’s application for approval of a subdivision plat. If the Plan
Commission approves, it shall cause to be transcribed upon the original tracing of the final plat its
certificate of approval and shall affix the Commission’s seal upon the original tracing, together
with the signatures of the Secretary and Chairperson of the Plan Commission. If the Commission
disapproves, it shall set forth the reasons for the disapproval in its own records and provide the

(B) The Plan Commission shall take final action, on all applications that are tentatively
approved, within 73 days after the meeting at which tentative approval is given, or within 46 days
after the final plat is submitted, whichever is later. Failure by the Plan Commission to act within
the period shall be deemed approval of the subdivision and the Secretary of the Plan Commission
shall issue a certificate to that effect upon demand; provided, however, that, the Commission may
delay any preliminary or final action at the request of the developer, in which case the provisions
of this section shall not apply.
(Prior Code, § 19-23) (Ord. 609, § 4; Ord. 951, § 1)
§ 153.043 FINAL PLAT; TIME LIMIT FOR RECORDING.
Final approval of the final plat by the Plan Commission shall become null and void unless
the plat is recorded within 60 days after the date of final approval; provided that, the Plan
Commission may extend this time limit at the request of the subdivider.
(Prior Code, § 19-24) (Ord. 609, § 4)
§ 153.044 FINAL APPROVAL NOT TO CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS.
Final approval of a subdivision plat by the Plan Commission shall in no way constitute legal
acceptance of any dedicated streets, alleys or other public lands.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 153.060 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
(A) Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Plan Commission to be unsuitable for
platting because of topography, drainage or for other reasons, shall not be platted for residential
or commercial occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase or cause danger to health, life,
property or aggravate any flood hazard.
(B) Land deemed unsuitable for platting shall include, without being limited to:
(1) Land with an elevation less than 4 feet above the highest groundwater level;
provided that, land with an elevation of between 2 and 4 feet above the highest ground water level

§ 153.061 STREETS.
(A) Generally. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the master plan and shall be considered in relation to existing and planned
streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain features such as streams, swamps and
existing tree growth and to the proposed uses of the lands to be served by the streets.
(B) Arrangement. Where it is not shown on the master plan, the arrangement of streets in a
subdivision shall either:
(1) Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets
in surrounding areas; or
(2) Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Plan
Commission to meet a particular situation in which topographical or other conditions make
continuation of or conformance to existing streets impractical.
(C) Local streets. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by heavy and through
traffic is discouraged.
(D) Major arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major arterial street, the Plan Commission, at its discretion, may require that certain marginal
access streets be included along the margin of the property, may reverse the frontage of lots by
adding screen planting in a no-access reservation along rear property lines which then border the
major street and may require deep lots with rear service alleys or may require such other
treatment as it deems advisable to give adequate protection to residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
(E) Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets are prohibited, except where
their control is definitely placed with the city under conditions approved by the Plan Commission.
(F) Street jogs. Street jogs shall be avoided.
(G) Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on major arterial and collector streets.
(H) Sight distance. A minimum vertical sight distance with clear visibility measured along
the center line shall be provided of at least 600 feet on major arterial streets, 300 feet on collector
streets and 200 feet on local streets.
(I) Minimum radii. The minimum radii of curvature on the centerline shall not be less than
500 feet on major arterial streets, 200 feet on collector streets and 100 feet on local streets.
(J) Intersections. Intersecting streets shall be laid out at as nearly right angles as possible
and no such angle of intersection shall be less than 60 degrees. Property lines at street
intersections shall be rounded with a radius of at least 20 feet, measured at curblines; provided
that, where the angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees, such greater radius shall be
required as the Plan Commission may deem necessary. The Commission may permit chords or
cutoffs in place of rounded corners. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb
having the required radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street intersection to less than
Hobart – Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 153 / Page 12 Title XV
normal width, the property line at the street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back to
permit the construction.
(K) Right-of-way and roadway widths. Unless otherwise shown on the master plan, right-ofway
and roadway widths shall not be less than the following:

sides: 60 feet of right-of-way, 33 feet of roadway; and
(b) Not providing through access (cul-de-sacs) or developed on 1 side only: 60
feet of right-of-way, 31 feet of roadway.
(L) Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this chapter and
where the Plan Commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half
when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there exists a half street adjacent to a tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted within the tract.
(M) Dead-end streets. If a street is designed to have 1 end permanently closed, the closed
end shall not be more than 500 feet from an intersection of the street with another street. At the
closed end of the street, there shall be provided a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter
of at least 60 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. Where the Plan
Commission deems it desirable to provide street access to adjoining property, proposed streets
shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of the property. The deadend streets shall be
provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 60 feet.
(N) Street names. No street names shall be used that will duplicate or that may, in the
judgment of the Plan Commission, be confused with the names of existing streets. Streets that are
now or will eventually be continuations of existing streets shall be called by the names of the
existing streets.
(O) Grades. No street grade shall be less than 0.5%. No major arterial or collector street
shall have a grade in excess of 5% and no local street shall have a grade in excess of 10%.

§ 153.082 APPROVAL OF IMPROVEMENT PLANS.
(A) Planning engineer. After receipt of an application for approval of a plat of subdivision,
the Plan Commission shall designate the city’s Engineer to be the planning engineer who shall
perform the duties specified by this chapter in connection with the approval of the application by
the Commission. No individual shall serve as a planning engineer if the individual has, at any
time, rendered any professional services to the applicant in connection with the subdivision under
review.
(B) Approval of improvement plans by Commission. No improvements or installations shall
be made unless and until all necessary plans, profiles and specifications have been submitted to
and approved by the Plan Commission, after recommendation of the planning engineer
designated as provided in this section. After such plans, profiles and specifications are submitted
for review, the planning engineer shall prepare an estimate of cost for office checking and field
inspection and the subdivider shall, thereupon, deposit with the Secretary of the Commission an
amount of money equal to the estimated cost. All work done by the planning engineer in
connection with checking, computing and correcting such plans for improvements and
installations and in connection with field inspection of the construction thereof, shall be charged
to the deposit. If, during the progress of work, it shall appear that the cost thereof will exceed the
amount so deposited, the planning engineer shall notify the Plan Commission and the subdivider
of this fact and shall do no further work in connection with the review of field inspection until the
subdivider has deposited with the Commission the additional amount of money necessary to
cover the cost of the work. Upon completion of the work of checking plans and inspecting the
construction of improvements and installations, the planning engineer shall forward to the Plan
Commission a statement of the amount of his or her fees to be charged against the deposits made
by the subdivider. The Commission shall thereupon refund to the subdivider any unexpended
balance of such deposits. If such fees for any reason exceed the amount of the deposit, the
Commission shall collect the balance due and shall issue a statement that the charges have been
paid.
(Prior Code, § 19-35) (Ord. 609, § 6)
§ 153.083 STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND INSTALLATIONS.

Plan Commission, the subdivider shall connect with the storm drainage system, if the connection
is deemed necessary by the Plan Commission and shall do the grading and provide the drainage
structures as may be required by the city or county agencies involved.
(3) Where a public stormwater system is not reasonably accessible as determined by
the Plan Commission, but where the plans for the stormwater drainage system of the district in
which the subdivision is located have been prepared and officially approved, the subdivider shall
install drainage facilities as may be deemed necessary by the Plan Commission in conformity
with the official plans.
(4) If the subdivision is in an area where no public stormwater system is available, the
subdivider shall provide a private storm sewer system for draining the subdivision area, with
particular attention being given to proper drainage of the streets. It is the specific intent of this
chapter that for the good of the city streets and the land of the citizens adjoining, that no
subdivision be approved without proper stormwater systems and place of disposal for the
stormwater where other properties will not be adversely affected.
(5) Whenever the construction of streets and necessary stormwater system in a
subdivision is such that direction of stormwater flow is diverted to affect surrounding properties,
the developer shall obtain sufficient drainage easements to provide adequate disposal of the
stormwater.
(C) Sanitary sewers. If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the extension of an
existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Plan Commission, the subdivider or
developer shall provide a system of sanitary sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for
each lot and shall connect same to existing city sewers at his or her expense. Where a public
sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the subdivider, the owner or the developer may

Plan Commission. Requirements shall be in line with those as specified in U.S. Public Health
Service Publication No. 397, Studies on Household Disposal System, or as specified by the state’s
Board of Health.
(E) Septic tanks and disposal fields.
(1) Septic tanks and disposal fields shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements of the laws of the state.
(2) In all cases where it has been determined by the Plan Commission that septic tank
disposal systems are not feasible, a group sewage disposal system may be required.
(F) Public water supply.
(1) Where public water supply is within reasonable distance, as determined by the
Plan Commission, the subdivider or developer shall construct a system of water mains and
connect with the public water supply and provide a connection for each lot.
(2) Where public water supply is not available, each main structure shall be provided
with an individual well by the developer or owner.
(G) Test wells.
(1) At least 1 test well shall be made in the area being platted for each 100 lots or for
each 25 acres of area, whichever is the smaller. In cases where copies of the logs of existing wells
located within the area being platted are available, this may be submitted in lieu of making test
wells.
(2) Test wells shall be at least 25 feet in depth, and shall produce safe potable drinking
water at a rate of not less than 5 gallons per minute.

disposal facilities; 10 feet from all cast-iron sewer lines; 30 feet from any vitrified tile sewer
lines; and, shall not be located within any floodplain.
(2) As a precaution against seepage, a watertight seal shall be provided around the
pump mounting.
(3) All abandoned wells shall be sealed in a manner that will render them watertight.
(4) In all cases where it has been determined that individual water supplies from
private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system will be required.
(I) Public water distribution system. Public wells and other public water distribution
systems shall meet the requirements of the state’s Board of Health.
(J) Monuments.
(1) A complete survey shall be made by a surveyor or a registered civil engineer.

§ 154.125 LOT STANDARDS.
Lot and Site Development Standards for each district dictate the minimum and/or maximum
standards that apply to lots and sites within an Office Service District (OS-2)
(A) Lot Area: 1 acre minimum
(B) Lot Width: One hundred feet (100’) minimum lot width is the allowable horizontal
distance between the side property lines of a lot measured at eight angles to its depth along a
straight line parallel to the front lot line at the front setback line.
(C) Lot Frontage: Fifty feet (50’) on a public street. The minimum length of a lot frontage
shall be measured between side lot lines at the street right-of-way or private street easement.
(D) Lot Coverage: Fifty-five percent (55%) maximum lot coverage for all primary and
accessory structures, drives and parking.
(Ord. 2016-39)
§ 154.126 MINIMUM YARD SETBACKS.
Yard setback requirements in an OS-2 are as follows:
(A) Front Yard Setback: Minimum of thirty feet (30’) from a local street/cul-de-sac, thirtyfive
feet (35’) from a collector street and forty feet (40’) from a major arterial. The horizontal
space between the front lot line and the front setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot,
generally parallel with and measured from the front lot line, defining the area in which no
building or structure may be located above ground, except as provided herein.
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 54 Title XV
Required front yards may include pedestrian walks, drives, entrance guard boxes, flag poles,
fences, screening walls and similar appurtenant structures. Required side and rear yards may
include pedestrian walks, driveways, interior access driveways, interior access drives, off-street
parking areas, entrance guard boxes, flag poles, fences, screening walls and similar appurtenant
structures.
(B) Side Yard Setback: Minimum forty feet (40’). The horizontal space between the side
lot lines and the side setback lines, extending to the front and rear lot lines, generally parallel with
and measured from each side lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be
located above ground, except as provided herein. For corner and through lots, any side of a
structure that faces a street shall meet front setback requirements.
(C) Rear Yard Setback: Minimum forty feet (40’). The horizontal space between the rear
lot line and the rear setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot, generally parallel with and
measured from the rear lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located

shall meet front setback requirements.
(D) Naturally Sensitive Areas Setback: Minimum forty foot (40’) setback distance shall
exist when structural development occurs on a lot that is adjacent to naturally sensitive areas
including but not limited to riparian areas and wetlands. The City Planner, or his/her designee,
may determine if a feature constitutes a naturally sensitive area. This setback shall overlap front,
side, and rear setbacks. The setback with the largest width shall apply.
(E) Bufferyard/Screening Setback: The intent of the buffering and screening standards is to
lessen the potential conflicts between the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in
adjacent districts. Screening minimizes the friction between incompatible land uses and improves
the aesthetic and functional quality of new development through the use of setbacks and
landscaping. The potential degree of conflict between the uses determines the extent of the buffer
required.
(1) The bufferyard standards only apply along the property lines where two dissimilar
uses or zoning classifications meet. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the
presence of streets, alleys, and other features. Existing mature vegetation (such as streams and
fence rows) may be cited towards required buffering.
(2) Trees, shrubs and emergent vegetation specifically selected for wetland or pond
perimeters should be specified to enhance if not effectively screen detention areas.
(3) All required bufferyards shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall
be in addition to applicable setbacks required in HMC § 154.126(E)(5)(a) (b) (c).
(4) All landscape material must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly
appearance, free from all debris and refuse. Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread
and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures may
only be used to ensure the public safety and/or health of the vegetation.
(5) Screening may include landscaping, walls, fences, hedges, berms, and existing
vegetation. The buffer width, height, and appropriate screening for similar and dissimilar uses
and shall be in accordance with the applicable bufferyard regulations and as shown below in
(5)(a), Bufferyard Type Requirement Chart; (5)(b Bufferyard Type Illustration; (5)(c) Bufferyard

§ 154.200 BUFFERYARDS / SCREENING.
The intent of the buffering and screening standard is to lessen the potential conflicts between
the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in adjacent districts. Screening minimizes
the friction between incompatible land uses and improves the aesthetic and functional quality of
new development through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of conflict
between the uses determines the extent of the buffer required.

§ 154.233 BUFFERYARDS / SCREENING.
The intent of the buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts
between the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in adjacent districts. Screening
minimizes the friction between incompatible land uses and improves the aesthetic and functional
quality of new development through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of
conflict between the uses determines the extent of the buffer required.
(A) The bufferyard standards only apply along the property lines where two dissimilar uses
or zoning classifications meet. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the presence of
streets, alleys, and other features. Existing mature vegetation (such as streams and fence rows)
may be cited towards required buffering.
(B) Trees, shrubs and emergent vegetation specifically selected for wetland or pond
perimeters should be specified to enhance if not effectively screen detention areas.
(C) All required bufferyards shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall be
in addition applicable to setbacks required in HMC §§154.224, 154.225, 154.226 and 154.227.
(D) All landscape material must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly
appearance, free from all debris and refuse. Landscape material are intended to grow, spread and
mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures may only
be used to ensure the public safety and/or health of the vegetation.
(E) Screening may include landscaping, walls, fences, hedges, berms, and existing
vegetation. The buffer width, height, and appropriate screening for similar and dissimilar uses
and shall be in accordance with the applicable bufferyard regulations and as shown below in

F-1 FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICTS – HAZARD AREAS
§ 154.270 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND
OBJECTIVES.
(A) Statutory Authorization. The Indiana Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4 granted the power
to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common
Council of the City of Hobart does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
(B) Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of City of Hobart are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately
elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(C) Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and,
(6) Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 124 Title XV
of Hobart by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(D) Objectives. The objectives of this subchapter are:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

§ 154.271 DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this subchapter shall be
interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
subchapter its most reasonable application.
A ZONE means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff
from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or
rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as
Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below:
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths
are shown.
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones.
(Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood
depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 125 Title XV
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood
protection.
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event,
but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood
protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made
on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or
depths are shown.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400
square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should
constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to
have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages,
carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
ADDITION (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other
than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated
by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
APPEAL means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any
provision of this subchapter.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING means a designated AO or AH Zone on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow.
BASE FLOOD means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual chance
flood.
BASEMENT means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground
level) on all sides.

too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals,
police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

improvements, etc.;
(5) mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations;
(6) construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
(7) storage of materials; or
(8) any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or
surface waters.
“Development” does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and
facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of
permanent structures.
ELEVATED STRUCTURE means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem
wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).

completed before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION
means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FIVE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (500-YEAR FLOOD) means the flood that has a 0.2
percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year.
FLOOD means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of
surface waters from any source.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM) means an official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM) means an official map of a community,
issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been identified
as Zone A.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.

feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see “Freeboard”)
FLOODPLAIN means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The
floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT means the operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where
possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness
plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS means this subchapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone
areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage
prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING) is a method of protecting a structure that
ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to
the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact
forces.
FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE is a form used to certify compliance for nonresidential
structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This
certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect.
FLOODWAY is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains
adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak
flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream.
FREEBOARD means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is
applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base
flood.
FRINGE is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this subchapter) means the exceptional hardship that
would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Hobart Board of Zoning
Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved.
Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more
expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use
than originally intended.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 129 Title XV
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface,
prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURES means any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a
substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention
ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any
combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates
on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.
LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during
the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map
and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The
community must adopt or amend its floodplain management regulations during this six-month
period unless the community has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types
of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are presented below:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means an amendment to the currently effective
FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of
property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective
FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to
an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE means the lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately
next to the structure.
LOWEST FLOOR means the lowest elevation described among the following:
(1) the top of the lowest level of the structure;
(2) the top of the basement floor;
(3) the top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure;
(4) the top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars; or
(5) the top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an
elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood

City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 130 Title XV
waters unless:
(a) the walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces
on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two
openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a
structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls; and,
(b) the total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for every
one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever
is higher; and
(c) such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and
building access.
MANUFACTURED HOMES means a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent

include a "recreational vehicle."
MARKET VALUE means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a
willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market
value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age
of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
MITIGATION means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people
and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect
people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) is the federal program that makes
flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through
the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry.
NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
NEW CONSTRUCTION means any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
on or after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
NON-BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY means the floodway of any river or stream other
than a boundary river.
NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a

OBSTRUCTION includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee,
dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire,
fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried
by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD is the flood that has a one percent (1%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the
letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory Flood”.
PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR) is an official republication of a community’s FEMA
map to effect changes to base (1-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary
delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a
result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas,
or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE, anything which is injurious to the safety or health of
an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay,
stream, canal, or basin.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2) 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as
a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULAR PROGRAM means the phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP
where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher
amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.
REGULATORY FLOOD means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable
to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in §154.272(B)
of this subchapter. The "Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “One-
Percent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
REPETITIVE LOSS means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood
event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SECTION 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended,
which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the
Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or
other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances
that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone
areas.
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 132 Title XV
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of
the City subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Hobart are
generally identified as such on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas
are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
START OF CONSTRUCTION includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement
of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a
prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for
more than 180 days.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes
structures that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage" regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements.
SUSPENSION means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the
community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations
required for participation in the NFIP.
VARIANCE is a grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter, which permits
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this subchapter where specific enforcement
would result in unnecessary hardship.
VIOLATION means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with this subchapter. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification,
or other evidence of compliance required in this subchapter is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATERCOURSE means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 133 Title XV
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically
designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
X ZONE means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X
zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by
the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded
X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of
flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
ZONE means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of
flooding in the area.
ZONE A (see definition for A ZONE)
ZONE B, C, AND X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or
minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones
could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems.
Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
(Prior Code, § 24-140) (Ord. 95-20; Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41; Ord. 2010-16, § 1; Ord. 2011-07,
§ 1; Ord. 2011-35, § 1; Ord. 2012-02, § 2; Ord. 2016-07)
§ 154.272 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(A) Lands to Which This Subchapter Applies. This subchapter shall apply to all SFHAs and
known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Hobart.
(B) Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data. This subchapter’s protection standard is
the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below.
(1) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs
within the jurisdiction of the City of Hobart shall be as delineated on the one-percent annual
chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas dated January 18, 2012 and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18,
2012 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
(2) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs
within the jurisdiction of the City of Hobart, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Lake County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012 as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject
site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the
party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To
be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for
review and subsequently approved.
(3) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 134 Title XV
map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the
community’s known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
(4) Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more restrictive data
in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction
(development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data
provided by FEMA.
(C) Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit. A Floodplain Development Permit
shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this subchapter prior to the
commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(D) Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this subchapter and other
applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full
compliance with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable regulations.
(E) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This subchapter is not intended to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
subchapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
(F) Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations.
(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
(2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site
shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood
elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and
the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for
a LOMA.
(G) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this subchapter all provisions
shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(H) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this
subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on
rare occasions. Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability on the part of the City of
Hobart, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 135 Title XV
damage that results from reliance on this subchapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
(I) Penalties for Violation. Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the
SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or
conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this subchapter. All violations shall
be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the
Zoning Code for the City of Hobart. All violations shall be subject to §10.99.
(1) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to
exist.
(2) The City of Hobart Plan Commission shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage
by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
(3) Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Hobart from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the
person or persons responsible.
(J) Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC). In order for buildings to qualify for a claim
payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure”, the National Reform Act of 1994
requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related
damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the
second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or
exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.

deed a non-conversion agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor (where the
interior height of the enclosure exceeds 6 feet) shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted; the community will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion
agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Lake County Recorder and shall be presented as a
condition of issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.
(5) Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be
constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the following:
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 142 Title XV

outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred
“substantial damage” as a result of a flood:
1. The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such
that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement;
2. Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below
the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as
required for elevated structures in §154.274(B)(4);
3. Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation
of a manufactured home are not required to have openings;
(b) These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in

Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 143 Title XV
2. Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below
the FPG (crawlspaces or under floor spaces) shall be designed to preclude finished living space
and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in §154.274(B)(4);
3. Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation
of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
(c) Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
1. be on site for less than 180 days;
2. be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels
or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or
3. meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in this
§154.274(B)(6).
(7) Accessory Structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing standards may
be granted for accessory structures. Such structures must meet the following standards:
(a) Shall not be used for human habitation;
(b) Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
(c) Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum resistance to
the flow of floodwaters;
(d) Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
(e) Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be elevated or
floodproofed to or above the FPG;
(f) Shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated
structures in §154.274(B)(4).
(8) Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or liquid
storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement.
(C) Standards for Subdivision Proposals.

damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards;
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 144 Title XV
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater
than the lesser of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres;
(5) All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit
density of development permitted in the SFHA;
(6) All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians
and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
(D) Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible,
located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible
within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within
the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all
critical facilities to the extent possible.
(E) Standards for Identified Floodways. Located within SFHAs, established in
§154.272(B), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.
Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for
any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This
includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc., undertaken
before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (I.C.
14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a nonboundary
river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition
above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or letter of
authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway
or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the
provisions contained in §154.274 of this subchapter have been met. The Floodplain Development
Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations
(if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or
future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of
the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood
of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 145 Title XV
elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as
proven with hydraulic analyses.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City shall
submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the
regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR §65.12.
(F) Standards for Identified Fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in §154.274 of this subchapter have been met. The key provision is that the
top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the
FPG.
(G) Standards for SFHAs without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or
Floodways/Fringes.
(1) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: If the site is in
an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined,
and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans
and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for
construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided
the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in
§154.274 of this subchapter have been met.
(2) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile: If the site is in an
identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined
and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in §154.274 of this subchapter have been
met.
(3) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14
of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
(H) Standards for Flood Prone Areas. All development in known flood prone areas not
identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable
standards as required per §154.274.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS DISTRICTS
§ 154.295 PURPOSE.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 149 Title XV
(A) The purpose of this subchapter is to provide greater design flexibility in the
development of land when consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and intent of the zoning
ordinance. The use of planned unit developments shall be encouraged to promote smart growth
ideologies of a harmonious variety of uses, and/or are compatible with surround areas and/or
foster the creation of attractive, healthful, efficient and stable environments for living, shopping
or working.
(B) The planned unit development district regulations and procedures may apply to the
redevelopment of presently developed lands, or the development of open or vacant lands, and
may apply to parcels of relatively small size as well as large-scale developments and their
relationship with other surrounding uses and the overall characteristics of the area in which it is to
be located.
(C) Planned unit development district regulations are intended to encourage innovations in
land development techniques so that the growing demands of the community may be met with
greater flexibility and type, design and layout of sites and buildings and by the conservation and
more efficient use of open spaces and other amenities generally enhancing the quality of life.
(D) Planned unit development district projects should also encourage a more efficient use of
land which reflects the changes in technology of land development so that the resulting
economies may accrue to the benefit of the community at large.
(E) To that end, the effect of the regulations and development guidelines contained in this
chapter as to use, bulk, yards, height and the design guidelines contained in § 154.308, may be
waived or modified to provide relief there from to allow unconventional development in the
specific planned unit development project. The community may then benefit from such desirable
but unconventional developments and be protected and insured through the limitations and
conditions placed upon and made part of the ordinance granting the specific “planned unit
development district”.

(F) Off-Street Parking and Loading.
(1) Parking: The HMC §§154.355 - 154.361, as amended, sets forth minimum
requirements for parking lot design and buffering. Parking areas shall be planned to transition
from the streetscape to the structure and to provide for adequate planting and safe pedestrian
movement. The following standards/guidelines supplement those requirements.
(a) Minimum Parking Requirements:
1. One (1) space per one thousand square feet (1,000) of gross floor area or
one (1) space for each two employees on the premises during the largest shift, whichever is
greater.
2. Parking areas, wherever possible, shall be located to the side and rear of
structures and away from streets and highways, thereby using buildings or other architectural
elements as a visual barrier.
3. Parking spaces shall not directly abut structures. Provide adequate space
fifteen feet (15’) minimum for walkways and landscaping between parking and structures.
4. Landscape plantings and trees shall be required on the perimeter and
within parking lots to reduce the visual impact of large open areas of pavement and to reduce the
buildup of heat on dark colored paving (heat island effect). Refer to HMC §§154.308(G) and (H)
of these guidelines for planting requirements. The landscape plantings will also reduce
stormwater runoff.
(2) Loading Berths. HMC §§154.360 and 154.361 sets forth minimum requirements
for loading berths. The following standards/guidelines supplement those requirements:

blend it into the landscape using building offsets, screen walls, berms and other design
techniques.
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 166 Title XV
(c) All loading areas and delivery doors shall be screened so as not to be visible
from, or cast light into any adjacent residential area while vehicles are parked or moving.
Landscaping can be used to supplement the screening.
(G) Bufferyards and Screening.
The intent of the buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts
between the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in adjacent districts. Screening
minimizes the friction between incompatible land uses and improves the aesthetic and functional
quality of new development through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of
conflict between the uses determines the extent of the buffer required.
(1) The bufferyard standards only apply along the property lines where two dissimilar
uses or zoning classifications meet. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the
presence of streets, alleys, and other features. Existing mature vegetation (such as streams and
fence rows) may be cited towards required buffering.
(2) Trees, shrubs and emergent vegetation specifically selected for wetland or pond
perimeters should be specified to enhance if not effectively screen detention areas.
(3) All required bufferyards shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall
be in addition to applicable setbacks required in HMC §154.195(B).
(4) All landscape material must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly
appearance, free from all debris and refuse. Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread
and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures may
only be used to ensure the public safety and/or health of the vegetation.
(5) Screening may include landscaping, walls, fences, hedges, berms, and existing
vegetation. The buffer width, height, and appropriate screening for similar and dissimilar uses
and shall be in accordance with the applicable bufferyard regulations and as shown below in
(G)(5)(a), Bufferyard Type Requirement Chart; (G)(5)(b) Bufferyard Type Illustration; and
(G)(5)(c) Bufferyard Type Setback Regulation Table:

(D) Urban design principles.
(1) The proposed development must be compatible as to form with neighboring
developments.
(2) Each development must become a part of a larger neighborhood and, therefore,
cannot be an island unto itself.
(3) Each site to be developed must be well defined and shall be large enough to avoid
a piecemeal approach.
(4) The development must be adequately screened and buffered to minimize the ill
effects of both the development on the surrounds and vice versa, and to provide identity and
definition to the development.
(5) Open space, trees and shrubs, fences, earth berms or compatible transitional land
uses may all serve as buffers.
(6) Adequate landscaping shall be placed around the perimeter of the site, near the
building and internal to the parking lot to minimize the ill effect of excessive paved areas.
(7) Features which possess uniqueness on a site shall be preserved.
(8) Structures shall not be located in the floodway.
(9) Changes to the natural terrain shall be minimized, including stands of mature trees.
(10) Open space proposed by a developer must be accessible, and where possible linked
to an overall city-wide system.
(11) The development must result in a separation of residential areas from major noiseproducing
sources.
(12) Development shall be restricted on lands with steep slopes, wetlands, unstable soil,
filled areas or areas of unique vegetation.
(E) Public safety/services.
(1) The proposed development shall not pose an undo burden on police or fire
services.
(2) If the development results in a significant increase for park, school or other public
services, property dedicated for these purposes shall be required as a condition of development.
(3) Appropriate right-of-way and easement dedications shall occur in order to provide
necessary access for proper utility maintenance.

more than 6 inches of soil may be placed over tree roots within the protected area, nor shall soil
be graded away.
(f) Variances.
1. Any variance from the requirements of this section may be requested
from the Plan Commission for sites employing innovative landscaping treatments.
2. The innovations are encouraged and shall be favorably considered and
recommended by the Site Review Committee as a positive attribute in connection with such a
request.
(G) Drainage impact.
(1) The goals of reviewing drainage should be to:
(a) Minimize the impact of drainage and runoff on neighboring properties;
(b) Reduce and delay the impact of rain or thawing events on ditches, creeks,
rivers and storm water management structures;
(c)Work towards the goal that rain and thawing snow should remain on the
property as long as possible to slow it downstream impact and maximize the amount that is
absorbed into the soil on site; and
(d) When possible, work to correct existing drainage problems created by
previous development activities.
(2) All site plans shall include a Drainage Plan that is prepared by a licensed
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor. The Drainage Plan shall include:
(a) Current property elevations;
(b) Proposed finished property elevations. In the case of developments with
multiple properties that will be developed at a future time, the proposed property elevations
shown in the Drainage Plan should be the elevations after the individual properties are developed
in the future. In cases where the subdivision or installation of infrastructure in a development of
lots that will be developed in the future, will change the topography of the property, the Drainage
Plan should also include the planned elevations that will exist after subdivision and installation of
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 226 Title XV
infrastructure;
(c) Description of how water currently flows on the property;
(d) Size, location and elevation of all structures and driveways to be located on
the property. In the case of developments with multiple properties that will be developed at a
future time, a general description of the potential size and location of structures and driveways is
all that is required;
(e) Detailed plans for any proposed changes to drainage plans or drainage
structures;
(f) Detailed plans for any proposed changes to drainage easements and plans on
how they will be recorded; and
(g) In cases where there is an approved Drainage Plan for the development where
the property is located, the City Engineer may allow the petitioner to use the developments
Drainage Plan to serve as the Drainage Plan for an individual property in the development, if they
so desire, eliminating the need for an individual Drainage Plan for each property in the
development, in which case the property must be developed as defined in the developments
Drainage Plan and a foundation survey and post-development survey are still required for each
property as described below.
(3) All foundation inspections shall include a survey of the foundation that is
performed by a licensed professional surveyor. The survey must show that the foundation is
properly located on the property and that it is at the correct height before the foundation is
approved.
(4) All Drainage Plans must be verified with a post-development “as-built” survey by
a licensed professional surveyor that shows that the Drainage Plan was properly implemented as
approved. This survey must be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer. Any failures in
implementing the Drainage Plan must be corrected before a Certificate of Occupancy can be
issued for the property.
(5) All Fill Permit requests that are presented to the Plan Commission for approval
must include a Drainage Plan as described above and must have the post-development “as-built”
survey approved by the City Engineer as described above. The City Engineer may require
Drainage Plans and post-development “as-built” surveys on Fill Permits he/she approves if he/she
feels it is necessary.
(6) Building Permits for adding auxiliary structures on previously developed
properties or Demolition Permits for removing structures, do not require the creation of a Site
Plan or Drainage Plan as long as the construction of the new auxiliary structure or removal of the
existing structure does not negatively impact the drainage on the property. Before issuing a
Building Permit for the construction of an auxiliary structure or issuing a Demolition Permit, the
Building Commissioner may request the project be reviewed by the City Engineer, who may
require a Site Plan and/or Drainage Plan be created if he/she feels the project may negatively
impact the drainage on the property.
(H) Aesthetic and Financial Impact
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 227 Title XV
(1) Goals
(a) Minimize any negative financial impact on neighboring properties;
(b) Harmonize, generally, the appearance of new buildings with existing
buildings on neighboring properties;
(c) Encourage the development of buildings that maintain and enhance the
market value of surrounding properties;
(d) When possible, remedy existing aesthetic problems created by previous
development activities.
(2) Comparison with neighboring buildings and properties: The following characteristics
should be considered when comparing new buildings with existing buildings on neighboring
properties:
(a) Density;
(b) Square footage;
(c) Building set back;
(d) Ground floor elevation;
(e) Building height;
(f) Materials used on exterior of the buildings;
(g) Plantings and landscaping planned for the front yard;
(h) Style and size of fences.
(3) Submitted opinions of impact: Property owners, neighbors or other concerned
citizens may submit a Letter of Estimated Economic Impact from a Licensed Real Estate Broker
or Appraiser at the time the Site Plan is being reviewed in support or opposition of the planned
building or development. The Letter of Estimated Economic Impact should contain:
(a) Name of the owner, neighbor or other concerned citizen who is submitting the
letter;
(b) Name and signature of the Licensed Real Estate Broker or Appraiser who is
giving the opinion;
(c) Address of the property being developed; and
(d) Whether the Licensed Real Estate Broker or Appraiser believes the proposed
property being developed will have a positive, neutral or negative financial
impact on neighboring properties.

NON-CONFORMING USES AND NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS
§ 154.460 PURPOSE.
(A) The purpose of this subchapter is to describe non-conforming uses and non-conforming
buildings and the conditions that apply to their termination and removal, additions and
enlargements, repairs and maintenance, restoration and repair after damage or destruction and to
their continuation of use.
(B) Within the districts established by this chapter or by amendments which may later be
adopted, there exists; lots; structures; uses of land and structures; and, characteristics of use,
which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent to
permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed. It is further the intent of this
chapter that non-conformities, except as otherwise noted or required by law, shall not be made
more non-conforming, nor be used as the grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the district.
(Prior Code, § 24-199) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.461 INCOMPATIBILITY OF NON-CONFORMING USES.
Non-conforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in
the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land or a
non-conforming use of a structure and land in combination, shall not be extended or enlarged
after the passage of this chapter if the extension or enlargement makes the non-conforming
building or use more non-conforming. In addition, no additional signs intended to be seen from
off the premises or additional uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved, shall be permitted.
(Prior Code, § 24-200) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.462 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 247 Title XV
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction or designated use of a building on which the actual and physical construction
was lawfully begun prior to the enactment of this chapter and upon which actual physical
building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual physical construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition, or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the excavation or demolition, or removal shall be
deemed to be actual construction; provided, that the work shall be carried on diligently.
(Prior Code, § 24-201) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.463 SINGLE NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling may
be constructed on a non-conforming lot of record notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter. The lot must be in separate ownership and not be of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable within the
district; provided that, yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or
width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations of the district in which the lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Advisory Board of
Zoning Appeals.
(Prior Code, § 24-202) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.464 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
If 2 or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with contiguous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of enactment of this chapter or amendments thereto,
and if all or parts of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the
lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter, and
no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot
width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be
made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 24-203) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.465 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.
Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter, lawful uses of land exist which would not be
permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they
remain otherwise lawful; provided:
(A) No such non-conforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, except as may be required by law.
(B) No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot
or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this chapter, except as may be required by law.
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 248 Title XV
(C) If any such non-conforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned for more than 1
year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of the
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is
located.
(D) No additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter shall
be erected in connection with the non-conforming use of land.
(Prior Code, § 24-204) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.466 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that could not now be built under the terms of this chapter by reasons of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk or other requirements concerning the
structure, the structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions.
(A) No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its non-conformity, except as required by law, but any structure may be altered to decrease its
non-conformity.
(B) Should any non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a structure be
destroyed by any means to the extent that 50% of the fair market value of the building
immediately prior to the damage, it shall not be reconstructed, except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
(C) Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall
therefore conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(Prior Code, § 24-205) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.467 NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND
LAND IN COMBINATION.
If a lawful use involving individual structures, or if a structure and land in combination
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not now be
allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, this lawful use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
(A) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in
which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, moved, constructed, reconstructed, or structurally
altered, except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located, or except as required by law.
(B) A non-conforming use may be extended throughout any part of the building which were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building, except as
required by law.
(C) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 249 Title XV
use is substituted by a conforming use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district,
and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
(D) When a non-conforming use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination is
discontinued or abandoned for more than 1 year (except when government action impedes access
to the premises), the structures or structures and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used
except in conformance with the regulation of the district in which it is located.
(E) Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination,
removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the land.
(Prior Code, § 24-206) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.468 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use,
work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not to exceed 10% of
the current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure and market value of real estate,
provided that the cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of the official. If a non-conforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a non-conforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful by reason of
physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
(Prior Code, § 24-207) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.469 CHANGING THE USE OF A NON-CONFORMING USE.
A non-conforming use as described in this chapter shall not be changed to another use unless
the resultant use meets a use which is first permitted in the current zoning classification.
(Prior Code, § 24-208) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.480 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this section is to describe the process required for obtaining improvement
location permits and the conditions which have to be met in order to obtain them. It also deals
with occupancy permits. The issuance of the permits is absolutely critical for the implementation
of a zoning ordinance with respect to both temporary and permanent improvements to structures,
buildings and land.
(Prior Code, § 24-209) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.481 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL.
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 250 Title XV
The city hereby designates its city’s Engineer as the Administrator for the purpose of
implementing this chapter and has the principal responsibility for enforcing this chapter. The
Administrator may be assisted by other persons as the City of Hobart may direct. It shall be the
duty of the administrative official and the Plan Commission to enforce the provisions of this
chapter in the manner and form and with the powers provided by the state.
(Prior Code, § 24-210) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.482 APPLICABILITY.
No conditional use approved hereunder, no change in a flood plain district may be made
hereunder and no other change in the use of land (except an agricultural use) that involves a
change in any structure on or in any land or in the condition of the land, may be made unless the
Administrator on application, issues an improvement location permit authorizing the change. No
building permit for a principal building or use shall be issued, unless the property for which the
permit is being requested is a legal lot of record.
(Prior Code, § 24-211) (Ord. 96-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.483 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.

unless the applicant has also applied for a certificate of occupancy.
(B) No land or structure with respect to which an improvement location permit has been
issued under § 154.482 may be used for the purposes contemplated by the permit unless the
Administrator, after the change is completed, issues a certificate of occupancy stating that the
change complies with this chapter and with the permit.
(C) Within 10 days after the completion of the change authorized by the improvement
location permit, the Administrator or his or her designee shall inspect the premises and, if the
change conforms to this chapter and to the location improvement permit, and that a certificate of
compliance, if required by § 154.483, has been obtained, he or she shall issue a certificate of
occupancy.
(D) The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee may issue a temporary or partial
occupancy permit whenever, in the Administrator’s discretion, or in the discretion of the designee
he finds that:
(1) The construction of a project undertaken pursuant to proper building permit and
improvement location permit (where same is applicable) is substantially complete but for minor
or incidental items of work;
(2) An undue hardship to the owner of the property subject to said permits would
likely result from being denied the use or occupancy of the project pending the completion of
such items; and
(3) There is no risk to the health and safety of the occupiers of the project or the public
by allowing temporary or partial use or occupancy until said incomplete items of work are
completed.

City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 251 Title XV
(4) The fee provided for in sub-section (F) has been paid.
(Ord. 2013-06, § 1)
(E) The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall obtain evidence of the cost of
the work remaining incomplete at the time of request for issuance of a temporary or partial
occupancy permit, and shall require the owner or requesting party to post security for the payment
for completion of the work in the amount of One Hundred Ten percent (110%) of the amount
determined by the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee for the cost of the work
remaining incomplete. All work shall be completed by a date fixed by the Administrator or the
Administrator’s designee and stated in the temporary or partial occupancy permit. In the event
that the work is not completed by said date, the Administrator may apply such security to the cost
of completing the work, or withdraw the temporary or permanent occupancy permit, and order the
owner and occupiers of the property to vacate same.
(Ord. 2013-06, § 1)
(F) There is established a fee for the issuance of a temporary or partial occupancy permit
hereunder, to be paid by the owner or applicant, and collected by the Clerk-Treasurer, in the
amount set out in the current fee provisions of the Municipal Code.

(A) In addition to all other applications, information and permits from all other
governmental agencies, a person who applies for an improvement location permit under §
154.482 must furnish the Administrator with plans drawn to scale showing the following:
(1) The location and legal description of the land involved;
(2) The location and size of all buildings and structures already on the land and those
to be erected, including parking, signage, landscaping and screening;
(3) The size of all entrances to and exits from the land, including all adjacent streets

landscape plan upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, the relocation of any structures or
buildings, or of any entrance or exit, or the inclusion of entrances or exits not shown on the plan,
or the deletion of any entrance or exit, if the requirement is necessary in the interest of the public
welfare or to an appropriate balancing of the interests of the persons in the district and vicinity
involved.

accompanied by a certificate of compliance, certified by a registered professional engineer of the
state, stating that the use will meet the performance standards of the district concerned. After 10
working days have elapsed during which the Administrator has not required additional

location permit or deny the application together with a statement of reasons for the denial within a
period of 8 working days following its submittal, except for the longer period of time required for
industrial uses as provided in § 154.485.

BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
§ 154.500 PURPOSE.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 253 Title XV
The purpose of this section is to explain the makeup of, jurisdiction of and procedures to be
used by this Board. It should be noted that use variances are permitted by the state statute for
Advisory Boards of Zoning Appeals, but the practice of permitting them is not recommended.
Use variances have virtually the same affect as rezoning, but without benefit of Plan Commission
review for their relationship to the overall fabric of the comprehensive plan and the potential for
adverse consequences thereto. In most states such a delegation of de facto rezoning authority to
Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals is avoided.
(Prior Code, § 24-219) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.501 CREATED.
There is hereby reestablished the “Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Hobart,

Advisory Plan Commission; and
(B) One citizen member appointed by the Advisory Plan Commission who must be a
member of the Advisory Plan Commission other than the member appointed by the Common
Council of the City of Hobart.
(Prior Code, § 24-221) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.503 TERMS OF OFFICE.
Following adoption of this chapter, each of the above members shall be re-appointed for the
balance of the term being served on the present Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of
Hobart. Thereafter, each member, except those appointed from the Advisory Plan Commission
shall be for a term of 4 years. The members appointed from the Advisory Plan Commission shall
be for a term of 1 year. Each term shall expire on the first Monday of the year of termination.
(Prior Code, § 24-222) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.504 QUORUM.
The presence of 3 members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. No action of the Board is
official, however, unless authorized by a majority of the constituted Board.

district or classification; conditional uses; and 3 appeals, as provided by statute, and including
requirements for procurement of improvement location or occupancy permits or any ordinance
adopted under I.C. 36-7-4 or any prior zoning statute, and any other appeals authorized by statute.
(Prior Code, § 24-225) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.507 STAFF.
The staff of the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals shall consist of the Administrator as
defined in this chapter and such other persons employed by the City of Hobart as may from time
to time be assigned to assist him or her and the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals.

§ 154.511 HEARINGS.
All hearings required for variances, conditional uses, and appeals shall be by the Advisory
Board of Zoning Appeals. As per § 154.507, procedures for public notice setting forth time and
place for all hearings by the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals shall be established by the
Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Prior Code, § 24-230) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.512 CONDITIONAL USES.
In making its determination to grant or deny a request for a conditional use, the Advisory
Board of Zoning Appeals shall take into consideration all of the following factors.
(A) There shall be no classes of cases or applications, nor any particular situation in which
this chapter authorizes either special uses, special exceptions or contingent uses.
(B) The Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a conditional use in a district if,
after a hearing under § 154.511, it makes a finding of fact in writing, that:
(1) The requested conditional use is a listed conditional use in the district in which it is
proposed to be located;
(2) The requirements and development standards of the district in which the requested
conditional use is proposed to be located will be met; and
(3) Granting the conditional use will not subvert the general purposes served by this
chapter and will not, because of traffic generation, placement of outdoor lighting, noise
production or hours of operation, materially or permanently injure other property or uses in the
same zoning district and vicinity.
(C) The Advisory Board may impose such reasonable conditions upon its approval as it
deems necessary to find that division (B)(3) above will be served.
(D) The Advisory Board may permit or require the owner of the parcel of property to make
a written commitment concerning the use or development of the parcel as specified under I.C. 36-
7-4-921.
(E) The approval of a conditional use under division (B) above is unnecessary for a use that
was listed as a conditional use in the district in which it is requested if that use existed on the date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter. However, this shall not authorize the expansion of such
use if it involves the enlargement of a building, structure or land area.
(F) A conditional use approved by the Advisory Board may not be expanded, extended or
enlarged unless re-approved by the Advisory Board under the provisions set forth in this chapter
for approving a conditional use.
(G) A conditional use, approved under division (B) above or authorized by division (E)
above ceases to be authorized and is void if that use is not established within a 12-month period
of the date the conditional use was approved, or if that conditional use is discontinued at that site
Hobart - Land Usage
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 256 Title XV
for a 12-month period during which time it is not succeeded by the same specifically approved
conditional use.
(H) A conditional use may be terminated by the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals, upon
filing of an application by an interested person or the Administrator and, upon a finding at a
public hearing, with notice to the property owner, that the terms of this chapter or conditions of
approval or commitments have not been complied with.
(I) For a conditional use to be eligible for a public hearing by the Advisory Board under
this section, an applicant must first receive a determination from the Administrator that a
conditional use is required for the intended use or for the expansion, extension or enlargement of
a use under division (F) above. The Administrator shall file a report of determination (in a form
prescribed by the Advisory Board) with the Plan Commission which body shall determine how
the granting of a conditional use would affect the purposes served by this chapter in furtherance
of the comprehensive plan. Within 30 days of the date on which it received the application, the
Commission shall report its determination to the Advisory Board for action by it as authorized by
division (B) above. If the Advisory Board grants the conditional use, it shall direct the applicant
to apply for an improvement location permit under § 154.482. If the application complies with
this chapter and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, the Administrator shall issue the
improvement location permit for the approved conditional use.
(Prior Code, § 24-231) (Ord. 97-15; Ord. 2001-41)
§ 154.513 VARIANCES.
In making its determination to grant or deny a request for a variance, the Advisory Board of
Zoning Appeals shall take into consideration all of the following factors.
(A) The Advisory Board may grant a variance from the development standards (such as
height, bulk and area) of the zoning ordinance if, after a public hearing, it makes findings of fact
in writing, that:
(1) The Advisory Plan Commission has determined that the variance is not for a use
variance, i.e. a variance from a use district or classification per § 154.506.
(2) The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the community.
(3) (a) The strict application of the terms of this chapter:
1. Is being applied to some condition peculiar to the property involved that
is not common to other properties in the same zoning district; and
2. Will result in an unusual and unnecessary hardship.
(b) The situation shall not be solely self-imposed, nor be based on a perceived
reduction of or restriction on economic gain.
(B) The Advisory Board may permit or require the owner of a parcel to make written
commitment concerning the use or development of that parcel or may impose conditions upon
that grant of variance.
Zoning
City of Hobart Municipal Code Chapter 154 / Page 257 Title XV

writing, on a “not to exceed” basis. The Clerk-Treasurer shall provide to such official an estimate
of legal advertising and document recordation fees that will be required for the application. Such
official will prepare a reimbursement agreement in letter form, using a form to be prepared by the
City Attorney, specifying the estimated “not to exceed” professional fees and costs to be incurred
by the City based upon such written estimates, including legal advertising and recordation fees,
and requiring the developer to agree to reimburse the City for same in the manner required by this
chapter. In the event it is determined that such fees appear to be insufficient as estimated, such
City official and developer shall enter into good faith negotiations to amend the amount
authorized for reimbursement in the agreement or other conditions contained therein. The
agreement shall also require the payment of the deposit required under §155.06 of this chapter,
and provide for return of unused deposit or supplemental billings as also authorized by that
section. Reimbursement agreements under this section shall contain provisions binding the City
and developer, providing for enforcement thereof, including the recovery of attorney fees and
costs of suit, and shall be executed by the developer and the above-named official of the City
preparing the agreement.

Upon execution of the reimbursement agreement required by §155.05 of this chapter, the

professional fees, legal advertising and recordation fees and costs specified in the agreement. No
consideration shall be given by any board, council, commission or official of the City to the
application of the developer until such deposit is paid. Before the final action of the City board,
commission, council or official on the developer’s application for official land use action or an
official financing incentive action, the City shall give written notice to the developer of the final
sum of all fees and costs for professional services incurred by the City in evaluation and review
of the application to the developer, and the developer shall pay the City, in reimbursement
thereof, the balance of all such fees and costs incurred less deposits previously paid by the
developer. No final action shall be taken on the application until such payment is made. If the
sum of all deposits made by the developer with the City exceed the sum of all of such
professional fees and costs incurred by the City, the City shall promptly reimburse the balance to
the developer. If, after final action is taken, fees or costs are billed to the City for professional
services or legal advertising or recordation fees not previously billed, the applicant shall

reimburse the City for same promptly upon written invoice to the developer by the Clerk-

§155.08. LIMITATIONS AND WAIVERS.

exceed the actual sum of professional fees and costs, legal advertising and recordation fees
incurred by the City. For good cause shown, the Board of Public Works and Safety of the City
may reduce or waive any of the obligations imposed upon a developer by this chapter. The term
“good cause” means the existence of a severe financial hardship upon the developer if the
provisions of this chapter were applied without change, or the imposition upon a non-profit or
governmental entity of a substantial financial burden that would interfere with its service to the
community. The determination of the Board of Public Works and Safety shall be final and
binding.
(Ord. 2010-18)
§155.09. SEVERABILITY.
