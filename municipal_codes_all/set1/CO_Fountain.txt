2.04.010 Title.  This Code shall be known and may be cited as the City of Fountain Code of Ethics for City Officials.  (Ord. 1133 §1, 2001) 
2.04.020 Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply to all sections of this Code of Ethics: 
A. "Appointee" shall include those persons appointed by the City Council or the City Manager to act on boards or commissions or those appointed by such boards or commissions.  It does not include or cover any compensated full-time or part-time City employee unless such person is also a board or commission member. 
B. "City" shall mean the City of Fountain, County of El Paso, State of Colorado. 
C. "City Official" shall mean City Council Members including the Mayor and all Appointees. (Ord, 1133 §2, 2001) 
2.04.030 Declaration of Purpose.  Proper democratic government requires that government officials and their appointees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that decisions and policies be made through proper government channels; that public office not be used for personal gains; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.  Recognizing these requirements, this Code of Ethics for City Officials sets forth standards of ethical conduct for all City Officials.  It identifies actions incompatible with the City's best interests and calls for disclosures by City Officials and of private, judicial or other interests affecting the City.  (Ord, 1133 §3, 2001) 
2.04.040 Finding of Local Concern.  The City of Fountain City Council hereby finds and determines that the matter of ethical municipal government is a matter of local concern upon which Colorado home rule municipalities are empowered to legislate and to supersede conflicting State statutes and common law.  (Ord, 1133 §4, 2001) 
2.04.050 Responsibilities of Public Office.  City Officials are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the people. They are bound to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States and the State of Colorado, and to uphold the Home Rule Charter and laws of the City of Fountain. They are bound to observe the highest standards of integrity and fairness. They must discharge the duties of office faithfully, regardless of personal considerations. Their conduct on the job must be above reproach, and they should avoid even the appearance of impropriety, conflict of interest or improper influence in the performance of official duties. (Ord, 1133 §5, 2001) 
2.04.060 Preparation for Meetings and Education.  City Officials will come properly prepared for all meetings.  They will also assure they are familiar with the pertinent laws that govern their activities including, but not limited to this Code of Ethics, the City Charter and the Open Meeting Laws of the State of Colorado. They will follow applicable City Ordinances pertaining to meetings and assure meetings maintain proper decorum and dignity.  (Ord, 1133 §6, 2001) 
2.04.070 Dedicated Services. All City Officials should be loyal to the political objectives expressed by the electorate while keeping the best interests of the City of Fountain, as a whole, in mind. City Officials have the right to express and support contrary or dissenting opinions provided that their expression or support is not intended to subvert or undermine any such objectives, the City's programs or the democratic process. When they do so, their comments should be made with integrity, respect for others and their opinions and for the democratic process. They shall not breach the law nor ask others to do so nor exceed their authority. They should work in cooperation with other public officials, unless prohibited by law, confidentially or the provision of this Code or the City Charter. In all actions they should avoid even the appearance of impropriety. (Ord, 1133 §7, 2001) 
2.04.080 Fair and Equal Treatment.  No City Official shall engage in any ex-parte communication if such communication is intended or may be reasonably expected to influence decisions or conduct in order to obtain favored treatment, special consideration or to advance personal or private interest involving quasi-judicial matters under consideration by such City Official, to the end that interested parties are denied equal opportunity to express and represent their interest. Ex-parte communication can be written or oral and are those that take place without notice to other interested parties and at a time and place other than a public meeting. Any ex-parte communication received by a City Official shall be entered into the record of any proceeding to which it relates by the recipient.  Any City Official who has engaged in ex-parte communication shall not, automatically, be deemed disqualified with respect to any proceeding to which the communication relates unless the official feels that the ex-parte communication has made it impossible for him or her to act objectively or if the other associated members determine by majority vote that such communication would reasonably appear to prevent that official from acting objectively. (Ord, 1133 §8, 2001) 
2.04.090 Conflict of Interest. 
A. All City Officials shall be familiar and comply with the requirements of the City Charter regarding Conflict of Interest as specifically set out in Section 2.14(c) of the City of Fountain Charter. 
B. Any City Official who believes he or she may have a conflict of interest shall disclose the potential conflict to the board or commission upon which the person serves, or, if none, to the City Council or the board or commission that appointed him or her.  Further, if any member of the City Council or such board or commission believes that another City Official on his or her board has a conflict, he or she shall bring the matter to the attention of the relevant board, commission or City Council prior to consideration of the pertinent issue. The City Council or appointing board or commission shall determine, by majority vote, whether a conflict of interest exists. If it determines that an actual conflict of interest exists, unless otherwise permitted by law, the City Official shall leave the board or commission panel until the next agenda item is taken up, shall not attempt to influence any other member regarding the issue, and shall not vote upon such matter. 
C. The following conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest are given for purposes of example, but not limitation.  
1. 
General Conflicts of Interest.  No City Official shall engage in any business or financial transaction or have other personal interest, direct or indirect, vested or contingent, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or which would tend to impair independent judgment in the performance of such official duties.  Personal interests include, but are not limited to, those arising from blood or family relationship or close business or political association. 

2. 
Disclosure of Confidential Information.  No City Official shall disclose confidential information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the City, without proper legal authorization, or use such information to advance personal, financial or private interest. This provision is not intended to impair or limit public access to information that is in fact public.  

3. 
Gifts and Favors.  No City Official shall accept any valuable gift, service, loan, favor, thing, promise or other consideration from any person or group directly or indirectly interested in the business dealings with the City which may tend to influence or appear to influence the discharge of duties or give the appearance of such influence.  Nor shall any City Official grant any improper gift, favor, service or thing of value in the discharge of official duties. 

4. 
Representation of Private Interest.  No City Official shall appear on behalf of private interests before any agency of the City, other than in matters in front of Municipal Court where that City Official is a Defendant, without prior approval of the City Council, nor shall any City Official represent private interests in any action or proceeding against the City or accept any compensation contingent upon any specific action by any City agency.  Not with standing, a City Council member may appear before City agencies on behalf of constituents in performing his duties and public obligations or on behalf of other public or quasi-public organizations. 

5. 
Contracts with the City.  All contracts with the City by the Mayor and City Council Members are governed by Section 2.14 of the City Charter.  Appointees shall be treated as City Council Members are in Section 2.14(c). 

6. 
Disclosure of Interest in Legislation or Judicial Matters.  Any City Official with a financial or private interest in any legislation or matter pending before the municipal court shall disclose that interest to the City Clerk and refrain from voting on and participating in the matter.  

7. 
Incompatible Employment.  No City Official shall engage in any private employment or render any private services, where such employment or service is incompatible with official duties or which would tend to impair independence in performing official duties.  (Ord, 1133 §9, 2001) 


2.04.100 Reporting of Improper Conduct by City Officials. If an individual City Official believes another City Official is acting improperly or violating provisions of this Ethics, the matter shall be discussed and decided by the City Council.  Individual City Officials shall not take any action or make any statement that would tend to lead the public or media to have the impression that other City Officials are acting improperly in their reporting, hearing or deciding upon whether or not there has been a violation of this Code except as may be reasonably necessary to protect that person’s Constitutional Rights.  (Ord, 1133 §10, 2001) 
2.04.110 Interpretation of the Code.  In case of doubt about the applicability or interpretation of any provision of this Code, application in writing should be made to the City Council for an advisory opinion.  The City Official shall have the opportunity to present any interpretation of the facts of applicable provisions before advice is rendered.  Upon receipt of such written request for advice, the City Council shall appoint an Ethics Committee composed of three (3) persons: one council member, one member of a standing City Board or Commission, and one City Appointee. Neither the City Attorney nor City Manager may act on the Ethics Committee.  Thereafter, the Ethics Committee shall hear the petitioning City Official and shall render its opinion to both the petitioner and the City Council within ten (10) days of such hearing. (Ord, 1133 §11, 2001) 

2.04.120 Sanctions. 
A. Violation of any provision of this Code should raise conscientious questions for City Officials concerning the need for voluntary resignation.

3. 
In the case of an Appointee, if a violation is established to the satisfaction of a majority of the council, such violation shall be grounds for an official reprimand by the City Council and grounds for termination of such person's appointment to any board or commission of which he or she is a member.  If the City Council votes to terminate the appointment of such Appointee upon such grounds, the City Council may appoint another person to fulfill the term of the individual removed from office; and 

4. 
The City Council may caution or reprimand the City Official responsible or take such other action as it deems to be in the best interests of the City of Fountain.  (Ord, 1133 §12, 2001) 


2.04.130 Severability.  If any provision of this Code of Ethics or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Code of Ethics which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Code of Ethics article are declared to be severable.

2.14.120 Types of Employees. 
A. Regular Full-Time Employees.  An employee who has been appointed to a regular full-time position and has successfully completed the probationary period shall become a regular, full-time employee. Such employees are normally required to work at least 40 hours per week for the entire year.  Such employees are entitled to all of the employee fringe benefits set forth in this chapter. 
B. Temporary Employees.  Employees who are appointed to a temporary position are considered temporary employees and are not entitled to employee fringe benefits. 
C. Probationary Employees. Except for sworn law enforcement personnel who are subject to a twelve-month probationary period, all new employees hired for a regular, full-time position shall serve a probationary period of six months.  The purpose of the probationary period is to provide an ongoing evaluation of the employee's ability to perform the duties of the position. Each employee shall receive a written review at the end of the probationary period.  At any time during or at the end of the probationary period, the department head, at his or her pleasure, may recommend to the City Manager immediate termination of a probationary employee.  Although such employees may file complaints as set forth in Part VI, they shall have no right to appeal any disciplinary action taken against them. 
Upon recommendation of the supervisor or department head a probationary period may be extended for an additional six (6) months by the City Manager.  At the completion of the probationary period, the employee shall either be made a regular full-time employee or shall be terminated. 
The promotion or transfer of an employee from one department to another does not necessarily mandate a new or extended probationary period.  However, if and when the head of the receiving department determines that the situation reasonably and appropriately deserves a period of probation, the department head may condition the transfer or promotion into the department upon the employee's agreement to accept probationary status for any period not to exceed the normal probationary period for that department.  If the employee elects not to accept the transfer or promotion because of the requirement for probation, the employee may not be disciplined for refusing to accept the probation, and may stay in the current employment position subject to the normal employment conditions as set forth in this manual.  (Ord. 801 §1, 1988; Ord. 1016 §4, 1995) 
D. Contractual Employees. Individuals who are hired on a full or part-time basis to complete a specific task within a specified time frame.  Such contractors are not eligible for employee fringe benefits, except as specifically set forth in the individual's contract.  (Ord. 801 §1, 1988)

The City Manager may consider the following factors in allowing such members to continue within the same department: whether job performance of any employee is affected by the relationship; whether the relationship is contrary to department morale or disruptive to the operation of that department; whether there are any actual or potential conflicts of interest resulting from the relationship; and whether it is in the best interests of the City to continue the employment of members of the immediate family or household within the same department.

2.14.200 Outside Employment.

5.06.154 Judicial Review of Hearings. The District Court within and for the County of El Paso shall review all determinations of the City Treasurer made under the provisions of Section 5.06.152 under Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure as the same now provides or may be hereinafter amended.

B. Money In Lieu of Bond. Taxpayer may deposit the disputed amount with the City Treasurer in lieu of posting a surety bond.  If such amount is so deposited, no further interest shall accrue on the deficiency contested during the pendency of the action.  At the conclusion of the action, after appeal to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals or after the time for the appeal has expired, the funds deposited shall be, at the direction of the court, either retained by the City Treasurer and applied against the deficiency or returned in whole or in part to the Taxpayer with interest at the rate imposed pursuant to Section 5.06.122.

A. 	For purposes of this section, “State hearing” means a hearing before the Executive Director of the Department of Revenue of the State or delegate thereof as provided in 
C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3). 
B. When the City asserts that Tax is due in an amount greater than the amount paid by Taxpayer, City shall mail a Deficiency Notice to Taxpayer by certified mail.  The Deficiency Notice shall state the additional Tax due and shall contain notification, in clear and conspicuous type, that Taxpayer has the right to elect a State hearing on the deficiency pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3). Taxpayer shall also have the right to elect a State hearing on the City’s denial of Taxpayer’s claim for a refund of Tax paid. 
C. Taxpayer shall request the State hearing within thirty (30) days after Taxpayer’s exhaustion of local remedies.  Taxpayer shall have no right to such hearing if he has not exhausted local remedies or if he fails to request the hearing within the time period provided in this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, “exhaustion of local remedies” means: 
1. 
Taxpayer has timely requested in writing an administrative hearing as provided in 5.06.151 and the hearing has been held in conformity with its provisions, or 

2. 
Taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the City and the City has failed to hold the hearing or has failed to issue a final decision on it within the time period prescribed in 5.06.151(D)(6). 


D. If Taxpayer has exhausted his local remedies as provided in Subsection C, Taxpayer may request a State hearing on the Deficiency Notice or claim for refund, and the request shall be made and the hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as set forth in C.R.S. § 29-2­106.1(3)-(7). 
E. If the Deficiency Notice or claim for refund involves only the City, in lieu of requesting a State hearing, Taxpayer may appeal such Deficiency Notice or denial of a claim for refund to the District Court of the County of El Paso, as provided in C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(8), provided the Taxpayer complies with the procedures set forth in Subsection C. 
5.06.157 Notices; Manner of Delivery. All notices required to be given to any Person under this Article shall be in writing and, if mailed, shall be postpaid by certified or registered mail, “return receipt requested,” directed to him at his last known address.  This mailing shall be sufficient for the purpose of this Article. (Ord. 1136, §1, 2001) 
5.06.160 Inter-City Claims for Recovery. The intent of this Section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where Tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the Taxpayer or Retailer to correctly pay, collect, and remit Tax to the City. 
A. As used herein, “claim for recovery” means a claim for reimbursement of Tax paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
B. When it is determined by the City Treasurer that Tax owed to the City has been reported and paid to another municipality, the City shall promptly notify the Retailer that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that, as of the date of the notice, the Retailer must cease improper Tax collections and remittances. 
C. The City may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received the Tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the City, or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the Tax from the Taxpayer or Retailer.  The decision to make a claim for a recovery lies in the sole discretion of the City.  Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the Taxpayer and/or Retailer releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The municipality to which the City submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
D. Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the City shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the Tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision.  If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the City shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality, submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of approval.  If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a Retailer or Taxpayer, the Check shall be made to the parties jointly.  Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
E. The City may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same Taxpayer. 
F. The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the thirty-six (36) month period prior to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the Tax receives the claim for recovery. (Ord. 1136, §1, 2001) 
5.06.170 Lien on Property. 
5.06.171 Tax Constitutes Lien. The Tax, together with the interest and penalties herein provided and the costs of collection which may be incurred, shall be and until paid, remain a first and prior lien superior to all other liens upon the Tangible Personal Property sold, Purchased, Stored, Used, Distributed or Consumed, as well as upon the goods, merchandise, furniture and fixtures, tools, equipment, cash, bank accounts and accounts receivable, of any Retailer, or used by any Retailer in conducting his Business.  The lien shall be subject only to a valid mortgage or other liens of record on and prior to the recording of notice as required herein. 
A. Construction Materials. The full amount of the Tax due and not paid for lumber, fixtures or any other Construction Materials, together with penalties and interest thereon as herein provided, shall constitute a lien upon the real property benefitted by such work.  The City Treasurer is hereby authorized to file a notice of the lien with the County Clerk and Recorder of El Paso County. 
B. Personal Property Affixed to Real Property. The full amount of unpaid Tax arising from and required to be reported on personal property affixed to real property under this Chapter, together with interest and penalties, shall constitute a first and prior lien on the real property and any proceeds therefrom, which lien shall have precedence over all other liens of whatsoever kind and nature, except as to liens for general taxes created by State law and except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or Consumer whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice of tax lien on the property of the Taxpayer other than on the goods, stock in trade and Business fixtures of the Taxpayer. 
C. Status of Unpaid Tax in Bankruptcy and Receivership. When the Business or property of any Taxpayer subject to this Chapter shall be placed in a receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors or seized under distraint for property or State taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this Chapter shall constitute a first, prior and preferred lien against all the property of the Taxpayer, except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor, or Consumer whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice on the property of the Taxpayer.  However, the goods, stock in trade, cash, deposits, accounts receivable, and Business fixtures of the Taxpayer shall not be subject to the above-stated exception and the Tax, penalties and interest shall be and remain a first, prior and preferred lien against the property of Taxpayer.  No sheriff, receiver, assignee, or other officer shall sell the property of any Person subject to this Chapter under process or order of any court, when that property is subject to a prior recorded City tax lien, except after notice of the Sale date is given to the City. If a Tax is due, owing and unpaid, it shall be the duty of the officer to first pay the amount of the Tax out of the proceeds of the Sale before making payment of any moneys to any judgment creditor or any other claimants of whatsoever kind or nature, except the costs of the proceedings and other preexisting claims or liens. 
5.06.172 Notice of Tax Lien. If the Tax and any penalty or interest is not paid within five (5) days after it is due, the City Treasurer shall issue a notice, setting forth the name of the Taxpayer, the amount of the Tax, penalties and interest, and the date of the accrual thereof.  The notice shall also state that the City claims a first and prior lien on the Tangible Personal Property of the Taxpayer.  Such notice shall be on forms prepared by the City Treasurer and shall be verified by him or her (or authorized agent) and may be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in this State in which the Taxpayer owns Tangible Personal Property, and the filing of the notice shall create a lien on the property in that county and constitute notice of it.  After the notice has been filed or concurrently therewith or at any time when Tax due is unpaid, whether such notice be filed or not, the City Treasurer may issue a distraint warrant as provided herein. 
5.06.173 City a Party to Title Actions For Determination of Liens. In any action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property the City may be made a party for the purpose of obtaining a judgment or determination of its lien upon the property involved. 
5.06.174 Filing and Release of Liens. Any employee, agent or representative of the City Treasurer to whom a warrant has been issued, pursuant to Section 5.06.181, may serve a notice of lien in such form as the City Treasurer may prescribe upon the Person in possession of any personal property or rights on property belonging to the Taxpayer and if not previously recorded the lien shall be effective as to the property or interest from the date of the service.  The City Treasurer may release the lien as to all or any part of the property or any interest subject to the lien upon such terms as he may deem proper. 
5.06.175 Certificate of Discharge. 
A. Conditions Precedent. If any property, real or personal, shall be subject to a lien for payment of Tax, the City Treasurer may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if (1) he or she finds that the fair market value of that part of the property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the liability remaining unsatisfied in respect to the Tax and the amount of prior liens upon the property or (2) the City Treasurer receives in part satisfaction of the Tax liability an amount not less than the value of the interest of the City in the part to be discharged, as determined by the City Treasurer. 
B. How Value is Determined. In determining values, the City Treasurer shall give consideration to the fair market value of the part to be discharged and to such lien or liens thereon as shall have priority over the lien of the City. 
C. Certificate of Release Conclusive. A certificate of release or of partial discharge issued under this part shall be held conclusive that the lien of the City upon the property released therein is extinguished, but shall not extinguish nor release any portion of the lien property not specified in the release. (Ord. 1136, §1, 2001) 
5.06.180 Methods of Enforcing Collection. 
5.06.181 Foreclosure by Distraint. Liens created hereunder may be foreclosed by seizing under distraint warrant and selling so much of the merchandise, furniture and fixtures, tools and equipment, or other property not otherwise excluded as may be necessary to discharge the liens. 
A. Warrant by City Treasurer. When any of the subparagraphs of this subsection are met, the City Treasurer may issue a warrant directed to any employee, agent, or representative of the City Treasurer, sometimes in this section referred to collectively as “agent” or “revenue collector,” commanding him to distrain, seize, and sell the personal property of the Taxpayer, except such personal property as is exempt from execution and Sale by any statute of this State for the payment of the Tax, together with penalties and interest accrued thereon and costs of execution.

1. 
The premises to which entry is sought contain property that is subject to levy and Sale to pay the Tax; and 

2. 
At least one of the preconditions of the subparagraph A of this Section has been satisfied, provided that if the City Treasurer has declared a jeopardy assessment under Section 5.06.182, he sets forth the reasons that collection of the Tax will be jeopardized.

The procedures to be followed in issuing and executing a warrant pursuant to Subsection B shall comply with Rule 241© and (D) of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure, provided that an officer authorized by law under Rule 241© and (B) shall include the City Treasurer.

The Taxpayer may contest a warrant previously issued under the procedure provided by Rule 241(E) of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure, except that no proceeding to contest such warrant may be brought after five (5) days prior to the date fixed for Sale of the distrained property. 
E. Notice of Distraint Seizure. The agent charged with the collection shall make or cause to be made an account of the goods or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the agent making such distraint, shall be left with the owner or possessor, at his usual place of abode with some member of his family over the age of eighteen (18) years, or at his usual place of Business with his stenographer, bookkeeper, or chief clerk, or if the Taxpayer is a corporation, shall be left with any officer, manager, general agent or agent for process, with a note of the sum demanded and the time and place of Sale; and shall forthwith cause to be published a notice of the time and place of Sale, together with a description of the property to be sold, in a Newspaper within the county where distraint is made or, in lieu thereof and in the discretion of the City Treasurer, the agent shall cause such notice to be publicly posted at the courthouse of the county where the distraint is made and copies to be posted in at least two (2) other public places within the county.

The Sale may be adjourned from time to time by the agent if he deems it advisable, but not for a time to exceed ninety (90) days from the date first fixed for the Sale. When any personal property is advertised for Sale under distraint as aforesaid, the agent making the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public Auction, offering the same at not less than a fair minimum Price, including the expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the Sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the Sale is not equal to the fair minimum Price so fixed, the agent conducting the Sale may declare the same to be purchased by him for the City.  The property purchased may be sold by the agent under such regulations as may be prescribed by the City Treasurer. 
G. Recovery of Property by Owner. In any case of distraint for the payment of taxes, the Tangible Personal Property distrained shall be restored to the owner or possessor if, prior to the Sale, the amount due is paid together with the fees and other charges, or may be redeemed by a Person holding a security interest or other evidence of right of possession. 
H. Certificate of Sale; Evidence of Purchase. In all cases of Sale, the agent making the Sale shall issue a certificate of Sale to each Consumer.  The certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the agent to make the Sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his proceedings in making the Sale; and shall transfer to the Consumer all right, title and interest of the delinquent Taxpayer in and to the property sold.  Where the property consists of a certificate of stock in the possession of the agent, the certificate of Sale shall be notice when received, to any corporation, company or association of said transfer, and the certificate of sale shall be authority for the corporation, company or association to record the transfer on its books and records.  Where the subject of Sale is securities or other evidences of debt, in the possession of the agent, the certificate of Sale shall be good and valid evidence of title in the Person holding it.

5.08.010 Purpose. 
A. The purpose of this part is to provide for the licensing and regulation of pawnbrokers in conformity with the provisions of Article 56 of Title 12, C.R.S.  The City hereby finds and determines that it is necessary to regulate and license the business of pawnbroking as provided in Section 12-56-102, C.R.S. and that certain regulations more restrictive than provided in Article 56 of Title 12, C.R.S. are appropriate. 
B. The City hereby finds and determines that law enforcement officers are hindered in the identification and recovery of articles which may be subject to a contract for purchase unless there is provided a record keeping system by pawnbrokers for tangible personal property purchased by a pawnbroker or subject to a contract for purchase.  Furthermore, the requirement of  a retention period by persons engaged in the business of pawnbroking is necessary to assist the police department in the recovery of such articles on behalf of the rightful owner. 
C. Accordingly, in the interest of safeguarding the public health, safety and welfare, it is the intent of the City, by enacting this Chapter, to aid law enforcement officers in the discovery and identification of sellers of stolen tangible personal property, which is the subject of a contract for purchase or purchased by a pawnbroker, by requiring the licensing of person engaged in the business of pawnbroking, by providing a mandatory record keeping and reporting system by such businesses, and by providing a retention period during which such tangible personal property may not be altered or disposed of.

A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission or possession which strongly corroborates the firmness of the actor's intent to complete the commission of the violation.  Factual or legal impossibility of committing the violation is not a defense if the violation could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be, nor is it a defense that the violation attempted was actually perpetrated by the accused.

9.52.010 Legislative Declaration:  The City Council finds and determines as follows: Sections 25-14-203 (7) and 24-14-207 (2) (a) C.R.S., sections of the Colorado Clean Indoor Act, Part 29 of Article 14 of Title 25 C.R.S., establish a smoking prohibition within an area that has a radius of fifteen feet from an entryway to a building or facility.  Sections 25-14-203 (7) and 25-14­207 (2) (a) C.R.S. permit a municipality as a local authority to reduce the radius of the area included within an entryway to less than fifteen feet.  The City Council finds that the area included within a fifteen feet radius from the entryway to a building or facility is an unrealistic limitation on smoking. Such fifteen foot prohibition may extend into public parking lots or other public areas and does not provide an area reasonably close to a building or other facility for containers for the disposal of lighted cigarettes, lighted cigars and other smoking products before entering a building or facility. The City Council finds that a reduction of the radius from fifteen feet is five feet is an appropriate balance between the interests of smokers and nonsmokers.  (Ord. 1364, §2, 2007)

10.9 of the Home Rule Charter (the “Charter”) of the City of Fountain, Colorado (the “City”) to 
prescribe procedures with respect to local or special improvement districts (“improvement districts”).  (Ord. 673 §1, 1984) 
12.32.020 Statutes Superseded.  Pursuant to Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Charter, Part 5 of Article 25, Chapter 31, C.R.S., and all other statutes or portions of statutes relating to the creation of improvement districts or the levying of assessments for improvements, or the issuance of special assessments bonds, are hereby superseded.  (Ord. 673 §2, 1984) 
12.32.030 Improvements – Assessment Units.  The improvements for which the City Council of the City (the “Council”) may create improvement districts may consist of any special or local improvements of every character which confer special benefits on property within the improvement district in addition to the general benefits conferred on the City at large.  Improvement districts may be created for the purchase, other acquisition, repair, restoration or maintenance of existing works or improvements, or for the construction, installation or other acquisition of new or additional improvements, or any combination thereof (collectively, “improvements”).  More than one kind of improvement districts may consist of noncontiguous territory.  The Council may provide for an improvement district to consist of more than one assessment unit if the Council determines that, due to differences in cost, character, nature or location of the improvements, the costs can be more equitably assessed by means of separate assessment units within the improvement district.  (Ord. 673 §3, 1984) 
12.32.040 Creation of Improvement Districts – Engineering Materials.  The City Manager or the Council shall direct the engineer or engineering firm employed or designated by the City to prepare and present to the Council the following:

B. An estimate of the probable total cost of such improvements, which may include the cost of constructing or otherwise acquiring, installing, repairing, restoring and maintaining the improvements, and engineering, legal and advertising costs, collection costs, interest during construction and until interest on any installation payments of assessments is expected to be received by the City, and any other incidental costs; and 
C. A map of the improvement district which is to be assessed for the cost of the improvements.  (Ord. 673 §4, 1984) 
12.32.050 Creation of Improvement Districts – First Reading of Creation Ordinance.  Upon such materials being presented to the Council, the Council shall consider the adoption on first reading of an ordinance creating the improvement district (the “creation ordinance”).  The publication of the creation ordinance after first reading, as provided in the Charter, shall constitute notice of the public hearing on the creation of the improvement district.  The creation ordinance shall generally describe the nature and location of the improvements to be made, without mentioning minor details, and describe the area to be included within the improvement district, by boundaries or other brief description.  The creation ordinance shall describe: 
A. The extent of the improvement district to be assessed (by boundaries or other brief description) and the assessment units, if any; 
B. The kind of improvements (without mentioning minor details); 
C. The probable total cost, including incidentals, as shown by the estimate of the engineer, which estimate shall not constitute a limitation upon the cost of the project nor for any other purpose; 
D. The estimated portion of the cost of the improvements to be paid by the City and not be assessment, if any; 
E. The basis of assessment; and 
F. The date, time and place of the public hearing on the creation of the improvement district, which may also be the date, time and place at which the Council will consider the creation ordinance on second reading.  (Ord. 673 §5, 1984) 
12.32.060 Notice of Hearing on Creation.  Notice of the public hearing on the creation of the improvement district shall be given by publishing the creation ordinance one time, and by posting the creation ordinance, as provided in the Charter.  The City Clerk shall, by registered or certified mail, send a copy of the creation ordinance to the last known address of each last known owner within the improvement district whose property assessment rolls for general (ad valorem) taxes of El Paso County, Colorado, wherein the property is located.  Any such list of names and addresses pertaining to any improvement district may be revised more frequently from time to time, but such a list need not be revised more frequently than at twelve (12) month intervals.  The creation ordinance shall be published, posted and mailed at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. (Ord. 673 §6, 1984) 
12.32.070 Public Hearing on Creation – Protests – Second Reading of Creation Ordinance. At the public hearing on the creation of the improvement district, the Council shall consider protests submitted by owners of property within the improvement district, as to the creation of the improvement district or other matters set forth in the creation ordinance.

Protests must include the name and address of the protesting property owner, a reasonable description of reasons for the protest.  After the public hearing, the Council may, in its sole discretion, either adopt the creation ordinance on second reading, with such modifications or deletions, if any, as the Council may deem appropriate, or abandon the proceedings.  (Ord. 673 §7, 1984) 
12.32.080 Additional Plans and Specifications – Changes.  After the improvement district has been created, the City shall direct the engineer to prepare such additional plans and specifications as may be necessary to provide greater detail or to reflect any modifications made by the Council after the public hearing.

Contracts for improvement districts may be combined with contracts for other City work.  (Ord. 673 §9, 1984) 
12.32.100 Basis for Assessments.  Whenever any improvement district is created, the cost of the improvements, or the portion thereof to be defrayed by special assessments, shall be assessed against tracts or parcels of land included within the improvement district specially benefited thereby, but not including any tract or parcel owned by the United States of America or any agency, instrumentality or corporation thereof, or any streets or public highways.  Such special assessments may be apportioned on any equitable basis, as may be determined by the Council.  (Ord. 673 §10, 1984) 
12.32.110 Assessments Against Public Property.  When the City, county, school district or any other political subdivision (other than the United States of America or any agency, instrumentality or corporation thereof) owns any tract of land not used as a street or public highway, which if owned by a private person would be liable to assessment for benefits to pay for improvements, an assessment shall be made against the land as though the land were the property of the private person. If the assessment is not paid as provided in the assessing ordinance, suit may be brought to enforce the collection of the assessment, and the judgment may be rendered against political subdivision, but no such land shall be sold under any such judgment.  (Ord. 673 §11, 1984) 
12.32.120 Equitable Adjustments.  When any property is “V” shaped or of any irregular form, or whenever the Council otherwise determines that adjustment is required in order to make the assessment proportionate to the benefit, the Council may, upon the recommendation of the engineer, make such allowance in the assessment on such property as seems equitable or just, so that the assessment against such property shall be in proportion to the special benefits thereby derived, if such were not the case in the absence of such an adjustment.  (Ord. 673 §12, 1984) 
12.32.130 Preparation of Assessment Roll.  At such time as the estimated costs of the improvements or any portion thereof are, in the judgment of the Council or the City Manager, reasonably ascertainable, the engineer shall, on direction of the Council or the City Manager, prepare a statement showing the total estimated cost of the improvements or of such portion thereof including incidental costs.  The engineer also shall prepare an assessment roll which shall contain: 
A. The names of the last known owners of the property to be assessed or, if not known, a statement to the effect that the name is unknown; 
B. A description of each tract or parcel of land to be assessed; and 
C. The amount of the assessment thereon. 
The engineer shall certify the assessment roll to the Council by filing the same in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord. 673 §13, 1984) 
 12.32.140 First Reading of Assessment Ordinance.  When the assessment roll is so certified and filed, the Council shall consider the adoption on first reading of an ordinance levying the assessments (the “assessment ordinance”).  The publication of the assessment ordinance after first reading, as provided in the Charter, shall constitute notice of the public hearing on the assessment roll. Such ordinance shall state: 
A. That such assessment roll is on file in the City Clerk’s office; 
B. The date of filing the same; 
C. The basis of assessment; and 
D. The date, time and place of the public hearing on the assessment roll, which may 
also be the date, time and place at which the Council will consider the assessment ordinance on second reading.  (Ord. 673 §14, 1984) 
12.32.150 Notice of Hearing on Assessment Roll.  Notice of the public hearing on the assessment roll shall be given by publishing the assessment ordinance one time, and by posting the assessment ordinance, as provided in the Charter.  The City Clerk shall, by registered or certified mail, send a copy of such ordinance to the last known address of each last known owner of land within the improvement district whose property will be assessed for the cost of the improvements, such addresses and owners being those appearing on the real property assessment rolls for general (ad valorem) taxes of el Paso County, Colorado, wherein said property is located.  Any such list of names and addresses pertaining to any improvement district may be revised more frequently than at twelve (12) month intervals.

Protests must include the name and address of the protesting property owner, a reasonable description of the property to which the protest relates, and a statement of the reasons for the protest.  After such hearing, the Council shall adopt the assessment ordinance on second reading with such modifications as the Council may deem appropriate, if any.  Such ordinance shall be a final determination of the regularity, validity and correctness of the proceedings relating to the assessment roll, of each assessment contained therein, and of the amount of each assessment levied on each tract and parcel of land, and such determination by the Council shall be conclusive upon the owners of the property assessed; provided, however, that if assessments are levied on the basis of less than the entire cost of the improvements to be assessed, additional assessments may subsequently be levied for the remaining costs to be assessed.  (Ord. 673 §16, 1984)

(Ord. 673 §18, 1984) 
12.32.190 Remedies for Defective Assessments.  No delays, mistakes, errors, defects or irregularities in any act or proceedings authorized by this ordinance shall prejudice or invalidate any final assessment but the same shall be remedied by subsequent or amended acts or proceedings as the case may require, and when so remedied, the same shall take effect as of the date of the original act or proceeding. (Ord. 673 §19, 1984)

2. In the event that a previously used service line is not used for a continuous period of five (5) years or more, such service line shall be deemed to be abandoned, unless a letter of agreement is entered into between the customer and the Water Department.  When a service line is deemed to be abandoned, there shall be no further obligation on the Water Department to provide water to that service line.  The obligation to serve shall not again arise except upon reapplication in accordance with all ordinances then applicable and the payment of all fees due at the time of the reapplication.

I. INTRODUCTION 
13.16.010 General Statement.  The following rules and regulations shall be known as the “City of Fountain’s Rules and Regulations Governing Electric Service.”  (These rules may be referred to herein as the “Rules” or the “Rules and Regulations”.  Specific Rules will be referred to as the “rule governing….”). These Rules and Regulations are issued pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Fountain City Council (the “City Council”) pursuant to Section 9.16 of the Home Rule Charter of the City of Fountain and the appropriate statutory and constitutional provisions of the State of Colorado. The following Rules and Regulations set forth the terms and conditions under which electric service is supplied and govern all classes of service and all territory served by the City of Fountain’s Electric Utility (“hereinafter referred to as the “City”). These Rules and Regulations are necessary to fulfill the City Council’s obligation and duty to regulate electric service provided by the City and to ensure that said electric service, and the rates and charges therefore, are adequate, efficient, just and reasonable.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.020 Scope.  These Rules and Regulations are a part of all oral or written contracts for delivery of electric power and energy by the City.  By applying for or accepting electric service from the City, each customer agrees to pay the appropriate rate as set forth in the City’s rate schedules and to comply with the Rules and Regulations of the City regarding such service.  The City may discontinue or refuse service to any customer who violates any Rule set forth herein or who fails to comply with any requirement of the City pursuant to these Rules.  Copies of these Rules and Regulations shall be available for inspection during regular business hours in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.030 Waiver.  Failure of the City to enforce or insist upon strict compliance with any of the Rules and Regulations herein shall not constitute a general waiver or relinquishment of any Rules and Regulation stated, but the same shall be and remain at all times in full force and effect.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.040 Revisions.  These Rules and Regulations may be revised, amended or otherwise changed at any time by action of the City Council, subject to applicable charter, statutory and constitutional provisions. These Rules and Regulations cancel and supercede all previous Rules and Regulations. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.050 Choice of Rates.  Rate schedules for the City are on file in the office of the City Clerk and are available for review by an applicant for service. Service will be supplied under the rate schedule(s) selected by applicant subject to the applicability requirements and the terms and conditions of the individual rate schedule. The determination whether the applicant meets the applicability requirements and terms and conditions of a particular rate schedule shall be made by the City, in its sole discretion. When there are two or more rate schedules applicable to the service requested, the City will, upon request of applicant, explain the conditions, character of installation or use of service governing the several rate schedules and assist in the selection of the rate schedule most suitable for the applicant’s requirements.  Applicant, however, shall be responsible for the final selection of the rate schedule, and the City assumes no liability therefore. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.060 Conflict.  In the case of conflict between any provisions of a particular rate schedule and these Rules and Regulations, the provisions of the particular rate schedule shall govern. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.070 Liability and Indemnification. 
A. All lines, wires, apparatus, instruments, meters, transformers, and material supplied by the City at its expense or under its standard policies shall not be worked upon or interfered with by any customer or other unauthorized person(s).  The customer shall be responsible for any damage to or loss of the City’s property by the customer or others.  The cost of making good such loss and/or repairing such damage shall be paid by the customer. 
B. The customer shall be held responsible for injury to the City’s employees if caused by the customer’s acts, omissions or negligence.  The customer shall be responsible and will indemnify and hold the City harmless for any injury to person or damage to property occasioned or caused by the acts, omissions or negligence of the customer or any of his agents, employees, or licensees, in installing, maintaining, operating, or using any of the customer’s lines, wires, equipment, machinery, or apparatus, and for injury and damage caused by defects in the same. 
C. The City shall not be held liable for injury to persons or damage to property caused by its lines or equipment when contacted or interfered with through digging or the installation of objects in the ground or by ladders, pipes, guywires, ropes, aerial wires, attachments, trees, structures, airplanes or other objects not the property of the City which cross over, through, or in close proximity to the City’s lines and equipment.  The City should be given adequate written notice before any digging takes place near the City’s lines or equipment, before trees overhanging or in close proximity to the City’s lines or equipment are trimmed or removed or when stacks, guys, radio or television aerials, wires, ropes, drain pipes, structures, or other objects are installed or removed near the City’s lines or equipment, but the City assumes no liability whatsoever because of such notice.

F. The developer, or builder where appropriate, will be deemed to be the “customer” for the purpose of this Rule until all normal construction responsibilities in the development and on the site are complete.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
II. SERVICE CONDITIONS 
13.16.080 Customer’s Installation.
 A. The customer, before purchasing or beginning construction of a proposed installation, should confer with the City to determine if the type of service, capacity, and voltage desired by customer is available; to determine if extensions of, or additions to, the City’s facilities will be required; and to secure definite location of the point of delivery.  Before any additions to or alternations of existing installations are made by customer which will materially affect the amount of service required, or which may require a change in the type of service or the point of delivery, the City must be notified reasonably in advance thereof as to the proposed additions or alterations in order that the City may first determine if the service desired is available and, if so, that the necessary changes in the City’s facilities may be arranged for and completed. 
B. All wiring and other electrical equipment on the customer’s side of the point of delivery will be furnished, installed and maintained at all times by the customer in conformity with good electrical practice and with the requirements of the National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Safety Code, the wiring regulations of the public body having jurisdiction, and in accordance with the City’s Rules and Regulations.  The City may also require the customer to meet additional safety conditions when deemed necessary by the City due to the customer’s proposed use or installation.  It shall be the customer’s responsibility to provide suitable protective equipment to adequately protect the customer’s wiring and equipment. 
C. The customer’s service shall be required to meet the service conditions set forth in these Rules. Failure to meet these conditions shall constitute cause for refusal to serve or discontinuance of service, whichever is appropriate.  Any waiver by the City of any service condition contained herein must be in writing.  The City retains the sole discretion to determine compliance with these service conditions.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.090 Interference with Quality of Service.  The customer shall use care in the selection of equipment and the use of power and energy provided by the City such that objectionable voltage fluctuations or other electrical system disturbances, as determined by the City, are minimized.  If, in the City’s opinion, service to a customer, including his equipment or operations: a) causes objectionable voltage fluctuations or other electrical system disturbances; b) could cause the City to make system improvements that would not otherwise be necessary; c) interferes with telephone, television or other communication facilities; or d) in any other way creates interference with the quality of service supplied to other customers, including those situations where the customer fails to comply with these Rules, the City may require the customer to provide, at its sole expense, such special or additional equipment as is required to correct the situation, or the City, at its option, may provide such equipment if the customer agrees to pay the net installed cost of such equipment.  Should the problem prove uncorrectable, the City may refuse or discontinue service under such conditions.  If, within 10 days of notification by the City that corrective action is necessary, customer refuses to provide his own corrective equipment, or to reimburse the City for the cost of such additional or special equipment as is required, the City may refuse or discontinue service to the customer.  The City, in its sole judgment may extend the time for compliance with this rule when deemed necessary. In emergency situations, as determined by the City, the City may undertake corrective action or discontinue service immediately after discovery of the condition.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.100 Phase Balancing.  Where three-wire single-phase, or three-phase, or four-wire combination single-phase and three-phase service is supplied, the load must be balanced as nearly as practicable between the two sides or several phases, respectively.  In no case is the load on one side of a three-wire single-phase service to be greater than twice that on the other, nor the load on any one phase of a three-phase star service greater than twice that on any other phase. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.110 Welders. 
A. The City will serve, at the applicable rate and without additional compensation, welding equipment of the limited input type which conforms to the standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and which has a maximum input (primary) current rating not exceeding 12 amperes at 120 volts or 50 amperes at 208 or 240 volts. 
B. Welding equipment which does not meet the standards of NEMA, or which exceeds in input rating 12 amperes at 120 volts or 50 amperes at 208 or 240 volts, will also be served at the applicable rate, at the discretion of the City, provided that service to such welders has no detrimental effect on service to neighboring customers.  Such equipment may require an upgrade in service to the customer.  All costs of said upgrade will be paid by the customer.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.120 Motor Protective Devices.  All motor installations shall have protective apparatus or construction within the motor to accomplish equivalent protection as follows: 
A. Motors that cannot be safely subjected to full-rated voltage at starting shall be provided with a device to insure that on failure of voltage, such motors will be disconnected from the line. 
B. Suitable overload and overcurrent running protection shall be provided for each motor so as to disconnect the motor from the line to protect it from damage caused by overheating. 
C. Phase reversal and open-phase protection is recommended on all three-phase installations and is required for such installations involving elevators, hoists, and similar equipment to disconnect motors from the line in the event of phase reversal or opening of one phase. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.130 Instantaneous Demand.  In order to protect service and equipment, motors of ten (10) horsepower or larger shall have such characteristics, or be equipped with a starter of such design, that the instantaneous starting current requirement will be limited to approximately 300% of normal full load current.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
 13.16.140 Harmonics.  In the event that the City determines, in its sole discretion, that a customer’s loads generate sufficient harmonics to be detrimental to City equipment (such as transformers) or to adversely affect other customer’s loads, the City may require customer to take corrective action at the customer’s expense.  As an alternative, the City may choose to take corrective action itself and charge the customer for the expense of the corrective work.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.150 Power Factor. 
A. All non-residential customers with a maximum monthly demand in excess of 50kw shall be required to maintain a 95% power factor at the customer’s peak. 
B. All 5 horsepower or larger motors shall be required to install capacitors connected to the motor starter to be energized when the motor is running. 
C. In the event that it is not practicable for the customer to correct the power factor as required by this rule, the City may install corrective equipment on the City’s system at the customer’s expense.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
III. BILLING PROCESS 
13.16.160 Application for Service.  Each prospective customer requesting electric service shall sign the City’s standard application for service, agreeing to the conditions set forth therein, and shall supply the City with such information as is requested by the City, including, but not limited to, the applicant’s social security number, name and phone number of employer, birth date, the number of rooms of any residential dwelling requiring service, along with information relating to load, voltage, phase, the manner in which power will be utilized and, if necessary, credit references.  The City may inspect the customer’s facilities and investigate the information supplied by the customer to assure that any information provided is accurate.  Non­residential customers may be required to sign a special contract containing such provisions and conditions as may be necessary or desirable to protect the interests of both the City and the customer.  In the case of such a special contract, the City may modify either the City’s or the customer’s obligations, or both, under these Rules, by the use of express language to that effect in the written contract. No promise, agreement or representation of any employee or agent of the City shall be binding on the City unless the same shall have been incorporated in the written contract or application for service.  The benefits and obligations of any agreement for service may not be assigned without the written consent of the City.  In the case where two or more parties apply jointly for service, such parties shall be jointly and severally liable thereunder, but only one bill for electric service will be rendered.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.170 Billing. 
A. Bills for service will be rendered monthly.  The term “month” for billing purposes means the period between any two consecutive regular readings by the City of meters at the customer’s premises, such readings to be taken as nearly as practicable every thirty (30) days. 
However, the City reserves the right to require more frequent payment of bills.  The City will allow at least ten (10) days between the date of mailing or delivery of a bill and the due date of a regular monthly bill.  All other bills, including final bills, special bills, and bills for connection or reconnection are due within ten (10) days of the date of mailing or delivery.  Failure to receive a bill will not release the customer from obligation for payment.  The City will issue a duplicate bill upon request. In the event a billing error occurs, the City shall refund any overcharge and shall have the right to collect the amount of any undercharge. 
B. If service is connected not more than seven (7) days before the route reading date, a separate bill for this period will not be rendered but the readings will be included with the readings of the next regular billing. 
C. Whenever the City is unable, for any reason, to read the customer’s meter, the City may render an estimated bill for the month, based on the best available information. 
D. Once notification of termination or transfer of service is received and service is discontinued, the final bill will be computed and mailed within thirty (30) days of the last meter reading. 
E. Charges for all services provided by the City to a particular customer, including, where applicable, electric (including street or yard lighting), water, and sewer, may be set forth on one combined bill. Once an amount is past due, future bills will not reflect a breakdown of such a past due amount between each respective service.  Any payment by a customer receiving a combined bill will be presumed to apply proportionately between the amounts due for the applicable services provided by the City.  This presumption will be conclusive unless a customer indicates in writing when making payment that such payment is limited to specific services. 
F. The City will normally make all connections, reconnections and disconnections on weekdays (excluding City recognized holidays) between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. Where facilities are in place to serve the customer, the City will connect the customer’s service within three (3) days of a request for service.  Should the customer desire connection, reconnection or disconnection after hours, the customer will be required to pay the applicable after hours charge. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.180 General Deposit Provisions. 
A. The City will require a deposit from any customer or prospective customer or for any new account of an existing customer to guarantee payment of bills by the customer except when the Utility Director or the Utility Director’s representative determines based upon credit information or based upon previous utility service that a deposit is not required. 
B. The City may require a new deposit or an additional deposit up to the amount set forth in Section 13.16.180 F from any customer where the customer has recent or substantial payment delinquencies. 
C. Where a deposit is required, the customer may satisfy the requirement by cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a surety bond. 
D. The City will pay the customer accrued simple interest on a cash deposit at the rate set by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for the period the City holds the cash deposit. 
E. 1. All deposits will be retained by the City for a minimum period of two (2) years, unless service is discontinued: 
2. 
After the initial two-year period, and if during the previous twelve (12) months, the customer did not receive a service termination notice, the City will, upon request of the customer, refund the deposit and any accrued interest (the “deposit amount”) to the customer or, upon the direction of the customer, apply the deposit amount to the customer’s account. 

3. 
If the service is discontinued prior to the deposit amount being returned to the customer or applied to the customer’s account, the deposit amount will be applied to the customer’s final bill.  Any deposit amount in excess of the outstanding balance will be refunded to the customer, unless the customer has an outstanding balance for service to another address in which case the City may apply the credit balance to the outstanding balance at the other address. If the refundable amount is in excess of $5.00, a check will be mailed to the customer’s last known address. If the refundable amount is $5.00 or less, the amount must be claimed in cash in person. To the extent outstanding balance due is in excess of the deposit amount, the customer shall be billed for the remaining amount due.  In the event the customer fails to pay the final bill, the acceptance and application of the deposit amount to amounts past due does not constitute a settlement or satisfaction of the customer’s debt or limits the City’s right to pursue any and all legal remedies to obtain any balance due. 


F. 	For all customers where a deposit is required the following deposits shall be required: 
1. 	
For residential service to one bedroom dwellings with electric space heating - $300; 

2. 	
For residential service to dwelling with two or more bedrooms and electric space heating - $500; 

3. 	
For all other residential service - $100; 

4. 	
For all non-residential service-an amount equal to an estimated ninety days’ bills of such customer or $100, whichever is greater. 


G. 1. In the event any customer files a bankruptcy petition, the City will charge a usage deposit for electric service as set forth in Section 13.16.180 F or will charge a usage deposit for water service as set forth in Section 13.04.320 pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code, Title 11 U.S.C. Section 366, as security for services provided to the customer after date the customer files a bankruptcy petition unless waived by the Utility Director or the Utility Director’s representative for good cause.  The deposit is due and payable within twenty (20) days of the City’s receipt of notice of filing the bankruptcy petition unless extended by the Utility Director or the Utility Director’s representative for good cause.  The City will return the deposit as described in this Section consistent with the bankruptcy code.  Unless excused by the bankruptcy court, failure to pay a deposit in the time specified may result in disconnection of service until the City receives the deposit. 
2. 	
Unpaid charges for services rendered before the filing of a bankruptcy petition are pre-petition charges. Charges for services rendered after the customer files a bankruptcy petition are post-petition charges if authorized by the bankruptcy trustee, if any, or the debtor.  Pre-petition charges are the responsibility of the bankruptcy debtor; post-petition charges are the responsibility of the party authorizing them. 

3. 	
The City may file a claim with the bankruptcy court for all services rendered to the bankruptcy debtor. (Ord. 1242 §1, 2004) 


13.16.182 Unclaimed Utility Deposit Provisions. 
A. Purpose, Application and Authority: 
The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for the administration and disposition of unclaimed utility deposits for electric and water services held by the City of Fountain through its Electric, Water and Wastewater Utility Enterprise.  This Section shall not apply to any utility deposits held for wastewater services.  The City as a home rule city under its City Charter and Article XX of the Colorado Constitution, under the authority to enact local law relating to unclaimed property in Sections 38-13-104(1) C.R.S. and Section 38-13-134 C.R.S., Sections of the Unclaimed Property Act, Article 13 of Title 38 C.R.S. and having determined that the provisions of Article 8.5 of Title 40 C.R.S. do not govern utility deposits of the City of Fountain Electric, Water, and Wastewater Utility Enterprise as a municipally owned electric utility adopts Section 13.16.182 to govern unclaimed utility deposits for electric and water services. 
B. 	Definitions: 
1.
 “Fountain Utilities” means the City	 of Fountain Electric, water and Wastewater Utility Enterprise. 

2. 	
“Owner” means a utility customer who has paid a utility deposit held by Fountain Utilities. 

3. 	
“Utility Deposit” means a deposit including any interest thereon made by a customer with Fountain Utilities to secure payment or any sum paid in advance for electric or water utility services to be furnished, less any lawful deductions. 

4. 	
“Utility Director” means the director of the Fountain Utilities or the director’s representative. 


C. Procedures for Disposition for Unclaimed Utility Deposits.  A utility deposit shall be an unclaimed utility deposit and is presumed abandoned if C 1, C 2, or C 3 are met: 
1.
 A refund of a utility deposit which has been issued by check by Fountain Utilities and mailed to the owner at the owner’s last known address for delivery of mail according to the records of Fountain Utilities if the mail is 

undeliverable by the United States Postal Service to the addressee and is returned to Fountain Utilities by the United States Post Office as undeliverable. 

2. 	
A check for a refund of a utility deposit not presented for payment within six 


(6) months after the date on the check, which shall be deemed void. 
3. 	
A utility deposit which remains unclaimed by the owner more than one year after termination of services for which the deposit was made. 

4. 	
All unclaimed utility deposits existing on the effective date of this Section and all utility deposits which subsequently become unclaimed utility deposits shall be used to fund the Fountain Utilities low-income energy assistance program as established by the City Council pursuant to Resolution 05-046 or as the resolution may subsequently be amended by City Council. 

5. 	
The Director is authorized to establish and administer procedures for the implementation of this Section.  (Ord. 1299 §1, 2005) 


13.16.190 Service Charges. 
A. It shall be the customer’s responsibility to pay each utility bill when due.  If said payment is made by a check which is subsequently returned by the bank dishonored, the City will charge the customer a dishonored check processing fee. 
B. Whenever a service call is necessary for collection purposes, or service has been disconnected for fraudulent use, noncompliance with the Rules and Regulations or nonpayment, the City will charge the customer the appropriate service charge. 
C. For the initial connection and for each subsequent reconnection of service, the City will charge the customer a connection or reconnection charge.  If said connection or reconnection is made after hours (weekends between 8:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M., City-recognized holidays or on weekends) at the customer’s request, the City will charge the customer an after hours connection or reconnection fee. 
D. The service charges contemplated herein shall be set forth by separate Ordinance as approved City Council. These charges are to offset the city’s costs for such service work and transactions and are in addition to all other customer charges for utility service, for customer deposits and for required charges under the City’s Service Extension rule.  (Ord. 906 §1, 1991) 
13.16.200 Dishonored Checks.  Any check received by the City in payment of a customer’s bill that is subsequently returned from the bank without being honored will constitute non-payment of the amount due.  Receipt of such a check in payment of an amount due pursuant to a pending notice of discontinuance justifies discontinuance of service without additional notice.  If service is restored by the City upon payment with such a check, the City may immediately discontinue service without additional notice when the City learns that the bank will not honor the check.  In the event the City receives two dishonored checks from any one customer in any one year, the City may issue notice to the customer and require future payments for the next twelve (12) months to be in cash or certified funds.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
IV. BUDGET BILLING AND DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE 
13.16.210 Budget Billing Plan. 
A. Customers served under a residential rate schedule, who are not subject to a pending notice of discontinuance of service, may elect to convert to a Budget Billing Plan, subject to the conditions set forth in this rule, by submitting a written request therefore at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the customer’s billing cycle.  If the customer receives a combined bill including charges for other services provided by the City, as described in the rule governing billing, the Budget Billing Plan must be applied to the combined bill and may not be applied to selected services provided by the City on an individual basis. 
B. Any customer electing the Budget Billing Plan shall pay a monthly amount equal to a minimum of one-tenth (1/10) of the total of the customer’s twelve (12) most recent months’ bills, adjusted to reflect any rate increases which may have become effective during said twelve-month period. A customer may not elect the Budget Billing Plan unless the customer has twelve (12) months billing history at the particular residence. 
C. The monthly payment amount determined in part B above shall be paid for the following eleven (11) successive months with the final or twelfth month’s payment being a settlement amount equal to the difference between the total payments made during the prior payment months and the actual billing for the twelve (12) month period.  The settlement amount, if a credit balance, will be credited against future bills of the customer.  If the settlement amount is a balance owed by the customer, it shall be due and payable on the due date indicated on the bill for the settlement month. 
D. The Budget Billing Plan will automatically continue from year to year unless terminated by either party. 
E. To be eligible to participate in the Budget Billing Plan, a customer may be required to execute a standard form “Agreement for Budget Billing Plan”, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of the Budget Billing Plan.  If a customer electing the Budget Billing Plan fails to pay the Budget Billing obligation in any month, normal collection procedures shall be applicable for the outstanding Budget Billing amount.  The customer shall be removed from the Budget Billing Plan and service may be discontinued pursuant to the City’s rules and regulations governing such discontinuance. 
F. The monthly Budget Billing amount may be adjusted, at the option of the City, for any increase or decrease in the City’s rates.  Said monthly Budget Billing amount may also be adjusted, at the option of the City, if the customer’s use of electricity increases or decreases substantially. 
G. If service is terminated for any reason to a customer on a Budget Billing Plan, the customer shall be removed from the Plan and the entire outstanding amount of the account shall be due and payable. 
H. The customer may elect to terminate the Budget Billing Plan at any time by notifying the City in writing and by paying in full the entire outstanding amount of the account.  If the customer has a credit balance, the City will apply the credit balance to future billings. 
I. If a customer is removed from the Budget Billing Plan for any reason, the customer shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan again for a minimum period of twelve (12) months. 
J. The customer’s bill under the Plan will indicate the actual kwh used in the current month being billed plus the amount that would be charged under the current rates for the amount of usage. However, the customer’s obligation will be to pay no less than the amount denominated “Budget Billing Amount”. 
K. A deposit may be required of a customer participating in a Budget Billing Plan, pursuant to the City’s rules and regulations governing deposits. 
L. The Budget Billing Plan will be adjusted each successive year by taking into consideration the following: 
1. 
Rate changes during the year; 

2. 
Credit or debit balances at adjustment times; 

3. 
A change in usage; and 

4. 
Contract agreements. 


The customer will be notified of the adjusted amount of the Budget Billing.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.220 Discontinuance of Service at Customer’s Request.  A customer wishing to discontinue service or terminate his responsibility for service should give at least three (3) working days’ notice to the City to that effect, unless otherwise specified in the rate schedule or contract applicable, in order to allow sufficient time for final meter reading and disconnection or transfer of service.  Where such notice is not received by the City, the customer will be liable for service until final reading of the meter.  Notice of discontinuance of service will not relieve the customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under any contract or rate schedule.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.230 Discontinuance of Service by the City. 
A. Applicability. The City shall not discontinue the service of any customer for violation of any of the City’s Rules and Regulations Governing Electric Service or for nonpayment of any sum due for or charge related to electric service, deposits or other charges, except in accordance with this rule. 
B. Requirement of Written Notice. 
1. 
Written notice of propose discontinuance of service must be mailed by first-class mail, or delivered at lease seven (7) days in advance of the proposed date, advising the customer in particular what rule has been violated for which service will be discontinued, and/or the amount past due and the date by which the same shall be paid in order to avoid 

discontinuance. For the purposes of this rule, “amount past due” shall refer to any sum due for or charge related to services provided by the City, deposits or other charges.  With regard to a combined bill, as described in the rule governing billing, one notice of discontinuance may be used for all services provided by the City. 

2. 
The notice of discontinuance shall be conspicuous in nature and contain easily understood language. The heading of a notice of discontinuance shall be in blocked capital letters. The heading shall contain, as a minimum, the following warning written in English: 


THIS IS A NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE OF ELECTRIC 
   UTILITY SERVICE AND CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
   INVOLVING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. 
3. 	At a minimum, said notice shall advise the customer: 
a. 	
Of the right to contact the City by telephone or in person to attempt to informally resolve any dispute. 

b. 	
Of the availability of a hearing date and time, or the opportunity to request a hearing, prior to discontinuance of service, during which the customer will have the opportunity to resolve with a designated representative of the City any dispute, with respect to the amount or date due, and/or with respect to violation of any rule. 

c. 	
That the customer may appeal the decision of the City’s designated representative to the City Manager by requesting a hearing in writing within five (5) days with the City Manager and by posting a deposit equal to the amount due, subject to refund if the dispute is resolved in the customer’s favor by the City Manager. 

d. 	
That the residential customer may avoid discontinuance of service by paying, on or before the expiration date of the notice, the current month’s bill in full, and entering into a reasonable installment payment plan with the utility to pay the past due balance in equal monthly installments, according to the provisions of this rule. 

e. 	
That, in the event a residential customer is unable to pay for the services regularly billed by the utility and medical certification is delivered to the utility indicating that discontinuance of service would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of a residential customer or a permanent resident of the residential customer’s household, that there will not be discontinuance of service for thirty 


(30) days from the date of the medical certification. 
4. 
Said notice may also list agencies, which may provide assistance in the payment of utility bills, and the City may also provide a list of such agencies upon request. Any such listing is solely to inform the customer and the City makes no representations with regard to such listings and the accuracy thereof. 

5. 
In the event the customer previously has executed a third-party notification form indicating a third party to whom notices of discontinuance are to be sent, written notice shall also be mailed by first class mail or delivered at least seven (7) days in advance of the proposed discontinuance date to said third party.  The City shall make available a third party notification form to each new residential customer and upon request, to any existing residential customer.  The customer, at his option, may mail or deliver to the City such third party notification form, which form shall be signed by both the customer (or his legal representative) and by the third party to be notified in the event of possible discontinuance of service. 

6. 
The prediscontinuance notice and hearing requirements set forth herein are not applicable in the following situations: 


a. 
When, in the sole discretion of the City and its agents, an immediate     discontinuance of service to the premises is imperative for reasons of safety. This would include a hazardous condition on the customer’s premises or, where the customer utilizes service in such a manner as to make it dangerous for occupants of the premises (including energy diversion in the appropriate situations), thus making an immediate discontinuance of the service imperative.  Notice of the discontinuance and reasons therefore will be provided when the service is discontinued, or as soon thereafter as practicable.  The affected customer will be entitled to a hearing after the discontinuance. 

b. 
when discontinuance is ordered by any properly constituted governmental authority due to alleged violations by the customer of the ordinances, statutes or regulations applicable to the service. The City, in its capacity as an electric utility, shall not be responsible for ascertaining such conditions. 

c. 
when service, having been discontinued in accordance with this rule, is restored by someone other than the utility. 


7. In situations involving permanent residents in multi-unit dwellings, or a cluster of dwellings, known by the City to exist, where utility service recorded on a single meter is used directly or indirectly by more than one dwelling unit, in order to discontinue service, the City shall do the following: 
a. 	
Issue notice as required in part B to the customer of record; 

b. 	
Deliver or mail a written notice to each individual dwelling unit within the multi-unit dwelling advising that a notice of discontinuance has been sent to the party responsible for the electric bills for the dwelling, the date upon which termination will become effective, and how the individual resident in the dwelling unit may contact the City for additional information concerning the proposed termination; and 

c. 	
To the extent possible, post a copy of said notice in at least one of the common areas of the multi-unit dwelling. 

C. 	
Service Shall Not Be Discontinued: 


1. 
for nonpayment of any sum due which has not appeared on a regular monthly bill. The due date on the bill must be specifically indicated on the bill and the due date shall be no earlier than ten (10) days subsequent to the mailing or delivery of the bill. 

2. 
for nonpayment of any sum not past due, nor shall any notice of intent to discontinue service be sent with respect to any amount not past due. 

3. 
for nonpayment of any sum due, on which payment arrangements have not otherwise been made, with respect to any other account presently or previously held or guaranteed by the customer or with respect to which the customer was the beneficiary of service (including service at another location), unless the amount has first been transferred to the account in which the notice may be given and displayed on the regular monthly bill. In such event, the amount so transferred shall be considered “due” on the regular due date of the bill on which it first appears as a transfer and shall be subject to notice as if it had been billed for the first time.  If these requirements are met, service may be discontinued for nonpayment of any transferred amount from any other account of the customer. 

4. 
for nonpayment of any amount due on any other account on which the customer is, or was, neither the customer of record nor the guarantor, unless the customer is or was a user obtaining service through subterfuge in any manner.  Obtaining service through subterfuge constitutes grounds for discontinuance of service. 

5. 
between 12:00 Noon on Friday and 9:00 A.M. the following Monday, or between 12:00 Noon on the day prior to and 8:00 A.M. on the day following any City-observed holiday. 

6. 
until the City has made a reasonable effort to give personal notice of the proposed discontinuance either in person or by telephone to the residential customer (or to a resident of the customer’s household eighteen (18) years of age or over). “Reasonable effort” shall constitute at a minimum either an attempt to make telephone contact or an attempt to make personal contact at the location of service to remind the customer of the pending discontinuance and the terms to avoid same at least twenty-four 


(24) hours prior to actual discontinuance. This requirement may be met by the hanging of a door hanger containing notice of the pending discontinuance. 
7. 
if a residential customer pays, on or before the expiration date of the notice, the current bill in full and enters into a reasonable installment plan with the City, to pay all past due amounts, as elsewhere provided in this rule. 

8. 
if the residential customer presents a medical certification in compliance with the appropriate provisions of this rule. 


D. Restoration of Service. 
1. 
Where service has been discontinued for non-payment, service will be restored within 24 hours (unless extenuating circumstances prevent restoration) after the customer pays in full all amounts past due, plus any deposit and/or collection, disconnection and reconnection fees as may be specifically required by the City’s rate schedules. 

2. 
Where a service has been discontinued for reasons other than non-payment, service will be restored within 24 hours (unless extenuating circumstances prevent restoration) after the customer pays any disconnection, reconnection and/or collection charges, plus any deposit, as may be specifically required in the event of discontinuance, and notifies the utility and the utility confirms that the cause for discontinuance, if other than nonpayment, has been cured. 


E. 	Installment Payment Plan Arrangements. 
1. Installment payment plan arrangements must be made if a residential customer fulfills one of the following conditions: 
a. 	
on or before the expiration date of the notice of discontinuance pays the current bill in full and enters into installment payment plan arrangements, as provided for herein, for past due amounts. 

b. 	
On or before the last day covered by medical certification or extension thereof, pays the current bill in full and enters into installment payment plan arrangements for the remaining amounts due. 


2. Installment payment plan arrangements must be made with respect to any and all of the following amounts as may be applicable at the time the request for arrangements is made.  The total amount for which an arrangement is made shall be referred to as the “arrangement amount”.  The “arrangement amount” shall include: 
a. 
the unpaid remainder of the amount shown on the notice. 

b. 
Any collection fees required by the City’s rate schedules. 


3. 
The terms of an installment payment plan arrangement will be explained and offered to each residential customer who contacts the City in response to a notice of discontinuance. The City may require the customer to sign an installment payment arrangement agreement as a condition to the offer of an installment payment arrangement. 

4. 
An installment payment plan arrangement shall consist of equal monthly installments over a period of time selected by the customer up to three (3) months.  The amount of the monthly installment payment shall be the arrangement amount divided by the number of months over which the payments are to be made. 


a. 	
The first monthly payment shall be due, together with the new bill, on the due date of the new bill. 

c. 	
The second and succeeding monthly installment payments shall be due, together with each new bill, on the due date of the new bill. 


5. 
If a residential customer fails to make a monthly installment payment when due, the City may issue a notice of discontinuance and take the same steps for discontinuance as outlined in this rule. 

6. 
Nothing in this rule shall be construed to prevent the City from offering any other installment payment plan arrangement terms to avoid discontinuance or terms for restoration of service, which offer is at least as favorable to the residential customer as the terms and conditions set forth in this rule or to which the customer agrees. 


F. Medical Certification Process. Service may not be discontinued, or if already discontinued, must be restored, during any period when discontinuance of service has been demonstrated by the residential customer to be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the residential customer or a permanent resident of the customer’s household pursuant to the requirements of this part F. 
1. 
This condition shall be demonstrated when a physician licensed by the State of Colorado, or a health practitioner licensed by the State of Colorado and acting under a physician’s authority, makes a certification thereof and said certification is received by the City in writing. 

2. 
In the event a medical certification is delivered to or received by the City, the nondiscontinuance of service shall be effective for thirty (30) days from the date the City receives said medical certification. 

3. 
A residential customer may invoke the provisions of this part F no more than once during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, said period to begin on the first date said medical certification is presented. 


G. Mail or Delivery. Whenever reference is made herein to a notice or other document being mailed or delivered, that phrase shall mean that the notice or the document is either deposited in the United States mails, or physically delivered to the address of the addressee, and does not necessarily include actual physical receipt by the addressee.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
V. METERS 
13.16.240 Point of Delivery. 
A. The point of delivery is that point or points on the customer’s premises (or other agreed point) where the City terminates its electrical service conductors, and the customer’s wires are connected to the City’s conductors.  All equipment on the load side shall belong to and be the responsibility of the customer, except meters and metering equipment and other equipment provided by the City, including instrument transformers. 
B. It shall be the responsibility of the customer, builder, developer or their electrical contractor, whichever is appropriate, to advise the City of the customer’s requirements in advance of installing the service entrance equipment, and to ascertain that the location is acceptable to the City. 
C. When it is necessary for the City to move or alter its distribution system, thereby necessitating a change in the location of the customer’s service outlets and the point of delivery, the City may designate a new point of delivery to which the customer, at its expense, shall bring its facilities. 
D. Service will be delivered to the customer for each premise at a point or points of delivery to be designated by the City.  If customer requests more than one point of delivery where the City can adequately provide service at a single point of delivery, such additional point or points of delivery may be provided by the City, in its discretion, at the expense of the customer.  Except where determination has been made by the City that there is an operational advantage to it in providing multiple points of delivery provided for the convenience of the customer will be billed at each point of delivery as a separate customer and will not be combined for billing purposes.  Multiple points of delivery must be in compliance with all applicable codes and governmental regulations.  For the mutual protection of the customer and the City, only authorized employees of the City are permitted to make and energize the connection between the City’s service wire and the customer’s service entrance conductors. 
E. If, for special reasons, the customer requires or elects to use voltages other than the standard secondary and primary voltages of the City’s established distribution system, the special transformers (with necessary spare or emergency units) will be installed, operated and maintained by and at the expense of the customer. 
G. The customer shall install an approved meter socket, furnished by the City, for the installation of the City’s metering equipment.  The customer will also furnish and maintain all facilities and space deemed necessary by the City for the City’s transformers and other equipment at the expense of the customer.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.250 Meter Locations. 
A. Meters shall be installed on the outside of buildings, or service structures, or in meter pedestals provided by the City; except that in the case of rural service, meters may be installed on a meter pole.  Exception to this practice must be approved by the City. 
B. Meters shall not be installed in places difficult to access, such as over open pits, moving machinery, hatchways, in the path of water from eaves or rain spouts, or subject to live steam or corrosive vapors.  It shall be the responsibility of the customer to maintain a clear space of at least 36 inches in front of the meter.  No hazardous plants, shrubs or other obstructions shall be placed within 30 inches of the meter glass side of pedestals.  Customers shall be given ten 
(10)
 days to remove any obstacles after written notice.  After the expiration of the ten (10) days, the City, in its discretion, may remove the obstacle at the owner’s expense or discontinue service. 

C. 
Meters shall be installed at a height of approximately five and one-half (5 ½) feet on center above the ground or platform (except in meter pedestals provided by the City).  In cases where unusual conditions exist, the City shall be consulted prior to installation. 

D. Where the meter is recessed in the wall of a building, a space of not less than twelve 

(12)
 inches on each side of the center line of the meter base shall be provided to permit access for City test equipment. 

E. 
New service entrance locations shall be approved by the City prior to installation. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 

13.16.260 Meter Reading. 

A. 
The City will attempt to read all meters on a monthly basis.  Although the City will attempt, as nearly as possible, to read meters on the same cycle date, some variation may occur. 

B. 
If for any reason, a meter reading cannot be obtained for any particular period, the billing may be based on an estimated energy use and demand.  It will be subject to later adjustment, if deemed necessary by the City. 

C. 
The City will not be obligated to reset demand meters in the event of system disturbances, inoperable load controllers, or other reasons beyond the City’s control.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 

13.16.270 Meter Tests. 

A. 
The City will, at its own expense, make tests and inspections, as required, on its meters to insure a high standard of accuracy.  The City may, in its discretion test a meter at any time.  The City will, at its own expense, make one meter test per year upon the customer’s request. A meter may be considered accurate if it tests within 2% plus or minus.  The City may adjust bills accordingly if a meter tests in excess of the 2% accuracy standard. 

B. 
Additionally, more frequent tests will also be made at the request of the customer.  In the event the meter is found to register within 2% plus or minus, the customer will be required to pay a test fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00).  If the meter is found to exceed the 2% limit plus or minus, the bill may be adjusted accordingly for the preceding six (6) month period or until the previous test, if tested less than six (6) months before, and no charge will be made for the testing. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 


13.16.280 Separate Meter for Each Class of Service.  When the customer receives service under more than one rate schedule, a separate meter must be installed for service under each rate schedule.  The customer will be billed under each rate schedule based on the measurement registered by the applicable meter.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.290 Additional Meters.  Should the customer desire the installation of additional meters other than those deemed necessary by the City to measure adequately the service taken by the customer, such additional meters shall be provided, installed and maintained by the customer at his own expense.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
VI. MISCELLANEOUS 
13.16.300 Additional Load.  In the event the customer desires to change his load materially, he shall notify the City sufficiently in advance so that the City may, if economically feasible, provide the facilities required.  In the event that the customer fails to notify the City, and as a result the City’s equipment is damaged, the customer shall be liable for the cost of such damage.  The City will not be responsible for providing adequate service in the event that it is not properly notified. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.310 Attachments to Utility Property.  No posters, banners, placards, radio or television aerials, or other objects will be attached to the poles or other utility property of the City. Any attachment to the City’s poles or other utility property must have the express prior written authorization of the City.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.320 Curtailment. In the event that a serious power shortage should develop, and should it become mandatory that the City place into effect a curtailment program, the City reserves the right to limit the use of electrical energy during such hours as may become necessary. In the case of emergency, the City shall have the right to grant a preference to the electric service, which, in the City’s opinion, is most essential to the public welfare. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.330 Customer Power Outage.  If a customer’s service fails, he shall endeavor to determine if he has blown fuses, tripped breakers, or, if his equipment is at fault before calling the City.  If a service person is sent out at the customer’s request and it is determined that the customer’s equipment is at fault, a charge may be made for the call.  The charge may include the actual cost of labor and transportation. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.340 Easements.  A contract for electric service, or receipt of service by the customer, will be construed as an agreement granting to the City an easement for electric line, wires, conduits, and other equipment of the City necessary to render service to the customer.  If requested by the City, before service is connected, the customer will execute a right-of-way agreement, granting to the City, at no expense therefore, satisfactory easements for a suitable location of the City’s wires, conduits, poles, transformers, metering equipment, and other appurtenances on or across lands owned or controlled by the customer, and will furnish space and shelter satisfactory to the City for all apparatus of the City located on the customer’s premises.  In the event that customer shall divide its premises by sale in such manner that one part shall be isolated from the point where the City’s electric lines are accessible, customer shall grant or reserve an easement for electric service over the part having access to electric liens for the benefit of the isolated part. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.350 Diversion of Electric Energy. 
A. Definitions. 
1. 
“By-passing” means the act of attaching, connecting, or in any manner affixing any wire, cord, socket, motor or other instrument, device or contrivance to the electric supply system or any part thereof in such a manner as to transmit, supply or use any electricity without passing through an authorized meter for measuring, registering or determining the amount of such electricity consumed. 

2. 
“Energy Diversion” means by-passing, tampering or unauthorized metering. 

3. 
“Tampering” means the act of tampering, altering, adjusting or in any manner interfering with or obstructing the action or operation of any meter provided for measuring, registering or determining the amount of electricity passing through such meter. 

4. 
“Unauthorized Metering” means the act of removing, moving, installing, connecting, reconnecting or disconnecting of any meter or metering device for electric service by a person other than an authorized employee of the City. 


B. Prohibited Activity.  Energy diversion is subterfuge and constitutes a safety hazard. As such, energy diversion is prohibited. Due to its hazardous nature, discovery by the City that energy diversion has occurred shall be grounds for immediate disconnection of service without prior notice to the customer or user at such premises, and service shall not be reconnected until any and all deficiencies in wiring, connections, meters and/or electric facilities at the premises have been repaired, corrected or otherwise altered to conform with City requirements.  In any case where energy diversion has occurred and immediate disconnection is effected, the City will give notice concurrent with the disconnection or as soon as practicable thereafter and provide an opportunity for hearing regarding possible resolution of the dispute. 
C. Estimated Bill.  In all cases where the City discovers that energy diversion has occurred, the City may bill the customer for estimated energy consumed but not properly registered. 
D. Additional Charges.  Where the City discovers that energy diversion has occurred, the City, in its discretion, may charge the customer for the costs of investigation and the costs resulting from the installation of protective devices by the City. 
E. Waiver.  The foregoing rule and payment by the customer of any charges thereunder in no way limits or waives the City’s rights to pursue any and all remedies provided or affects any action or prosecution, under applicable Colorado laws and ordinances of the City of Fountain, absent an express written agreement to the contrary. Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.360 Service Failures. 
A. The City will endeavor to provide a constant and uninterrupted supply of power and energy to its customers and to avoid service failures, but does not guarantee same.  The City shall not be liable for any loss or damages, including consequential damages, resulting from service failures caused by accidents, acts of God, action of the elements, public enemy, strikes and other work stoppages, wars, authority or orders of government, required maintenance work, equipment breakdown, the unavoidability, restriction or interruption of its power and energy supply, or any other causes or contingencies beyond its control. 
B. Service failures include, but are not limited to, phase reversals and/or single phasing of three-phase services, voltage transients, frequency deviations, wave shape deviation and service interruptions.  In addition to the causes listed above, service failures may result from generally accepted utility system design, construction or operating practices and procedures. 
C. The consumer shall provide at its expense any devices necessary for adequate protection of its equipment, processes, products or personnel against such service failures.  The City shall not be liable for any loss or damages caused by service failures resulting from utility system design, construction or operating practices and procedures unless both the City acted in a negligent manner and the loss or damage would have occurred despite the proper installation and operation of the appropriate protective devices by the consumer.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.370 Notice of Trouble.  In the event that service is interrupted or not satisfactory, or any hazardous condition is known to exist, it shall be the obligation of the customer to notify the City of such existing condition. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.380 Resale of Electric Energy.  Electric energy supplied by the City is for the exclusive use of the customer.  The customer may not, by submetering, determine a quantity of electric energy and resell said electric energy to any other person or persons on the customer’s premises or for use on any other premises.  A master meter customer may, however, check meter tenants, lessees, or other persons to whom ultimately the electricity is distributed for the purpose of reimbursing the master meter customer through an appropriate allocation procedure.  In that event, the City reserves the right to check said meters and evaluate the reimbursement procedure to protect against inequities and guarantee that the customer is not reselling the electric energy. The City reserves the right to refuse to furnish electric service to any customer where the purchase of such service is for the purpose of resale by the customer to others.  In the event electric energy is sold in conflict with this rule, the City shall have the right to discontinue service to said customer.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.390 Right of Access.  The customer will provide access to his premises at all reasonable times for authorized employees of the City for any proper purpose incidental to the supplying of electric service. This would include, but is not limited to, reading meters and testing, inspecting, repairing or replacing any equipment which is the property of the City.  If access to the property or any equipment is limited in any fashion, the customer shall take all steps, including the provision of keys where necessary, to provide access to the City. All easement areas shall be maintained for adequate access to City equipment.  The City shall have the right to remove any obstruction at the customer’s expense if the customer does not correct the access problem within 72 hours after notification of the problem.  In the case of an emergency, the City may correct the access problem without notice.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.400 Complaints. 
A. 
The City will investigate promptly all complaints by its customers.  The City will keep for at least two (2) years, a record of all written complaints including: 

1. 
the complaint itself; 

2. 
the date received; 

3. 
the date finally disposed; and 



4. 
the actual disposition of the complaint. Complaints may be either service or payment related. 


B. The following procedure governs complaints to the City: 
1. 
A customer may contact the City informally by telephone or in person to attempt to resolve any complaint.  The appropriate staff person will investigate the complaint and may take appropriate action 

2. 
As an alternative, or if the customer is not satisfied with the outcome of paragraph 1 above, the customer may request a formal hearing to provide an opportunity to resolve any complaint in person with a designated representative of the City. 

3. 
The customer may appeal the decision of the City’s designated representative to the City Manager by requesting a hearing in writing within five (5) days of the decision of the City’s designated representative. 

4. 
For customer complaints related to a pending notice of discontinuance, a request for a hearing, pursuant to paragraph 2 above, prior to expiration of the notice, will act to postpone the proposed discontinuance until five (5) days after the decision of the designated City representative.  During this five (5) day period, the customer may further postpone the proposed discontinuance pending an appeal pursuant to paragraph 3 above by posting a deposit with the City equal to the amount due, subject to refund if the dispute is resolved in the customer’s favor by the City Manager. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 


13.16.410 Computation of Time.  In computing any period of time required or allowed by these Rules, the day of the act, event, mailing or delivery from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.  The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a City-observed holiday, in which event the period runs to the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or City-observed holiday.  All references to a number of “days” herein, shall refer to calendar days and not working days, unless indicated otherwise. (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) 
13.16.420 Service Extensions. 
A. Applicability.  This rule is applicable to all extensions of electric distribution facilities by the City to the applicant’s point of delivery.  Title to all facilities by the City pursuant to this policy shall at all times vest in the City.  All facilities beyond the point of delivery, except equipment such as meters that are installed by the applicant at the applicant’s expense and will be subject to the standards and conditions contained in the City’s Rules and Regulations. 
B. General Provisions. 
1. When one or more applicants request electric service at locations not presently connected to the City’s electric distribution system or request an increase in electric service necessitating additional investment, the City shall evaluate the request as to the nature and the permanence of the service.  The City, in its sole discretion shall designate the service requested as “Permanent”, “Indeterminate”, or “Temporary” in character, in accordance with the following definitions. 
a. 	
Permanent Service.  Service to customers pursuant to the City’s residential or general service – small rate schedules when, in the opinion of the City, the use of service, both as to amount and permanency, can be reasonable assured. 

b. 	
Indeterminate Service. Service, which is of an indefinite or indeterminate nature, such as that required by, but not limited to: 

i. 	
real estate subdivisions and development of property for sale; 


ii. 	mines, quarries, sand pits, oil wells and other enterprises of more or less speculative characteristics; and 
iii. 	
all other service to which neither the permanent or temporary classifications are applicable. 

c. 	
Temporary Service.  Service to circuses, bazaars, fairs, concessions, and similar enterprises, construction sites, and other enterprises of a temporary nature, and to ventures of uncertain speculative character such as coal and metal mining, gas or oil production operations during the preliminary or development period where the permanency of service is questionable.  This classification would include any service where service is projected to be utilized less than eighteen (18) months. 


2. The City will estimate the investment required to provide the service requested. The investment estimate shall include the following costs: 
a. 	
all costs related to the construction or installation of facilities necessary t adequately provide the service requested by applicant, including the cost of all materials, labor, right-of-ways, trench and backfill, tree trimming, special transformers and enclosures, transformer investment, supports or construction, conductors, lightning arresters, and other protective equipment. 

b. 	
All incidental costs such as engineering fees, fees for legal counsel, and all other overhead costs incurred in conjunction with the extension; and 

c. 	
Costs of reinforcement, reconstruction or relocation of the existing distribution facilities necessitated by the applicant’s request for service, including temporary movement of facilities during construction. 


3. 
To the extent both primary and secondary distribution facilities are required, the City will separate the investment estimate into those costs attributable to each type of facility.  Primary distribution facilities shall be defined as three-phase 

facilities as 12.47kv or greater.  Secondary distribution facilities shall be defined as all other facilities required to provide the requested service. 

4. 
All costs attributable to secondary distribution facilities shall be allocated to the applicant. In the City’s discretion, some portion of the costs attributable to primary distribution facilities shall also be allocated to the applicant after considering such factors as the number of additional customers anticipated to connect with such primary distribution facilities in the subsequent five (5) year period, the percentage of the capacity of the facilities to be utilized by the applicant, the minimum facilities necessary to serve the applicant, the usefulness of the proposed facilities to existing customers and the City’s system, and any other appropriate factors. The City is in no way precluded from allocating the full costs of primary distribution facilities to the applicant under the appropriate circumstances.  The total costs allocated to the applicant shall be designated the “applicant’s allocation.” Where there is more than one (1) applicant, the total costs shall be apportioned between the applicants, as deemed appropriate by the City. Each applicant’s allocation shall be utilized to determine the appropriate construction payment to be required from the applicant, if any, pursuant to the provisions of this rule. 

5. 
Records of those costs attributable to primary distribution facilities that were not allocated to the original.  Applicant(s) shall be kept by the City for a minimum of five (5) years.  For a period of five 95) years from the date of the completion of the extension, the City will allocate a portion of these remaining costs to additional extensions that connect to such primary distribution facilities, to be included in the applicant’s allocations related to those extensions, based upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph B(4) above. 

6. 
The determination of facility type and routing will be made by the City in its sole discretion consistent with the characteristics of the territory in which service is to be rendered and the nature of the City’s existing facilities in the area.  The facilities provided will be constructed to conform to the City’s specifications. 

7. 
After receipt of any requested construction payment, as required below, and the execution of an agreement, where deemed necessary by the City, the City will proceed with reasonable promptness to construct the requested service extension facilities pursuant to the applicable provisions of this and any other rules and regulations governing electric service by the City. 

8. 
The City shall review each application for service and each proposed service extension and shall prevent new requests for service or requests for additional service from causing an unreasonable financial burden on the City or the general class of customers.  In this regard, the City, in specific instances, may waive or create additional requirements governing a particular service extension.  Where it is doubtful that the revenue to be presently derived from the proposed extension will allow the City to recover the fixed costs on its investment, the City may require the applicant to pay the City annually an amount to cover the costs of depreciation, taxes, operation and maintenance, and removal of such facilities. 

9. 
Extensions of service pursuant to this policy are also subject to all other applicable rules and regulations and any additional requirements imposed by the City. 

10. 
Charges for service extensions may be reduced or waived by the City Council upon a determination by the City Council that the reduction or waiver of such charges provides an economic benefit to the City or to the consumers of electric service provided by the City and serves a public purpose. The City Council shall be the sole judge concerning whether the waiver or reduction of charges for service extensions constitutes an economic benefit to the City or to the consumers of electric service and serves a public purpose. 


C. Application to Service Classifications. Once the City has designated the appropriate service classification (e.g., permanent, indeterminate, or temporary) applicable to the service requested by applicant, and determined an appropriate applicant’s allocation, the amount and treatment of the cash construction payment to be required from the applicant will be determined as set forth in the following paragraphs. 
1. 	Permanent service. 
a. 	
The City will install at its expense necessary electric distribution facilities equivalent in cost to the construction allowance applicable to the applicant’s or applicants’ class of service as set forth on the service extensions construction allowance schedule.  For extensions involving more than one permanent service applicant, each such applicant is entitled to the appropriate construction allowance. 

b. 	
This construction allowance will be equal to the average revenue per customer, excluding any fuel cost adjustment, for the particular class of service.  This allowance is subject to review and adjustment by the City on a periodic basis. 

c. 	
To the extent that the applicant’s allocation exceeds the sum of all applicable construction allowances, this amount will be paid as a construction payment in advance of any construction.  When the facilities are completed, the construction payment shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs.  Based on this adjustment, an additional payment may be required from the applicant or the City may refund a portion of the payment, whichever is appropriate, within sixty (60) days. The failure of the applicant to make any additional payment requested shall constitute grounds for refusal or discontinuance of service. The adjusted construction payment shall be non-refundable. 


2. 	Indeterminate Service. 
a. 	For indeterminate service involving real estate subdivisions and development of land for sale, the City shall estimate, in its sole discretion, the net number of permanent service customers that may reasonably be expected to apply for service from the facilities installed to serve the subdivision or development within five (5) years of the completion of said facilities.  The City shall give the applicant credit for this estimated number of customers, multiplied by the applicable construction allowance, against the applicant’s allocation. The applicant shall pay as a construction payment, the excess of the applicant’s allocation over the applicant’s credit for the estimated future number of customers.  Where the credit is equal to or exceeds the applicant’s allocation, the applicant’s service will be installed without any payment by the applicant.  However, the applicant will have no entitlement regarding any excess construction allowance credit. When the facilities are completed, the construction payment shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs. Based on this adjustment, an additional payment may be required from the applicant or the City may refund a portion of the payment, whichever is appropriate, within sixty (60) days.  The failure of the applicant to make any payment requested shall constitute grounds for refusal or discontinuance of service.  The adjusted construction payment shall be non-refundable. 
b. 	For all other types of indeterminate service, the applicant shall be required to pay the City the entire applicant’s allocation as a construction payment.  When the facilities are completed, the construction payment shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs.  Based on this adjustment, an additional payment may be required from the applicant or the City may refund a portion of the payment, whichever is appropriate, within sixty (60) days.  The failure of the applicant to make any payment requested shall constitute grounds for refusal or discontinuance of service. The adjusted construction payment shall be non-refundable. 
3. 	Temporary Service. 
a. 	
For temporary service, applicant(s) shall be required to pay the City as a construction payment an amount equal to the applicant’s allocation plus all estimated costs related to removing the facilities installed to serve the applicant.  When the facilities are completed, the construction payment shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs. Based on this adjustment, an additional payment may be required from the applicant or the City may refund a portion of the payment, whichever is appropriate, within sixty (60) days.  The failure of the applicant to make any payment requested shall constitute grounds for refusal or discontinuance of service.  After removal of the facilities, any net salvage value in excess of the costs of removal will be refunded to the customer.  The remaining construction payment shall be non-refundable. 

b. 	
If temporary service is continued for more than eighteen (18) months following the extension completion date, the nature of such continued service will be evaluated, and, if appropriate, reclassified as indeterminate service.  If so reclassified, all estimated removal costs may be refunded by the City.  At this time, salvage value and the remaining construction payment shall become non-refundable. 


4. Overhead to underground conversion.  Customer(s) desiring to have the City’s existing overhead facilities presently providing service installed underground or desiring to have existing overhead or underground facilities relocated may request the City to make such changes.  If the City determines that such conversion or relocation can reasonably be made, the City will make such conversion or relocation on the following basis:  the estimated remaining life value of the City’s existing facilities plus the costs of removing such facilities less salvage value shall be paid by the customer or customers as a non-refundable payment.  The new facilities to be installed will then be considered in all respects as a new service extension under the terms and conditions of this service extension rule.  (Ord. 682 §2, 1985) (Ord. 1233 §2, 2004) 
13.16.430 Cogeneration and Small Power Production. 
A. The FERC has promulgated regulations with regard to small power production and cogeneration (Part 292 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations (1984).  As required by Federal law, the City, as a nonregulated electric utility, will implement the requirements of the FERC regulations through this rule. 
B. This rule applies to all qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities (“qualifying facilities”), as defined in the FERC regulations, that are willing and able to enter an agreement with the City.  This rule represents general guidelines, since the nature, size and character of qualifying facilities may vary widely.  The City reserves the right to evaluate each qualifying facility on a case-by-case basis. 
C. The City shall purchase energy, or, if satisfactory conditions have been met, capacity and energy, from any qualifying facility who offers to sell energy or capacity and energy.  The standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100kw or less are set forth on the appropriate rate schedule of the City.  Rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity in excess of 100kw shall be established by contract on a case-by­case basis.

during a system emergency where continuing purchases would contribute to such emergency; 

3. 
when the operation of a qualifying facility is jeopardizing the integrity of the City’s system or interfering with the service to customers or other sources of generation and transmission on the City’s system; or 


5. 	when monitoring or inspection by the City or its agent of the qualifying facility reveals a condition hazardous, in the City’s opinion, to the City’s system or a lack of scheduled maintenance or maintenance records for equipment necessary to protect the City’s system. 
U.

16.10.010 Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Colorado has delegated in Section 31-23-301, Colorado Revised Statutes, the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.  Therefore, the City of Fountain does ordain as set out in this Section. (Ord. 1183, §1, 2002) 
16.10.020 Findings of Fact. 
A. The flood hazard areas of the Fountain are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which could adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B. These flood losses could be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.  Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.  (Ord. 1183, §1, 2002) 
16.10.030 Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A. To protect human life and health; 
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard; 
G. To insure that potential buyers are notified that the property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.  (Ord. 1183, §1, 2002) 
16.10.040 Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its purposes, this section includes methods and provisions for: 
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
F. Prohibiting any development in regulatory floodways if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. (Ord. 1183, §1, 2002)

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 
16.20.010 Short Title.  This Title shall be known and may be cited as the “Subdivision Regulations of the City of Fountain, Colorado.”  For purposes of this Title, “these regulations” shall mean the Subdivision Regulations.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.020 Purpose.  The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development.  The arrangement of land parcels for residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, utility and other public purposes will determine to a large degree the qualities of health, safety, convenience, environment and general welfare of the City. 
These regulations are designed, intended, and should be administered in a manner to: 
• 	
Implement the City’s Comprehensive Development Plan; specific area plans; resource, utility and other master plans; Planned Unit Development (PUD) ordinances; and other development policies and ordinances, as such may be amended from time to time. 

• 	
Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision; 

• 	
Protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City; 

• 	
Establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and re-subdivisions of land to further the orderly layout and use of land; 

• 	
Harmoniously relate the development of land to the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts; 

• 	
Provide for adequate, safe and efficient public utilities and improvements; and provide for other general community facilities and public places; 

• 	
Ensure adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation, and other public requirements and facilities; 

• 	
Preserve important natural features, vegetation and viewsheds; 

• 	
Protect the community from fire, flood and other dangers; 

• 	
Provide for proper design of stormwater drainage and streets; 

• 	
Ensure the cost of improvements, which primarily benefit the tract of land being developed, be borne by the subdivider of the tract; and 

• 	
Make certain that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient capacity to serve a proposed subdivision. 

• 
Coordinate timely agency review of subdivisions and associated improvements. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 


16.20.030 Preemption and Authority.  In adopting these regulations, the City invokes its powers as a home rule municipality and preempts and supersedes any statutory provisions regulating the subdivision of land within the boundaries of the City.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.040 Jurisdiction. 
A. Area Inside City Limits.  The territorial jurisdiction under this Title shall include all land located within the corporate limits of the City of Fountain, Colorado. 
B. Area Outside City Limits. All layouts of proposed subdivisions outside the City, but within the territorial limits, established under C.R.S. §31-23-212, as amended, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its recommendations relating to subdivision design, traffic circulation, and the City’s Comprehensive Development Plan. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.050 Effective Date.  The effective date of this ordinance shall be five days from the date of final publication subsequent to passage on second reading by Council in accordance with City Charter.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.060 Restrictions, Limitations, and Prohibitions. 
A. Plat Required.  Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity, or any authorized agent thereof, dividing or proposing to divide land so as to constitute a subdivision as defined herein shall be subject to the provisions of this Title; and a plat for the subdivision of such land shall be submitted to, and approved by, the City pursuant to the provisions of this Title. 
B. Unlawful to Transfer Land in Violation of this Title.  It shall be unlawful for the owner, or an agent of the owner, of any land to transfer, sell or agree to sell any unsubdivided land or lands by reference to, exhibition of, or by use of a plat of a subdivision before such plat has been approved by the City and recorded in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder unless the transaction is exempted under Section 16.20.080.  The description of such lot, tract, or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer, or other document used in the process of selling or transferring, shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties or other remedies provided in this Title.  Both the grantor and grantee named in an instrument of conveyance prohibited under this Title shall be subject to the penalties contained in Section 16.20.130; provided, however, that it shall be an affirmative defense that the grantee in such transaction either had no knowledge of the transaction, or did not authorize, consent or acquiesce to the recordation of the instrument of conveyance.  In a security instrument, the party granting the security interest in a transaction shall be subject to such enforcement and sanctions. 
C. Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy.  Building permits and certificates of occupancy shall only be issued in accordance with the requirements of Section 
16.20.070. 
D. Construction Exempt from Requirements of this Title.  Specific types of minor construction are exempt from compliance with this Title and shall not cause a property to be platted in accordance with this Title.  Minor construction is limited to:  interior remodel; or repair or modification of other structural elements exterior to, but attached as part of the structure, such as roofing, windows, doors, siding, porch, stoop and stairway; or accessory buildings smaller than 120 square feet in area; or new construction limited to decks and patio covers; or other construction determined to be minor by the Subdivision Administrator.  In addition, legal lots of record (i.e., parcels created on or before July 23, 1973) shall be exempt from the requirement to plat to obtain a building permit provided the proposed construction complies with the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance. 
E. Grading and Construction of Improvements. No subdivision grading operations or construction of improvements shall be undertaken until the final plat is recorded and construction plans for all improvements are stamped accepted by the City Engineer and a Subdivision Improvements Agreement (SIA) and required surety is in place, unless otherwise authorized and controlled by a development agreement approved by the Subdivision Administrator with adequate surety to cover all costs associated with:  site restoration and erosion, dust and stormwater control measures; and any proposed modifications to existing public infrastructure including the repair of such existing public infrastructure.  Surety shall be considered adequate if the surety is sufficient to cover one hundred and twenty (120) percent of the projected costs identified and is provided in a form approved by the City Attorney.  The subdivider shall not initiate grading or construction of improvements within the proposed or approved subdivision until:  (1) the City Engineer has stamped the construction plans accepted, all required permits and approvals have been obtained from outside agencies with jurisdiction over the project or any component thereof; the development agreement or SIA has been executed and recorded, the required surety has been posted; and the preliminary plat has been approved by the City and a final copy of the preliminary plat integrating all requested changes has been filed with the Subdivision Administrator by the subdivider, approved by the Subdivision administrator and signed by the Planning Commission Chairman; or (2) the City Engineer has stamped the construction plans accepted, all required permits and approvals have been obtained from outside agencies with jurisdiction over the project or any component thereof; the SIA has been executed and recorded, the required surety has been posted; and the final plat has been approved by the Subdivision Administrator and filed for recording in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder. 
Any work performed in advance of final plat approval and recording is completed at risk by the subdivider. The City is under no obligation to approve the final plat.  All actions undertaken by the subdivider shall be subject to the inspection, open trench and other provisions concerning public and private improvements in Section 16.23 of this Title.  In no case shall construction begin prior to preliminary plat approval. 
F. Conformance of Plat Required.  No concept plan, preliminary plat or final plat of a subdivision shall be recommended for approval by the Subdivision Administrator or Planning Commission, or approved by the Subdivision Administrator, Planning Commission, or Council unless it conforms to the provisions of this Title. 
G. Street Improvements and Maintenance.  The City shall withhold all public street improvements and maintenance from all rights-of-way which have not been accepted for maintenance by the City. 
H. Withdraw of Approval.  The City may suspend or withdraw any approval of a plat or may require certain corrective measures be taken following a determination that the information provided by the subdivider upon which such approval was based is substantially false or inaccurate or that new significant information has been brought to their attention. Suspension of approval may occur at any step in the platting process and shall be affected by resolution of the Council adopted at a public meeting.  A written notice from the Subdivision Administrator shall be served upon the subdivider, setting out a clear and concise statement of alleged facts and directing the subdivider to appear before the Council no less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the date of notification.  The Council shall determine at the public meeting the nature and extent of alleged false or inaccurate information, shall consider any new significant information that has been brought to their attention, and shall have the power, if the Council determines there is a violation of any of the provisions of this Title, to suspend or withdraw any approval of the plat.  If the plat was previously recorded, due notice that the plat has been withdrawn and the plat voided shall be recorded in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder by the Subdivision Administrator. 
I. No Changes or Erasures.  No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made on the final plat after the approval by the City, except as may be required as a condition of the approval or may be made in accordance with the plat vacation and amendment procedures established by these regulations.  The Subdivision Administrator may approve the correction of minor or typographic errors. 
J. Ad Valoerem Taxes Paid Prior to Approval.  No plat for subdivided land shall be approved unless all ad valorem taxes applicable to such subdivided land, for years prior to that year in which approval is granted, have been paid. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.070 Issuance of Building Permits/Cos Prior to Platting or Improvements. 
A. No Building Permits or Certificate of Occupancy Issued Until Improvements Installed. Until all improvements described as required by Section 16.20.070.B or as otherwise specifically required under any applicable development agreement or SIA are completed, the City shall not be obligated to authorize the issuance of any building permit for private improvements within the subdivision.  Until all improvements as required in Section 16.20.070.C or as otherwise specifically required under any applicable subdivision improvement agreement are completed and formally accepted for ownership and maintenance by the City, the City shall not be obligated to authorize the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for any habitable structure.

D. Platting Required before Issuance of Building Permit.  Except as otherwise provided by Section 16.20.060.D, no building permit shall be authorized for issuance for construction on land for which a plat conforming to the requirements of this Title has not been approved by the City and recorded in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder.  Such construction is considered a subdivision. 
E. Permit Issuance by City Employees or Contract Agencies.  All departments, officials and public employees of the City or those departments, officials and public employees under contract who are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits shall ensure their actions conform to the conditions of these regulations and shall issue no permit, certificate or license for any purposes in conflict with the provisions of these regulations, and any permit, certificate or license so issued shall be null and void. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.080 Divisions, Conveyances and Transactions Exempted.  The following conveyances and transactions are permitted notwithstanding the prohibitions of Section 
16.20.060: (1) divisions of land created by order of any court in this state, or by operation of law, or which could be created by any court in the State of Colorado pursuant to the law of eminent domain including divisions of property by testamentary or intestate provisions or judgments of foreclosure; (2) divisions of land created by a lien, mortgage, deed of trust or any other security instrument; (3) divisions of land created by a security or unit of interest in any investment trust regulated under the laws of the State of Colorado or any other interest in an investment entity; (4) divisions of land which create cemetery lots; (5) divisions of land created by the granting, purchase, conveyance or separation of land for public purposes, including condemnation for any public purpose or the establishment of rights-of-way; (6) divisions of land that create easements or other conveyances of less than fee interest including an interest, or interests, in oil, gas, minerals, or water which are now or hereafter severed from the surface ownership or real property; (7) divisions of land created by the acquisitions of an interest in land in the name of a husband and wife, or other persons in joint tenancy, or as tenants in common; and any such interest shall be deemed as only one interest; (8) street vacations; and (9) divisions of land created for agricultural purposes into parcels of thirty-five (35) acres or more, does not require the opening of any new street or the use of any new public easement of access, does not obstruct, or is not likely to obstruct, natural drainage; does not adversely affect, or is not likely to adversely affect, the establishment of any freeway, major street, primary highway, or arterial street, and does not adversely affect the execution or development of any plat, any subdivision approved by the Council or otherwise adversely affect the orderly subdivision of contiguous property. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.090 Platting Waiver.  The Council may waive, by resolution, the requirement to plat for proposed divisions of less than thirty-five (35) acres subject to the following criteria: 
(1) no development permits (applications for zoning, subdivision or building) are being requested at this time; (2) the plat waiver request and accompanying legal description and drawing of the proposed division have been submitted to the City; (3) the division will not hinder the property’s ability to comply with an existing development agreement, PUD zone obligations, and other City plans and policies; or (4) there is a benefit to the public that results from the platting waiver. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.20.100 Relief from Subdivision Regulations. In conjunction with a request for preliminary plat or final plat, a subdivider may request relief from these regulations in accordance with the following procedures.  Only the Planning Commission and Council shall have the authority to grant relief from the requirements of these regulations.  As a result, if relief is first requested in association with a final plat, action concerning the final plat shall be held in abeyance until final action concerning the request for relief has been taken by the Planning Commission or Council. 
A. Request for Relief. The request for relief shall be submitted in writing to the Subdivision Administrator for consideration by the Planning Commission and Council.  The request for relief shall indicate the nature and extent of the requested relief supported with reasons for the request. The request for relief shall be heard concurrent with the preliminary plat request.  If the request for relief is submitted as part of a final plat application, no action on the final plat shall be taken by the Subdivision Administrator until the Planning Commission and Council have taken action on the request for relief. 
B. 	Consideration and Approval of Relief. 
(1) 	
Relief from a Public Infrastructure Standard. Where the relief requested involves public infrastructure, the Planning Commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the request for relief to Council. The Council shall take final action to approve, approve with conditions or deny the request for relief.  Approval of relief shall be based on finding that an unusual topographical or other exceptional condition not caused by action of the subdivider requires such relief, and that granting relief will not adversely affect the general public, nor have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.  In no case shall any relief be more than a minimum change in requirements; and in no case shall it be in conflict with the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance or objectives of the Comprehensive Development Plan.  In granting relief, the Planning Commission may recommend and the Council may require such conditions which, in its judgment, will substantially secure the objectives of the standards and requirements affected.  In granting a request for relief, the Planning Commission and Council shall find substantial conformance to the following applicable review criteria; 

(a) 
The relief will not be	 detrimental to the public good or to the surrounding properties. 

(b) 
There are unusual topographic, soil, access, location, shape, size, drainage, or physical features of the site. 

(c) 
The conditions upon which the relief request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable to other property in the area. 

(d) 
The strict application of the requirements of this Title will constitute substantial hardship or practical difficulties to the subdivider or the purposes of this Title may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal. Financial hardship, by itself, shall not considered grounds for granting relief. 

(e) 
The relief is consistent with the intent and the purpose of this Title. 

(2) 	
Relief from a Standard Not Related to Public Infrastructure.  Where the relief requested does not involve public infrastructure, the Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request for relief. Approval of relief shall be based on finding that an unusual topographical or other exceptional condition not caused by action of the subdivider requires such relief, and that granting relief will not adversely affect the general public, nor have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.

16.21.020 Description of the Subdivision Types. Processing of applications for the subdivision of land shall be based on whether the subdivision is classified as a minor subdivision, major subdivision, subdivision plat amendment or correction, subdivision vacation, or subdivision replat (includes a condominium, commercial building pad or townhome subdivision). A subdivision of land may be classified as more then one type of subdivision (e.g., subdivision plat vacation and major subdivision that replats the subject property).  Where a subdivision is classified as two or more subdivision types, the subdivision applications may be processed concurrently although each subdivision type may be required to be approved in a specific sequence (e.g., a subdivision plat vacation would need to be approved before a major subdivision that replats the subject property). 
A. Minor Subdivision.  A minor subdivision is any subdivision that: 
1. 	
Involves the division of a parcel into fewer than ten (10) lots or changes the configuration of fewer than ten (10) lots or tracts; and 

2. 	
Does not involve the dedication of additional public land or rights-of-way, except dedications required to expand or alter existing rights-of-way; and 

3. 	
Does not involve the vacation of previously dedicated rights-of-way; and

(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.21.030 General Description of Subdivision Process. 
A. Intent  The intent of the subdivision processes and procedures is to ensure that those actions involving a change in the configuration of lots, parcels, or tracts result in the creation of lots, parcels or tracts that:  (1) conform to the requirements of City codes, rules, regulations and ordinances; (2) are adequately served by utilities and other municipal services; 
(3)
 have safe and convenient access; and (4) are adequately described and surveyed for the purpose of sale. 

B. 
Overview of Process.  The review and approval process is designed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. Where the review and approval process involves more limited discretion, the review and approval process is handled administratively to reduce processing time.  The primary focus of the process is on the preliminary plat.  Generally, any decisions involving more discretionary judgment are made at the time of preliminary plat.  As a result of the focus on the preliminary plat process, final plats may be processed administratively if they are generally consistent with the preliminary plat and fulfill all conditions of approval associated with the preliminary plat approval.  There are six general stages of the subdivision review and approval process. Depending on the nature of the proposed subdivision, some or all will apply. 


1. Pre-Application and DRT Meeting. 
(a) 	
Pre-Application Meeting. Persons desiring to subdivide land are required to meet with the Subdivision Administrator for a pre-application meeting, unless specifically waived by the Subdivision Administrator.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations.  It may be appropriate for the subdivider to request a pre-application meeting in advance of each stage of the subdivision review and approval process involving the submittal of an application and associated documents. 

(b) 
DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator shall require the subdivider to attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision.  The subdivider 


may also specifically request to meet with the DRT.  The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed.  This step occurs early in the design process to provide direction, identify expectations, and establish clear lines of communication.  Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for concept plan, preliminary plat or final plat.  A DRT meeting may also be scheduled by the Subdivision Administrator or requested by the subdivider where significant issues have been identified or where agency comments conflict as a means of resolving the issues or conflicts. The subdivider may be invited to the DRT meeting scheduled to resolve issues or conflicts. 
2. 
Concept Plan.  A subdivider is encouraged to use the concept plan review process to test ideas and alternative development plans, to test variations in design not specifically provided for by this part or other rules and regulations, to identify any potential issues early in the process, or to simply gauge public and City acceptance of a proposed subdivision. The concept plan is an optional stage of any subdivision process, but is recommended in the case of large or complex subdivisions or as a tool in the annexation process. The concept plan is also used to review townhome and condominium subdivisions at the time of preliminary plat of the super lot, and should be filed concurrently with the preliminary plat applications where the development concept is known. 

3. 
Preliminary Plat.  The preliminary plat review process provides an opportunity for the subdivider to obtain approval of the lot layout and general design of the subdivision from the Planning Commission prior to completing detailed engineering. The preliminary plat process verifies the conformance of the proposed subdivision with City standards, codes, rules, regulations and ordinances and the City’s Comprehensive Plan. The process helps to identify issues that must be addressed to ensure conformance with all municipal requirements prior to final plat and recording, identifies needed improvements, and facilitates resolution of any complex issues associated with the proposal. 

4. 
Final Plat.  The final plat review process: (1) documents conformance of the proposed subdivision with all City standards, codes, rules, regulations and ordinances; (2) ensures the design of proposed infrastructure meets the requirements of the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications; (3)  determines conformance with any applicable preliminary plat; and (4) reviews the legal documentation associated with the subdivision to ensure that lots, tracts and parcels are adequately described for the purposes of sale, and assignment of ownership and maintenance of public and private infrastructure. 

5. 
Document Recording. The document recording process is the process by which the required subdivision documentation is compiled for filing the plat for recording in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder.  The materials are reviewed for 

conformance with the final plat approval, executed by City officials, and filed for recording by the Planning Department in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder. This step may occur before, concurrent with, or subsequent to the construction of improvements.  No lots may be sold until the plat is recorded.  A SIA with the required surety is required prior to filing the plat for recording where improvements have not been completed and approved by the City Engineer for preliminary acceptance by the City. Improvements may not be formally accepted by the City Engineer for maintenance by the City until the final plat is filed with the Subdivision Administrator for recording in accordance with Section 16.21.090 H. 

6. 
Construction and Acceptance of Public Improvements. The construction of improvements and acceptance of public improvements is the process by which all required services, roads and other facilities necessary to support the development of lots within the proposed subdivision are installed by the subdivider and accepted by the City. The process requires the review and acceptance of construction drawings by the City Engineer, inspections by the City Engineer, and acceptance of public improvements by the City Engineer. Construction may only be initiated where construction plans have been stamped approved by the City Engineer and all other requirements of Section 


16.020.060 E have been met.  In accordance with Section 16.020.060 E, a SIA or development agreement with the required surety is required prior to initiating construction of a subdivision or any improvements associated therewith unless otherwise authorized by the Subdivision Administrator.  Surety releases shall be made by the City Engineer based on percent of improvements complete at the request of the subdivider, but no more than three (3) surety releases shall be approved in any calendar year.  No improvements may be final accepted by the City until approvals of all facilities to be owned and operated by special districts or public utilities have been received by the City Engineer. 
C. Public Notice. 
1. 
Courtesy Notice to Adjacent Property Owners and Neighborhood for Major Subdivision. Notice is generally provided to all property owners within 400 feet of a proposed major subdivision at the time of concept plan (if any) and preliminary plat. The notice shall provide a description of the proposal including a copy of the concept plan or preliminary plat and time and date of the first scheduled Planning Commission meeting at which the application will be reviewed.  The notice is provided as a courtesy to property owners. No public hearing is held concerning a concept plan or preliminary plat. The subdivider is responsible for sending the notice by first class mail and providing a copy of the notice and mailing list to the Subdivision Administrator.  The notice shall be sent as soon as possible once the subdivider is informed of the meeting date by the Subdivision Administrator, but no fewer than seven (7) days before the meeting. 

2. 
Public Notice to Adjacent Property Owners and Neighborhood for Vacation of Right-of-Way or Public Improvements.  Notice is provided to all potentially-affected property owners of any subdivision action that will result in the vacation of right-of-way, 

public infrastructure or other public dedications.  The notice shall provide a description of the proposal including a map showing the location and extent of the vacation and time and date of the first scheduled Planning Commission meeting at which the vacation will be reviewed. A public hearing is held concerning vacation of right-of­way, public infrastructure or other public dedications by both the Planning Commission and Council. At the hearing, the Planning Commission and Council shall take input and comments from the public.  The subdivider is responsible for sending the notice by first class mail and providing a copy of the notice and mailing list to the Subdivision Administrator.  The notice shall be sent as soon as possible once the subdivider is informed of the meeting date by the Subdivision Administrator at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the public hearing before the Planning Commission.  Notice of the public hearing shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City at least 20 days prior to the hearing. 

3. 
Courtesy Notice to Adjacent Property Owners and Neighborhood for Other Subdivision Requests. Notice may be provided, at the discretion of the Subdivision Administrator to all property owners within 400 feet of a proposed subdivision at the time of concept plan (if any) preliminary plat or final plat for minor subdivisions, plat amendments, corrections, vacations, or other subdivision actions for which notice is not specifically required. The notice shall provide a description of the proposal and time and date of any scheduled meeting at which the subdivision application will be reviewed by the Planning Commission, if known, or a date by which the Subdivision Administrator anticipates taking action on the application. The notice is provided as a courtesy to property owners. No public hearing or meeting may be held concerning these other subdivision requests. If required by the Subdivision Administrator, the subdivider is responsible for sending the notice by first class mail and providing a copy of the notice and mailing list to the Subdivision Administrator.  The notice shall be sent as soon as possible once the subdivider is informed of the meeting date or date of proposed action by the Subdivision Administrator, but no fewer than seven (7) days before the meeting or date of proposed action. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 


16.21.040 Major Subdivision Process.  He major subdivision process is most commonly a five step process that includes:  (1) pre-application meeting and DRT meeting; (2) review and approval of a preliminary plat; (3) review and approval of a final plat, (4) document recording; and (5) construction of improvements and acceptance of public improvements.  At the discretion of the subdivider, the process may be expanded to include the review of a concept plan. 
A. Pre-Application Meeting. A pre-application meeting is required for all major subdivisions in advance of filing an application for concept plan or preliminary plat.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations.  The subdivider can request a pre-application meeting in advance of each step of the subdivision review and approval process. 
B. DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator may require the subdivider to attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision. The subdivider may also specifically request to meet with the DRT. The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed.  Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for concept plan, preliminary plat or final plat. 
C. Concept Plan Review-Optional Except for Super Lot. A concept plan, when associated with a major subdivision, is reviewed by the Planning Commission.  The concept plan provides the subdivider with an opportunity to present a proposed subdivision before making substantial investment in design to determine if the proposed subdivision is acceptable or if there are issues that need to be addressed in the design process in advance of submitting an application for preliminary plat.  The concept plan is also used to review townhome and condominium subdivisions at the time of preliminary plat of the super lot.  No formal action is required for a concept plan except in the case of a super lot where the concept plan becomes a component of the preliminary plat approval. 
D. Preliminary Plat Approval.  The preliminary plat for a major subdivision is reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission may approve or deny the preliminary plat with or without conditions.  The Planning Commission’s decision may be appealed to the Council by the subdivider or any aggrieved party. 
E. Final Plat Approval.  The final plat may be approved administratively by the Subdivision Administrator when the preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning Commission or Council.  The Subdivision Administrator’s decision concerning a final plat may be appealed to the Planning Commission, and subsequent to the Planning Commission’s decision to the Council by the subdivider or any aggrieved party.  The Subdivision Administrator has the option of referring the final plat to the Planning Commission for action when:  (1) issues cannot be resolved including those issues raised by a referral agency or other party noticed of the action; 
(2)
 where the final plat fails to substantially conform to the approved preliminary plat and any associated conditions; (3) where relief from a requirement of this Title or a deviation from the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications is required that was not approved as part of the preliminary plat; or (4) there are known complex or controversial issues associated with the proposed subdivision. 

F. 
Document Recording.  Upon approval of the final plat and all associated documents by the Subdivision Administrator, the final plat shall be filed for recording in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder.  All final plat materials shall be executed by the subdivider and submitted to the Subdivision Administrator including all recording fees, SIA and surety. Once all materials have been received and determined to be in conformance with the approved plat and these regulations, the Subdivision Administrator shall cause the subdivision plat and any associated materials to be executed by the required City officials and recorded.  The final plat shall be recorded prior to the transfer of title to any lot within the boundaries of the subdivision. 

G. 
Construction Improvements and Acceptance of Public Improvements.  The subdivider may initiate construction of the subdivision improvements only after the construction 


plans are stamped accepted by the City Engineer and the requirements of Section 16.020.060 E have been met.  The City Engineer shall not approve the construction plans until the preliminary plat has been approved.  After some or all of the required improvements have been completed, the City Engineer may approve the improvements, accept public improvements, release surety, and authorize issuance of building permits in accordance with Section 16.20.060, 16.20.070, and Section 16.23 of these regulations. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.21.050 Minor Subdivision Process.  The minor subdivision process is most commonly a three step process involving: (1) pre-application meeting, (2) review and approval of a final plat, and (3) document recording.  At the discretion of the subdivider, the process may be expanded to include Planning Commission review of a concept plan, preliminary plat or both. In some cases, the process may also include the construction of improvements and acceptance of public improvements. 
A. Pre-Application Meeting.  A pre-application meeting is required for all minor subdivisions in advance of filing an application for concept plan or preliminary or final plat depending on how the subdivider plans to initiate their application.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations.  The subdivider can request a pre-application meeting in advance of each step of the subdivision review and approval process. 
B. Concept Plan Review-Optional.  A concept plan, when associated with a minor subdivision, is reviewed by the Planning Commission.  The concept plan provides the subdivider with an opportunity to present a proposed subdivision before making substantial investment in design to determine if the proposed subdivision is acceptable or if there are issues that need to be addressed in the design process in advance of submitting an application for final plat.  The Planning Commission takes no formal action on a concept plan. 
C. Preliminary Plat Review. As with a concept plan, when an application for preliminary plat is submitted for a minor subdivision, it is reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission may approve or deny the preliminary plat with or without conditions. The Planning Commission’s decision may be appealed to the Council by the subdivider or any aggrieved party. 
D. Final Plat Approval. The final plat for a minor subdivision may be approved administratively by the Subdivision Administrator.  The Subdivision Administrator’s decision concerning a final plat for a minor subdivision may be appealed to the Planning Commission, and subsequent to the Planning Commission’s decision to the Council by the subdivider or any aggrieved party. The Subdivision Administrator has the option of referring a final plat to the Planning Commission for action when:  (1) issues cannot be resolved including those issues raised by a referral agency or other party noticed of the action; (2) where relief from a requirement of this Title or a deviation from the public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications is required; or (3) there are known complex or controversial issues associated with the proposed subdivision. 
E. Document Recording.  Upon approval of the final plat and all associated documents by the Subdivision Administrator, the final plat shall be filed for recording in the office of the El Paso County Clerks and Recorder.  All final plat materials shall be executed by the subdivider and submitted to the Subdivision Administrator including all recording fees, and any required SIA and surety.  Once all materials have been received and determined to be in conformance with the approved plat and these regulations, the Subdivision Administrator shall cause the subdivision plat and any associated materials to be executed by the required City officials and recorded.  The plat shall be recorded prior to the transfer of title to any lot within the boundaries of the subdivision. 
F. Construction Improvements and Acceptance of Public Improvements.  The subdivider may initiate construction of the subdivision improvements only after the construction plans are stamped accepted by the City Engineer and the requirements of Section 16.020.060 E have been met. The City Engineer shall not approve the construction plans until the preliminary plat has been approved. After some or all of the required improvements have been completed, the City Engineer may approve the improvements, accept public improvements, release surety, and authorize issuance of building permits in accordance with Section 16.20.060, 16.20.070, and Section 16.23 of these regulations. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.21.060 Vacation, Replat, Amendment, and Correction Process. The vacation, replat, amendment, and correction processes vary depending on the specific type of subdivision proposed. In most cases, when the action does not result in the vacation of public rights-of-way or infrastructure, or result in a change to or the creation of ten (10) or more lots (except in the case of a townhome plat or condominium map), the process is a two step process that involves: 91) the administrative review and approval of a final plat or other required documents by the Subdivision Administrator; and (2) document recording. Where public rights-of-way or infrastructure will be vacated or ten (10) or mote lots will be created, the process involves more steps depending on the specific action proposed. In all cases involving public right-of-way or infrastructure vacation, a preliminary or final plat or other required documents are subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission and Council.  Table 16.21.060-a details the process involved and decision-making body for the various plat vacation, replat, plat amendment, and plat correction processes. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008)

An approval with conditions is considered a denial for purposes of appeal 6A decision by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Council by the subdivider or any aggrieved party. An approval with conditions is considered a denial for purposes of appeal. 7 Where the removal of a lot line is desired for conformance with zoning only, a merger agreement may be executed by the owner and approved by the Subdivision Administrator as opposed to having to prepare the materials necessary for a lot line vacation. 8 A public hearing requires publication of the notice of public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City at least 10 days prior to the hearing.  

16.21.070 Concept Plan Procedures. The concept plan is an optional process, except in the case of a proposed condominium, commercial building pad or townhome subdivision where it is required to accompany the preliminary plat for the major or minor subdivision creating the super lot to receive feedback and recommendations from the City to assist the subdivider in preparing a preliminary or final plat meeting the requirements of applicable City codes, rules, regulations and ordinances, and advancing the goals of the Comprehensive Development Plan. The process is informal and the level of detail included in the application and associated submissions may be varied at the subdivider’s discretion depending on what the subdivider desires to explore or achieve through the process.  It is assumed that, as a minimum, the subdivider will include with the application, a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision that shows lot and road layout. 
A. Intent.  Prior to preparing a preliminary or final plat, a concept plan may be prepared for review by the Planning Commission.  The intent of a concept plan is to allow the subdivider to present a subdivision proposal at a very early stage to:  (1) examine the feasibility of the project, design characteristics, and relationship of a proposed subdivision to adjacent properties, (2) identify possible issues that may affect the proposed development, and (3) gain insight about the design from the public, City staff, Planning Commission, or Council.  This may include the location of geologic hazards, identification of environmentally sensitive areas and wildlife habitat areas, open space and parks, and general conformance with City codes, rules, regulations and ordinances, and Comprehensive Development Plan.  The concept plan process may be used in association with any type of subdivision application to obtain advice concerning the proposed development from the decision-making body before preparing and submitting an application for preliminary or final plat.  The concept plan may also be used to support other types of development applications such as a rezoning or annexation request.  The concept plan should not be confused with the Overall Development Plan (ODP) in the PUD process, although the required drawings, sketches, or maps used may be the same in both cases. 
B. Prerequisite. 
1. 	
Pre-Application Meeting.  Persons desiring to submit a concept plan are required to meet with the Subdivision Administrator for a pre-application meeting, unless specifically waived by the Subdivision Administrator.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations. 

2. 	
DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator may require the subdivider to attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision prior to filing an application. The subdivider may also specifically request to meet with the DRT. The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed. Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for concept plan. 


C. Approval Standards. No official action is taken on a concept plan.  The recommendations and discussion concerning a concept plan are advisory only and non-binding on either the subdivider or the City. 
D. Submittal and Review Process.  A complete application for a concept plan must be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator and shall not be considered accepted until all required information is received.

F. Expiration of Approval.  No formal action is taken to approve or deny the concept plan. The concept plan is advisory only and is not binding on the subdivider or City.  As a result, the concept plan has no expiration, but generally should be considered as reliable information on which to base a preliminary plat application for no more than one (1) year.  Where a concept plan is approved in association with the platting of a super lot, the concept plan shall be subject to the expiration provisions associated with the preliminary plat and shall be subject to no further expiration following the filing of the final plat of the super lot.   (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.21.080 Preliminary Plat Procedures. 
A. Intent.  The purpose of the preliminary plat step is to allow the City an opportunity to examine in detail all aspects of a proposed plat, including, but not limited to: compatibility with surrounding land uses and zoning; adequate water, utilities and other services; desirable open space areas; preservation of significant environmental features and viewsheds; protection from flooding and other geologic hazards; adequate land dedication for parks, schools and other public uses; and adequate streets and other types of access facilities for residents, businesses and emergency services.  The preliminary plat must comply with the applicable PUD or other zone district regulations and requirements.  The preliminary plat is also reviewed against design standards; the requirements of City codes, rules, regulations and ordinances; the City’s Comprehensive Development Plan, and other master plans 
B. Prerequisite.  The preliminary plat is an optional step except in the case of a major subdivision where a preliminary plat is required to be approved in advance of the final plat. Where a concept plan has been considered in advance of the preliminary plat, the preliminary plat should generally take into consideration the recommendations and discussions associated with the concept plan. 
1. 	
Pre-Application Meeting.  Persons desiring to submit a preliminary plat are required to meet with the Subdivision Administrator for a pre-application meeting, unless specifically waived by the Subdivision Administrator.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations.  Where a pre-application meeting was held in association with a concept plan, the Subdivision Administrator may waive the pre-application meeting. 

2. 	
DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator may require the subdivider to 


attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision in advance of filing an application. The subdivider may also specifically request to meet with the DRT.  The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed.  Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for preliminary plat. 
C. Approval Standards.  The Planning Commission will consider the comments of other agencies, governmental units, utilities, service companies before reaching a decision.  A preliminary plat may be approved provided:  (1) evidence has been presented that there is adequate water supply; (2) evidence has been presented that an adequate public sewage disposal system is available and, if other methods of sewage disposal are proposed that those systems comply with state and local laws and regulations; (3) soil and topographical conditions presenting hazards or requiring particular precautions have been identified by the subdivider and the proposed uses of the areas are compatible with such conditions; (4) proposed lots conform to City codes, rules, regulations, and ordinances governing size, length to depth ratio, width, frontage, access, etc.; (5) proposed park, trail and open space dedications meet the requirements of City code and are properly located and of the appropriate character to accommodate the proposed use (or cash-in-lieu of parkland dedication has been offered and is an appropriate and reasonable alternative to dedications); (6) adequate vehicular and pedestrian access has been made available; (7) necessary offsite improvements have been planned to accommodate the proposed development and provisions for their installation have been made; (8) the design of the subdivision appears to allow the design and installation of infrastructure meeting the requirements of municipal infrastructure standards; (9) no significant issues remain unresolved that would impact the ability to provide necessary services to the proposed subdivision or compromise the integrity of the proposed subdivision; and (10) that the proposed subdivision supports the City’s Comprehensive Development Plan and other master plans. 
D. Submittal and Review Process.  A complete application for preliminary plat must be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator and shall not be considered accepted until all required information is received. 
1. 	The subdivider shall submit a complete application with accompanying documents in accordance with the application package and Section 
16.21.080.E to the Subdivision Administrator including complete packets for each referral agency.  Referral packets with all submittal information accurately folded and assembled shall be provided by the subdivider in unsealed manila envelopes addressed to appropriate referral agencies. 
2. 	
Referral packets shall be mailed by the Subdivision Administrator.  The referral agencies shall provide comment within fifteen (15) days of receiving a complete submittal.  A minimum of fifteen (15) days after mailing the referral packets to the referral agencies, the Subdivision Administrator shall review and compile the referral comments received.  A DRT meeting may also be scheduled by the Subdivision Administrator or requested by the subdivider 

where significant issues have been identified or where agency comments conflict as a means of resolving the issues or conflicts.  The subdivider may be invited to the DRT meeting scheduled to resolve issues or conflicts.  The Subdivision Administrator shall prepare a staff report, schedule the application for review by the Planning Commission, and notify the subdivider of the meeting date and time.  The subdivider is encouraged to meet with referral agencies and other interested parties to address concerns with the preliminary plat prior to the Planning Commission meeting.  The subdivider shall provide courtesy notice in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 16.21.030.C.1. 

3. 	
The Planning Commission will review the preliminary plat, the referral comments, the subdivider’s testimony, the public comments, and the staff report. The Planning Commission’s decision concerning the application will be based on presented documentation and any remarks along with compliance of standards, policies, regulations, and guidelines and the preliminary plat approval standards outlined in Section 16.21.080.C.  Nothing in this Title is intended to limit the authority of the Planning Commission to impose use, height, area, or bulk requirements or restrictions governing buildings and premises within a subdivision, so long as such requirements and restrictions do not authorize violation of the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance, and the Council shall have the same authority. 

4. 	
If the Planning Commission denies the preliminary plat, the decision may be appealed to the Council in writing by the subdivider within fifteen (15) days of the Planning Commission’s action by the subdivider or any aggrieved party. The request for appeal shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator and shall explain the nature of the appeal including the specific issues under appeal and provide written justification supporting the appeal. The appeal shall be accompanied by all required fees.  After the request for appeal is determined to be complete, the Subdivision Administrator shall prepare a staff report and schedule the appeal for consideration before the Council. The Subdivision Administrator shall notify the subdivider of the date and time of the hearing.  The Council, after considering all information presented including the staff report, application, written appeal, the Planning Commission’s action and any testimony from the subdivider, Planning Commission members, staff, or public shall take action to either support the Planning Commission’s action, modify the Planning Commission’s action, overturn the Planning Commission’s action, or refer the application back to the Planning Commission for reconsideration.  Whenever a preliminary plat has been disapproved by the Council, the Planning Commission shall not reconsider the plat for a period of one (1) year from the Planning Commission’s final action or disapproval.  However, if the plat is modified so as to overcome the reasons for disapproval, the Planning Commission may consider the modified plat within the one (1) year time limitation.  If the Council approves the preliminary plat with or without conditions, a copy of 

the approved preliminary plat and conditions of approval shall be signed by the Mayor and placed on file in the Planning Department which shall serve as the official record of the decision. 

5. 	
If the Planning Commission approves the preliminary plat, no Council review and approval shall be necessary. A copy of the approved preliminary plat and conditions of approval shall be signed by the Planning Commission Chairman and placed on file in the Planning Department which shall serve as the official record of the decision.

H. Effective of Approval.  If a preliminary plat application is approved by the Planning Commission, the final plat may be administratively approved by the Subdivision Administrator. 
I. Post-Approval Requirements.  Prior to filing an application for final plat or initiating construction of the subdivision, the subdivider shall file a corrected preliminary plat meeting the requirements of Section 16.21.080.F and integrating all requested corrections, changes, and conditions of approval on its face. The corrected preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Subdivision Administrator.  If the corrected preliminary plat meets all the requirements of Section 16.21.080.F and integrates all requested corrections, changes, and conditions of approval, the Subdivision Administrator shall present the corrected preliminary plat to the Planning Commission Chairman for execution.  Once executed the preliminary plat shall be considered the official record copy.  Within ninety (90) days of the final action by the Planning Commission or Council to approve the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall file the corrected preliminary plat with the Subdivision Administrator.  The subdivider shall have thirty (30) days to make any corrections still determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator based on the Subdivision Administrator’s review of the corrected preliminary plat.  Failure of the subdivider to file the corrected preliminary plat within ninety (90) days of the final action by the Planning Commission or Council to approve the preliminary plat or to make the requested corrections to the corrected preliminary plat within thirty (30) days of receiving the requested corrections from the subdivision administrator shall invalidate the preliminary plat approval.  If the preliminary plat action is invalidated, an application for preliminary plat shall be made following the procedures as if the request were for a new application. 
J. 	Expiration of Approval. 
1. 	
Plat validity and Extensions.  The preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of approval.  Prior to the end of the one (1) year period, the subdivider shall have submitted an application for final plat.  The subdivider may request in writing, prior to the expiration of the approved preliminary plat, an extension of the approval period.  Extensions may be granted annually provided there has been no change in surrounding land uses or in the regulatory provisions governing development.  An application for extension shall: (1) show good cause for the extension; (2) be limited to a maximum of twelve [12] months; and (3) be reviewed by the staff and approved by the Subdivision Administrator. Upon denial of an extension, the subdivision Administrator’s decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission by the subdivider or any aggrieved party.  Upon denial by the Planning Commission of an extension, the subdivider or any aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the Planning Commission to the Council. 

2. 	
Expiration of Approval.  Prior to the end of one (1) year if an extension has not been granted or up to the end of any extension period that has been granted, the subdivider shall have met all requirements of the subdivision plat process and a final plat shall have been filed for review and approval by the Subdivision Administrator.  If a complete final plat application has not been filed with the Subdivision Administrator for all or a portion of the preliminary plat, the preliminary plat shall be considered to have expired.  If the preliminary plat expires, an application for preliminary plat shall be made following the procedures as if the request were for a new application.  No final plat shall be approved, where the preliminary plat has expired.  The Subdivision Administrator may close the subdivision file without notice to the subdivider. 

3. 	
Subdivision Phasing. 


a. 	
Partial Final Plats.  In the case of partial final plat submittal and      approval, the approval of the remaining portion of the preliminary     plat shall automatically result in an extension of one (1) year before     another final plat must be submitted. 

b.
 Subdivision Specific Phasing Plan.  Where a subdivision is phased,     a phasing plan for the subdivision may be approved as part of the     preliminary plat approval.  All final platting shall conform to the     phasing plan and provided the phasing plan is met, the preliminary      plat shall remain valid until all portions of the subdivision subject to the phasing plan are platted. The phasing plan shall include specific     dates or triggers for platting each phase.  In no case shall the      phasing plan allow any final plat to remain unrecorded at the end of      twenty (20) years of the date of approval of the preliminary plat.     The phasing plan may be amended upon application by the  subdivider. The amendment may be approved by the Subdivision     Administrator at the discretion of the Subdivision Administrator for good cause shown. If the subdivider fails to plat in accordance with      the phasing plan, the preliminary plat shall be considered to have  expired. If the preliminary plat expires, an application for     preliminary plat shall be made following the procedures as if the     request were for a new application.  No final plat shall be approved,     where the preliminary plat has expired.  The Subdivision      Administrator may close the subdivision file without notice to the subdivider. 


4. 	
Existing Preliminary Plats.  Where a preliminary plat was approved prior to the effective date of these regulations and no final plat application has been filed for review and approval by the Subdivision Administrator within one (1) year of the effective date of these regulations, the preliminary plat shall be considered to have expired. If the preliminary plat expires, an application for preliminary plat shall be made following the procedures as if the request were for a new application. No final plat shall be approved, where the preliminary plat has expired. The Subdivision Administrator may close the subdivision file without notice to the subdivider.  For any preliminary plat approved prior to April 1, 2008, the subdivider may request extensions in accordance with Section 16.21.080.J.1., provided the request for extension is filed prior to expiration of the preliminary plat. 

5. 	
Existing Official Development Plans (ODP). Where an ODP was approved prior to the effective date of these regulations and the ODP was determined to also constitute the preliminary plat, the preliminary plat approval shall expire at such time as the ODP expires if no final plat is filed in advance of the expiration. If the ODP has no expiration, the preliminary plat approval shall have no expiration. 


(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 16.21.090 Final Plat Procedures 
A. Intent.  The final plat establishes legally described lot lines and conveys necessary easements and land to the City and other public agencies.  The final plat is accompanied by a SIA. The final plat is required to substantially conform to all elements of the approved preliminary plat. 
B. Prerequisite.  After the subdivider has received approval of the preliminary plat, the final plat may be prepared. The final plat may reflect the entire preliminary plat or any logical part thereof. The final plat shall be in substantial compliance to all elements of the approved preliminary plat if a preliminary was approved by the Planning Commission. 
1. 	
Pre-Application Meeting.  Persons desiring to submit a final plat are       required to meet with the Subdivision Administrator for a pre-application      meeting, unless specifically waived by the Subdivision Administrator.  The      purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider or subdivision       procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be     included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary      recommendations.  Where a pre-application meeting was held in       association with a concept plan or preliminary plat, the Subdivision 

    Administrator may waive the pre-application meeting. 

2. 	
DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator may require the subdivider to attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision in advance of filing an application. The subdivider may also specifically request to meet with the DRT.  The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed. Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for final plat. 


C. Approval Standards.  The Subdivision Administrator will consider the comments of referral agencies and preliminary plat before reaching a decision.  A final plat may be approved provided all standards are met as described in Section 16.21.080.C and the design conforms to the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications.  The Subdivision Administrator has the option of referring the final plat to the Planning Commission for action when :  (1) issues cannot be resolved including those issues raised by a referral agency or other party noticed of the action; (2) where the final plat fails to substantially conform to the approved preliminary plat and any associated conditions; (3) where a waiver, relief or a deviation is required that was not approved as part of the preliminary plat, or (4) where the plat involves complex or controversial issues. 
D. Submittal and Review Process.  A complete application for final plat must be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator and shall not be considered accepted until all required information is received. 
1. 	The subdivider shall submit a complete application with accompanying       documents in accordance with the application package and Section

A minimum of fifteen (15) days after                        mailing the referral packets to the referral agencies, the Subdivision                         Administrator shall review and compile the referral comments received. A                        DRT meeting may also be scheduled by the Subdivision Administrator or                         requested by the subdivider during the review of a final plat where                         significant issues have been identified or where agency comments conflict                        as a means of resolving the issues or conflicts.  The subdivider may be                         invited to the DRT meeting scheduled to resolve issues or conflicts. 

3. 	
Based upon the issues identified in the review, the Subdivision                        Administrator may forward the final plat to the Planning Commission for action. In either event, the Subdivision Administrator shall prepare a                       checklist of needed corrections and present the corrections to the  subdivider. 

4. 	
In the event the final plat is forwarded to the Planning Commission for  review, the following steps shall be followed:

The replat involves the vacation of previously platted land with or without the requirement to file a vacation plat.  Several forms of replat are recognized these include Major Subdivisions, Minor Subdivisions, Townhome Subdivisions, Commercial Building Pads, and Condominium Subdivisions. Condominium subdivisions or maps are governed by Section 16.21.100.1. 

2. 	
Prerequisite. 


a. 	
Pre-Application Meeting. Persons desiring to submit a replat are required to meet with the Subdivision Administrator for a pre-application meeting, unless specifically waived by the Subdivision Administrator.  The purpose of the meeting is to inform the subdivider of subdivision procedures and requirements, to provide a checklist of the items to be included with the subdivision application, and to provide preliminary recommendations. Where a pre-application meeting was held in association with a concept plan or preliminary plat, the Subdivision Administrator may waive the pre­application meeting. 

b. 	
DRT Meeting.  Where determined necessary by the Subdivision Administrator, the Subdivision Administrator may require the subdivider to attend a DRT meeting to discuss the proposed subdivision in advance of filing an application. The subdivider may also specifically request to meet with the DRT.  The DRT meetings provide the subdivider with the opportunity to interface with all members of the review team and to identify issues that need to be addressed.  Where required by the Subdivision Administrator, attendance at the DRT meeting shall be considered a prerequisite to acceptance of any application for replat. 


3. 	
Approval Standards.  The approval standards for a replat are the same as those for a preliminary plat and final plat as specified in Section 16.21.080.C and 16.21.090.C. In addition, because a replat involves the vacation of all or a portion of a previously approved plat, the approval standards for a vacation plat also apply.  If the vacation involves existing public infrastructure or dedications that are in use, the approval standards also include the approval standards identified in Section 16.21.100.A.3.  If 

the vacation does not involve the vacation of public infrastructure or dedications that are in use, the approval standards include the approval standards identified in Section 16.21.100.B.3. 

4. 	
Submittal and Review Process.  A complete application for replat must be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator and shall not be considered accepted until all required information is received. 


a. 	Replats Processed as Minor Major Subdivisions.  The replat application shall be processed as a Minor or Major Subdivision in accordance with Section 
16.21.040 or 16.21.050 depending on the exact nature of the request. Notice shall be as required for the associated vacation and platting actions. 
b. 	Townhome or Commercial Building Pads.  Where a concept plan for a townhome or commercial development was prepared and approved as part of the super lot, the townhome or commercial building pad plat may be processed administratively as a final plat even though the plat may result in the creation of more than 10 lots.  Where no concept plan was approved when establishing the super lot, the townhome or commercial building pad plat shall be processed as a Minor or Major Subdivision in accordance with Section 16.21.040 or 16.21.050 depending on the exact nature of the request. Notice is as required for the platting action in the case of an administrative approval. 
5. 	General Submittal Requirements.  The submittal requirements shall be the same as those required for Preliminary and Final Plat in accordance with Section 
16.21.080.D
 or 16.21.090.D depending on the exact nature of the request.  Where an easement will be vacated or vacated and relocated, the applicant shall provide letters not objecting to the vacation or vacation and relocation from all easement beneficiaries.  If letters from easement beneficiaries cannot be obtained, a plat vacation application must be submitted and processed concurrently with the lot line vacation in accordance with Section 16.21.100.B  Where a right-of-way will be vacated, the right-of-way shall be vacated using the procedures established in Section 16.21.100.A or 16.21.100.G.

(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.21.110 Inactive Files.  Subdivision files become inactive when the subdivider is required to submit additional information, request a meeting date and has failed to do so, or no applicant activity and progress have occurred on the application for a period of more than six (6) months. When a subdivision file becomes inactive, the subdivision application shall become void. Submittal of a new subdivision application and fees shall be required to pursue the subdivision request. 
A written application for an extension must show good cause for the extension along with an 
estimated time for submittal of the additional information or submittal of a request for a hearing 
date. The Subdivision Administrator may grant an extension of time, for no more than six (6) 
months, upon timely submission of a written application by the subdivider providing a) land 
development in the surrounding area has not changed, b) regulatory provisions governing the 
development have not changed, and c) the Subdivision Administrator determines that the 
requested extension of time is for good cause.  In determining if good cause for an extension 
exists, the Subdivision Administrator shall consider if the applicant has demonstrated good cause 
for an extension request based upon sufficient financial hardship or other sufficient hardship. 

After granting an extension of time, the Subdivision Administrator may grant additional 
extensions of time of no more than six (6) months each if a written request in accordance with 
the criteria set forth in this section for extension is submitted prior to the expiration of the 
previous extension. 

Whenever an application for an extension of time is submitted prior to a subdivision file 
becoming inactive the file shall remain active and the subdivision application shall remain in 
effect until the Subdivision Administrator approves or disapproves the application for an 
extension of time.  Subdivision files may have several periods of inactivity throughout the 
subdivision process; provided that no period of subdivision file inactivity shall exceed six (6) 
months. In no case shall extensions of time be granted which together total more than twelve 
912) consecutive months. 

These provisions shall apply to all subdivision applications on file with the City and to any 
subdivision applications filed thereafter.

16.22 SUBDIVISON DESIGN STANDARDS 
16.22.020 General Requirements. 
A. Conformity with Zoning.  In addition to the standards set forth in this Title, all plats and maps shall comply with the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance. 
B. Continuation of Roads and Other Linear Facilities. Subdivisions shall be designed to accommodate the continuation of streets, trails, pedestrian access, utilities and drainage facilities into adjacent property unless there is sufficient justification for an alternative design.  The connection shall provide a logical, safe and convenient circulation link for vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian, or equestrian traffic with existing or planned circulation routes and, in particular, to destinations such as schools, parks and business or commercial centers. 
C. Steep, Unsuitable and Poorly Drained Lands. Steep land, unstable land, and             areas having inadequate drainage shall be noted, and unless acceptable provisions are made for eliminating or controlling problems that may endanger health, life, or property, such areas shall not be platted for occupancy. 
D. Natural Drainage Channels. Any land in a natural drainage channel shall not be platted for occupancy unless adequate provisions to eliminate or control flood hazards are made and approved. These provisions shall be made to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, as well as to eliminate any flood hazard resulting from the development of the area. Development shall be carried out in conformity with plans as finally approved. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.030 Block Standards. Block design shall conform to sound subdivision design principles; and the length, width and shape shall be determined with due regard to zoning district requirements as to lot size, topographic conditions, and the need for safe, convenient access and traffic circulation. Blocks shall not exceed fifteen hundred (1,500) feet in length.  Whenever practicable, blocks along major streets shall not be less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.040 Lot Standards. 
A. Size, Shape and Orientation. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate to the proposed subdivision location, and to the type of development contemplated, and shall conform to requirements of this Title and the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance.  All subdivisions shall result in the creation of lots that are developable and that have adequate building sites. 
B. Contours and Natural Features. The layout of lots and blocks should provide desirable settings for structures by making use of natural contours and maintaining existing views, affording privacy for the residents, and protection from adverse noise and vehicular traffic. Natural features and vegetation of the area should be preserved to the greatest extent possible. 
C. Steep or Unsuitable Slopes. Steep land or unsuitable slopes shall be avoided in accordance with Section 16.22.020.C.  Appropriate engineering measures to ensure slope stability, occupant safety and erosion prevention shall be required where lots are proposed in areas having slopes in excess of 10 percent. 
D. Division of Lots or Subdivision by Municipal or School District Boundaries. No subdivision or lot within a subdivision shall be divided by a City limit line or School District boundary. 
E. Access of Lots to Street.  Each lot shall be provided with vehicular access to a dedicated public street. Access to and from the lot may occur by shared private driveway easement or private street.  Residential lots should front only on Residential, Residential Collector, or Local streets including cul-de-sacs located on Residential, Residential Collector, or Local Streets (See Section 16.24.040 for street types).  Commercial and industrial lots should front only on Industrial/Commercial Collectors/Local Streets.  Lots designated to face Expressway, Community Arterial or Community Collector Streets shall provide adequate means for automobile turnaround within the lot.  Direct lot access is not generally allowed from a Community Arterial or Community Collector Street, but may be granted where no other alternative exists.  However, every effort shall be made in the design of a subdivision to minimize the number of accesses to a Community Arterial or Community Collector. No direct lot access is allowed from an Expressway.  No more than four (4) lots may access a public or private street via a private driveway easement except where specifically designed as part of a commercial or industrial development where adequate provision for access by emergency service vehicles has been provided and maintenance is secured through maintenance agreements approved by the City Attorney. 
F. Use of Double Fronting Lots Limited. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where they are needed to provide for the separation of residential development from major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages or topography or orientation. An appropriate landscaped or fenced buffer shall be provided along the portion of the lots abutting such a traffic artery or other use where screening is required.  There shall be no right of access across a planting and screening easement.  The City may require a permanent ornamental fence of a height and architectural design that will appropriately screen and be harmonious with the neighborhood and residential character. 
G. Use and Design of Flag Lots.  Flag lots shall only be allowed where warranted by physical conditions of land form, existing lot pattern, or unusual size or shape of parcel(s).  The narrow strip of land connecting the main portion of a flag lot to the street shall not be less than twenty (20) feet wide at any point so long as five-foot (5’) side lot utility public easements are provided on property adjacent to the flag lot lines.  If public easements are not provided on the adjacent lot, the stem portion of the flag lot shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width. The narrow strip of land shall also provide for practical vehicular and utility access.  The stem-portion of the lot may not be used to calculate the minimum lot area requirement of the zoning district. The length of the stem of the flag lot shall not exceed the length of the longest side of the flag portion of the flag lot.  Wherever possible, flag lots should be avoided in favor of creating lots without frontage on a private or public road where access is provided via a shared private driveway easement.  All driveways shall be consolidated to the maximum extent practicable. 
H. Superlots.  If a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots for purposes of future division or the creation of townhome or condominium plats, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision. 
I. Orientation of Side Lot Lines.  The side lines of all lots should be at right angles or radial to the street upon which the lots front with a maximum divergence of up to ten (10) degrees at the front setback line, unless there are topographic features or areas of unusual vegetation warranting greater divergence from this standard or the most efficient use of land demands an alternative standard. 
J. Zoning.  Lots and tracts shall be entirely within one (1) zone or use area. 
K. Floodplain.  Tracts of land or portions thereof lying within the floodplain shall not be subdivided except for undeveloped open space until the subdivider has complied with requirements of the City of Fountain floodplain ordinance and Section 16.22.020.D. 
L. Remnants of Land.  Substandard remnants of land shall be prohibited unless designated as tracts or adequate assurance is provided to incorporate the tracts into usable lots in future developments. 
M. Special Tracts.  Special tracts of land that are included on a plat must have a special plat note describing the intended use, ownership, and perpetual maintenance responsibility for the tract. 
N. Commercial Lots or Building Pads.  Commercial lots or building pads shall not be required to have frontage on a public street and may be platted as townhome or condominium subdivisions. Access may be provided by cross-lot access easements within a commercial development.  All lots and building pads shall have legal access and shall be designed to accommodate the proposed use. 
O. 	Lot Design Adjacent to Arterial and Collector Streets and Railroad. 
1. 	
Arterial and Collector Streets.  Restriction of access shall be required when a lot or tract adjoins a Community Arterial or Community Collector Street. Marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation, deep lots, or similar treatment shall be required to reduce the impact of traffic on residential properties and to avoid interference with the movement of traffic on thoroughfares.  At a minimum, all plats having lots bordering a Community Collector or Community Arterial Street shall contain a note limiting or prohibiting ingress and egress to that street. 

2. 	
Railroads. Where a residential subdivision borders a railroad right-of­way, either a parallel street, lots with increased setbacks, or a landscaped buffer area may be required by the Planning Commission and the Council. 


(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.050 Easements. 
A. Maintenance of Easements. The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all easements. 
B. Required Public Utility and Drainage Easements. Public utility and private drainage easements shall be provided not less than five (5) feet in width on both sides of all side lot lines and eight (8) feet in width on both sides of all rear lot lines.  If the rear lot line adjoins an unplatted parcel under separate ownership, the utility easement for the rear lot line shall be twelve (12) feet in width.  A public utility and improvement easement shall be provided not less than ten (10) feet in width along the front lot line.  The ten (10) foot easement is in addition to the five (5) foot easement required by Section 16.24.040.  Additional easements or tracts may be required to accommodate drainage from the subdivision and maintain drainage through the subdivision. In some cases, a special district or public utility may require additional easements or wider easements to accommodate utilities.  Where a special district or public utility requires additional or wider easements to serve a proposed subdivision, the special district or public utility standard shall prevail.  Where the special districts and utility companies serving a subdivision agree to an alternative easement layout, the Planning Commission or Subdivision Administrator may approve the alternative layout upon recommendation of the City Engineer at the time of the preliminary or final plat. 
C. Use of Easements by Lot Owner. No buildings or structures shall be placed within an easement unless specifically authorized by the City of Fountain.  Fences six (6) feet or less in height shall be allowed without City approval, but are subject to damage or removal by any entity authorized to use the easement.  Such damage or removal shall not be the responsibility of the entity authorized to use the easement, but shall be the responsibility of the lot owner. However, the entity authorized to use the easement shall be responsible for making a reasonable attempt to restore the fence and other features within the easement to their original condition. 
D. Site Distance Triangle Easements.  The appropriate traffic sight distance triangles easements shall be designated and dimensioned on the plat.  Sight distance triangles shall be shown at the intersection of all roads and at the intersection of all commercial or private road, drives, and access points with public roads with 500 ADT or more.  No buildings, structures, vegetation, or other items higher than three (3) feet in height shall be placed within a site distance triangle easement.  Where the sight distance triangle easement is proposed to accomplish the required corner right-of-way chamfer in Section 16.24.040.C, the easement shall be dedicated as a public improvements and sight distance triangle easement and meet the minimum chamfer right-of-way standards in Section 16.24.040.C. 
E. Private Access Easements. Private access easements shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) feet wide. 
F. Cross Lot Access Easements.  Private cross access easements may be required across any lot fronting on an arterial or collector street to minimize the number of access points and facilitate access between and across individual lots.  The location and dimension of said easement shall be determined by the City Engineer. 
G. Easements for Maintenance of HOA or Metro District Facilities.  Homeowner association or metropolitan district facilities shall be placed in easements or tracts including walls, fences, landscaping, trails, pocket parks, detention ponds, drainage facilities, recreation facilities, signage, etc.  All easements or tracts shall be large enough and provide adequate access for maintenance by the necessary type of equipment. 
H. Depiction of Easements on Plat. All required easements shall be placed on the final plat by plat note or graphic depiction which shall note the purpose and limitations on the use, ownership, and maintenance responsibilities associated with the easement.  Further, all private drainage easements shall be marked private drainage easement on the plat along with a special plat note describing the perpetual ownership and maintenance responsibility for the private drainage easement noting that the City is not responsible for the maintenance of private drainage easements. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.060 Street Layout and Design.  Design and development of the street system shall conform to the requirements of this Title and the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications. The City’s functional street classification and design criteria, including design speeds and traffic volumes, right-of-way requirements, access conditions, planning characteristics, curb and gutter design, sidewalk width, street widths, travel lanes, parking lanes, street grades and other geometric parameters, are provided in the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications. 
A. Streets to Conform to Major Street Plan. The general location and alignment of collector and arterial streets, intersections, and interchanges shall generally conform to the Major Street Plan and any amendments thereto.  Whenever a tract of land to be platted embraces or abuts a major street designated on the Major Street Plan, such section of the major street shall be dedicated and constructed by the subdivider in the location and at the width indicated on the plan to the extent to which the subdivider is responsible for such dedication and construction in accordance with the findings of the traffic impact study.  If the City does not have a Major Street Plan in effect at the time a plat is submitted, the requirements for major street dedications shall be established by the City Engineer, subject to review by the Planning Commission and Council. Where identified by a transit provider or school district, bus pullouts shall be provided.  Where the subdivision traffic impacts do not result in full dedication or construction of the major street, the City shall have the option to negotiate with the subdivider for the full dedication and construction which may be partially paid for by the City or the costs of which may be recovered by the subdivider through a cost recovery agreement.  The City shall, at the City’s sole discretion, have the option of acquiring any right-of-way or public easements at the time of approval of the subdivision necessary to implement the Major Street Plan. 
B. Right-of-Way and Design to Conform to Major Street Plan.   Except in cases where the Major Street Plan specifies a greater or lesser width as a minimum, the minimum right-of-way, roadway, raised or landscaped median, planter strip, sidewalk and pedestrian way widths shall be as indicated in the Public Works and utilities Design and construction Specifications and Section 16.24.040. 
C. Intersections at Right Angles. Street intersections shall be at right angles (between 85 and 95 degrees), or as nearly so as topography and other limiting factors of good design will permit unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.  “T” or “cross” intersections shall be used whenever possible. 
D. Cul-de-Sac Design and Length. The design and overall length of a cul-de-sac shall be determined by topography, type of development, proposed density, and other physical factors which may warrant special consideration.  However, unless otherwise specifically approved by the City of Fountain Fire Department, no cul-de-sac be over 500 feet long, as measured from the curb line at the furthest end of the cul-de-sac to the center line of the through street to which it connects. 
E. Half Streets Not Allowed. Half streets are discouraged.  Half streets or portions of a street which do not permit at least two lanes of traffic shall not be allowed. 
F. Alleys. Where provided, alleys shall be fully improved to the specifications of the Public Works Design and Construction Standards.  Alleys in commercial and industrial areas may be permitted when such alleys are necessary for traffic circulation or loading or unloading. Where proposed, alleys must be open at both ends of a block. 
G. Temporary Dead-End Streets. Dead-end streets shall only be permitted on a temporary basis.  On streets which are stub-end streets designed to provide future connection with adjoining unsubdivided areas, there shall be provided a temporary turn-around at the stub-end or a temporary connection to another street if required by the City Engineer. If such a provision is required, the design for such stub-end or connecting street shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
H. Private Streets. Private streets are generally prohibited, except in mobile home parks, multi-family housing, including apartments, townhomes and condominiums, and planned unit development districts.  Where private streets are allowed, provision shall be made to assure that all lots accessing private streets have a legal right to use such streets.  Proposed private street design and construction standards shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer.  Private streets should not be allowed where a public street has been extended.  Private streets shall be delineated in a tract that contains just the street or may be located in a common tract in a multi­family or townhome development.  Whenever private streets are shown on a plat, a special plat not is required stating the perpetual ownership and maintenance responsibility for the private streets. 
I. Extension of Streets. Existing streets, including streets shown on a valid preliminary plat, which adjoin a proposed plat shall be continued at equal or greater width and in similar alignment to streets proposed in the subdivision.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the property to be subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless such extension is not necessary for the connection of the subdivision with the existing street system, or not the most advantageous for future development of adjacent tracts. Streets connecting to streets in an adjoining subdivision shall be of equal width in right­of-way and street section.  The streets shall be stubbed regardless of the adjacent parcel’s current status. 
J. Street Classification and Layout. Local and collector streets shall be laid out so that their use by major through traffic will be discouraged.  Expected volumes on proposed streets should not exceed the range acceptable for their assigned classification. 
K. Combined Access Points.  The provision of combined access points, to serve two (2) or more lots or business uses, is encouraged in commercial areas to minimize disruptions to traffic flow along the adjacent collector or arterial roadway. 
L. Noise Mitigation from Streets.  Where a subdivision borders or contains a state or federal highway right-of-way or contains or is proposed to contain a major collector or arterial by the Major Street Plan, the City may require adequate provisions for reduction of noise.  A parallel street, landscaping, screening, sound wall, easement, greater lot depth, increased rear yard setbacks and fencing, among others, are some appropriate measures for mitigating undesired noise and other highway impacts.  A noise study may be required to determine what mitigation is appropriate.  All proposed mitigation shall be placed in an easement or tract and be maintained by the homeowner association or metropolitan district. 
M. Efficiency of Arterials Not Compromised. The local roadway system should not detract from the efficiency of the arterial roadway system.  Collector and local streets shall not intersect the same side of an arterial street at intervals of less than that allowed by the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications, except as may be otherwise specified by an adopted access management plan for the arterial street.  Ideally, local streets should not directly access arterial facilities. 
N. Rail Crossings. Where railroad crossings are proposed or are affected, provisions for grade separations, buffer strips and safety protection devices shall be provided by the subdivider or railroad as required. Obtaining approval from the affected railroad company and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission where applicable shall be the subdivider’s responsibility. 
O. Landscape Strip or Curb Lawn. Where curbs with separated sidewalk are to be provided, the planting area or that unpaved portion of the right-of-way between the curb and the sidewalk shall be landscaped and maintained by the abutting property owners.  Landscaping shall normally be limited to sod or seeding as determined by the subdivider or landowner, except that trees, shrubs or other plant materials may be used subject to City approval of the location and species of planting materials to be installed.  Xeric landscaping is encouraged by the City of Fountain. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.070 Sidewalks.  Sidewalks shall conform to the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications. Sidewalks shall meet ADA Guidelines.  Pedestrian curb ramps shall be constructed at all pedestrian crosswalks at all intersections.  Pedestrian curb ramps shall also be required where public sidewalks cross driveways with curbs.  All sidewalks shall be a minimum of 5 feet in width.  If determined necessary by the City Engineer, sidewalk widths may be required to be expanded in areas anticipated to carry higher numbers of pedestrians. Safe routes to schools shall be identified.  Where off-site sidewalks are required to complete a safe route to school, the subdivider shall be responsible for its installation including all crosswalks and ramps where public easements or right-of-way exists.  All identified safe routes shall be required to be completed at the time of approval of issuance of half of the building permits within any phase of the subdivision. 
A. Sidewalks in Residential Areas.  Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of every street for all developments with a net density of two (2) dwelling units per acre or greater; for developments of less than two (2) dwelling units per acre, sidewalks are required on one side of every street. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of every street as property is platted within three (3) blocks of any school site. 
B. Sidewalks in Commercial Areas. In commercial zones, sidewalks shall be required on both sides of every street. 
C. Sidewalks in Industrial Areas. Sidewalks are required on both sides of arterial streets in industrial zones and may be required along both sides of other streets when special circumstances warrant their installation such as high numbers of employees or the presence of mixed uses generating customer traffic. 
D. Curb Ramps.  Pedestrian curb ramps shall be constructed at all pedestrian crosswalks at all intersections.  Pedestrian curb ramps shall also be required where sidewalks cross driveways with curbs.  All ramps shall meet Federal American’s with Disability Act Standards. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.080 Perimeter Fences. The subdivider shall install a solid, opaque six-foot-high perimeter fence along all community and industrial/commercial collectors, community arterials or expressways adjacent to a residential subdivision within an easement or tract where lots will back to the collector, arterial or expressway street.  A perimeter fence may also be required in industrial subdivisions. 
Perimeter fences along arterials and expressways shall be constructed of durable material, such as stone, masonry, or architectural bloc.  Perimeter fences along collectors shall be constructed of durable materials such as stone, masonry or architectural block or upon approval by the Planning Commission, other material such as vinyl or wood.  Chain link fence shall not be permitted for perimeter.  Perimeter fencing shall include brick or stone columns, a minimum of two (2) feet in width and depth, spaced a maximum of sixty-five (65) feet apart.  In some cases, such as adjacent to parks or in special streetscape situations, fencing may be modified to include low profile, split rail, or wrought iron fencing. All horizontal-supporting structures shall be constructed toward the interior of the project or lot to reduce visibility of the support structures from streets and other public areas.  Offsets in perimeter fences a minimum of five (5) feet in depth and approximately 300-400 feet long with a ten (10) feet long gap between perimeter fences for landscaping using trees and shrubs provided every 200 feet or less.  An offset is a location where the perimeter fence is broken and a new section of perimeter fence is set toward the inside or outside of the perimeter fence on either side of the offset.  Breaks in perimeter fencing for pedestrian walkways are encouraged. Where a park or open space adjoins a collector or arterial street, perimeter fencing shall not be required.  Perimeter fences shall be maintained in perpetuity by the homeowners association or metropolitan district.  Alternative designs that meet the intent of this section may be approved by the Planning Commission or Subdivision Administrator in association with a Preliminary or Final Plat.  A request to eliminate a perimeter fence shall be considered a variance and shall be approved by the Planning commission at the time of Preliminary or Final Plat approval. 
No more than fifty (50) percent of the building permits within any given phase of a subdivision shall be authorized for issuance prior to perimeter open space landscaping and perimeter fencing being completed in such phase.  The Subdivision Administrator may issue an extension for installation of perimeter landscaping or fencing due to weather unfavorable to planting; such extension not to exceed nine (9) months.  Financial surety shall be provided for all perimeter landscaping or fencing for which an extension is granted. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.090 Overlot Grading. 
A. Grading to Complement Topography. Grading should complement the natural topography, land forms and vegetation of the site.  Grading should be accomplished so as to leave a natural appearance to the land, rather than creating sharp breaks between grading planes. 
B. Maximum Slopes and Retaining Walls. Subdivision grading should maintain minimum slopes of two (2) percent and maximum slopes of three (3) to one (1).  Retaining walls of a height greater than four (4) feet shall require design by a structural engineer.  Areas of fill must be adequately compacted to ensure public safety. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.100 Drainage.  Drainage improvements shall be provided which protect public and private property and allow public and private improvements to function as intended.  Developed flows shall not exceed historic flows for the one-hundred year storm event.  All facilities shall be designed to meet the full spectrum of storm events. 
A. Standards and Criteria. All drainage shall be planned and designed in accordance with the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications and these regulations. Drainage studies, plans and improvements shall be consistent with the approved Master Development Drainage Plan (MDDP) or Drainage Basin Planning Study (DBPS).  Where a MDDP or DBPS covering the property does not exist, a MDDP or DBPS shall be developed by the subdivider and approved by the City prior to platting.  Basin transfers will only be allowed with prior approval from the City. 
B. Lands Subject to Flooding. Land within a floodplain or land which is subject to inundation by a one-hundred (100) year flood shall not be platted for occupancy unless the flooding condition is alleviated in conformance with the City of Fountain Floodplain Ordinance. All development shall be setback a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from the floodplain.  The floodplain setback area shall be shown as a “no build” area on the final plat.  The plat setback limitation may be removed provided a study of the land area and surrounding land that may be impacted by potential development is conducted and determines that development within the setback area will not to cause any adverse effects to the development or to any other properties from either increased flood heights, flow velocities, flow duration, rate of rise of flood waters, channel stability or sediment transport; provided, however, that any development shall not be considered as causing an adverse effect to any other properties by reason of increased flood heights if such development does not cause a rise of more than one-tenth (1/10th) of a foot in the base flood elevation of the floodplain. The study shall be produced by a geo-technical engineer licensed in the State of Colorado.  Such study shall contain an analysis of potentially unstable slopes, faulting, or soil conditions, etc., that may be unfavorable to development.  The study shall also contain, where appropriate, recommendations for special mitigation measures and engineering precautions that shall be taken to overcome those limitations.  The floodplain shall be platted in a tract and shall be maintained by a homeowners association or metropolitan district. 
C. Historical Flows Maintained. Historical flow patterns and runoff amounts shall be maintained in such a manner that would preserve the natural character of the area and prevent property damage of the type generally attributed to runoff rate and velocity increases, diversion concentrations, or unplanned ponding of storm runoff. 
D. Use and Design of Natural Swales and Ponds.  Surface drainage shall utilize, wherever possible and practical, natural swales and retention/detention ponds.  Where possible, the bottoms of swales shall be lined with natural materials such as grass, rock, stones, sand or coarse gravel. Perimeter boundaries of retention/detention areas shall follow a configuration of natural land contours wherever possible to create a natural look to such areas. 
E. Storm Sewers and Associated Drainage Facilities. All storm sewers and drainage facilities such as gutters, catchbasins, bridges and culverts shall be installed and the land graded for adequate drainage as shown on the submitted and accepted plans, and shall be inspected and checked for adequacy with City standards by the City Engineer. 
F. Erosion and Sediment Control.  In addition to permanent provisions, temporary erosion and sediment control measures are also required during construction operations in accordance with the requirements of the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications and the City of Colorado Springs Drainage Criteria Manual, volume I and II.  The subdivider shall be immediately responsible for the protection and maintenance of all existing drainage facilities, including streets, until the improvements are completed and accepted by the City. Construction schedules are to be programmed to permit installation of required permanent sediment and erosion control structures as soon as possible.  Finished slopes are to be protected with a vegetative cover, riprap, or other suitable means.  The construction surety shall include 
provisions for enforcement of both the permanent and temporary erosion and sediment 
control facilities. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 

16.22.110 Utilities. 
A. Water and Sewer. Water and sewer shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the City’s overall utility plans, the Public Works and Utilities Design and construction Specifications, City of Fountain Water Distribution System Design & Construction Specifications manual, the Fountain Sanitation District Specification and Regulations Manual and the Widefield Water and Sanitation District Rules and Regulations.  Water and sewer lines shall be designed to permit the extension to all adjacent properties which may develop at a later time. 
B. 	Dry Utilities. 
1. 	
General Requirements. Utilities such as telephone, cable television, electric and gas services shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the special district or public utility, and all locations within public rights-of-way shall be approved by the City Engineer. These utilities shall be installed underground and shall be in place prior to street surfacing.  Electric transmission lines of greater than 30KV capacity are exempt from this requirement due to the prohibitive cost of undergrounding such facilities.  Transformers, switching boxes, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts, and other facilities necessarily appurtenant to such underground utilities may be placed above ground. 

2. 	
Notification of Utility Companies. It shall be the subdivider’s responsibility to contact all utility companies who hold a franchise agreement with the City concerning their intent to plat and to provide each such utility company a construction schedule in accordance with the specific requirements adopted by each utility company in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.23.100. 


C. Construction of Utilities.  No utilities shall be installed until a final plat is approved and recorded, the City Engineer has stamped the construction plans for the subdivision accepted, a development agreement or subdivision improvement agreement has been executed, all required surety has been posted, and the special district or public utility has approved the construction plans for the utilities. Utilities may be installed at risk upon approval of the preliminary plat where the City Engineer has stamped the construction plans for the subdivision accepted, a development agreement or subdivision improvement agreement has been executed, all required surety has been posted, and the special district or public utility has approved the construction plans for the utilities. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 16.22.120 Terrain and Vegetation Preservation. 
A. Fit with the Landscape. In the site planning and layout of any lot, consideration shall be given to the relationship of roads, lots and buildings to existing slopes, grades, natural vegetation and drainageways. All structures and roadways shall achieve a fit with the landscape that is not intrusive. 
B. Disturbance of Drainageways. Significant natural drainageways shall not be disturbed or re-routed except where of general benefit to the overall development and shall be subject to the review and approval of the City. 
C. Unique Site Features. Unique site features, whether topographic or vegetative, shall receive special consideration in any subdivision design.  Such features shall be left undisturbed wherever practical in lot development. 
D. Integration of Structures in Sloping Areas.  Lots and structures in sloping areas shall be designed to conform to the slope by means of stepped foundations or similar methods that will keep grading and site preparation to a minimum.  In principle, structures shall accommodate slope in design rather than cause slope to accommodate structures. 
E. 	Grading. Grading shall be shaped to complement the natural land forms. 
F. Visual Impacts. Visual impacts of commercial and industrial development upon offsite residential areas shall be avoided or reasonably mitigated. 
G. Wildlife Impacts.  Consideration shall be given to wildlife impacts in the layout of open space areas within the plat.  All subdivision proposals involving sensitive lands should be referred to the State Division of Fish and Wildlife for information and comment on animal habitat preservation. Where designated threatened or endangered species are present, the subdivider must conform to all applicable state and federal restrictions and permitting requirements. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.130 Plat Naming and Number Conventions and Standards.  All plats or documents filed for the purposes of compliance with this Title shall conform to the following naming and numbering conventions. 
A. Plat Naming. Plats including preliminary plats and final plats shall be named in accordance with the following naming conventions.

2. 	
No Duplication. No plat shall receive approval if the name duplicates or could be confused with the name of a subdivision of record within the City of Fountain. 

3. 	
Multiple Filings within Same Preliminary plat or PUD.  Multiple plat filings within the same preliminary plat or PUD area shall utilize sequential filing or phase numbers consistent with the name of the preliminary plat or PUD, unless they represent distinctly separate land uses (e.g., residential and commercial). 

4. 	
Replat.  Replat names shall be consistent with the name of the original plat filing unless the land includes more than one plat name, and characterized by an alphabetic descriptor after the filing number, and shall reflect consistency with the order of the original filing. 


B. Road Naming. Approval Required. Road names shall be subject to the approval of the El Paso Teller E9-1-1 Authority, in coordination with the City. 
C. 	Lot Numbering. 
1. 	
Sequential Numbering. The numbering of lots shall follow a sequential numbering pattern. 

2. 	
Lot Numbers Not Repeated in Same Block. Lot numbers shall not be repeated within the same block. 

3. 	
Lot Numbering in Case of Vacation or Replat. A vacation or a replat of lots or tracts shall conform to the following lot number conventions: 


a. 	
Vacating Common Lot Line.  When vacating a common lot line between two lots, the original lot number followed by the letter ‘A” shall be used to number the new lots (e.g., when vacating the common lot line between lot 1 and lot 2, the newly created lot shall be renumbered lot 1A). 

b. 	
Replat with Fewer Lots. When replatting 3 lots into 2 lots, the original lot numbers followed by the letter “A” shall be used to number the new lots (e.g., when replatting lots 3, 4, & 5, into tow lots, the new lots should be numbered lot 3A and 4A). 

c. 	
Adjustment to Common Lot Line.  When adjusting the common lot line between two lots, the original lot numbers followed by the letter “A” shall be used to number the new lots (e.g., when realigning the common lot line between lots 7 and 8, the new lots should be numbered 7A and 8A). 

d. 	
Replatting Entire Subdivision Filing.  When replatting an entire subdivision filing, the lots shall be numbered consecutively starting with the number “1”. 


4. 	Common Area Tracts Labeled.  Tracts that are common open space for the subdivision shall be labeled “Common Area Tract” followed by a consecutive letter designation beginning with “A”. common area tracts shall be further identified as either buildable or nonbuildable. 
D. 	Addressing. 
1. 	
Assignment of Addresses. Assignment of numeric addresses is the responsibility of the Building Official, in accordance with the Building Code.

(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.22.140 Survey and Monumentation Standards. 
A. Survey Closure Requirements. An accurate and complete survey shall be made of the land to be divided. A traverse of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision and all blocks, lots and tracts, when computed from field measurements on the ground must close within a limit of one (1) foot to ten thousand (10,000) feet of perimeter.  Boundaries shall be clearly indicated on the plat. 
B. Lot Dimensions and Distances.  Bearings and angles and lengths shall be given for all lot lines. In cases where a lot line is a common line only one set of figures, adjacent to the line described, need be given if the lot descriptions are given to the same bearing, not a reverse bearing. If table data is used, each individual lot shall be separately described giving all bearings and angles and lengths making each lot close by data provided and a table shall be included on the same page as the plat.  Should the plat drawing be of such a size as to preclude the data table then the drawing shall be developed in such a manner as to show a portion of the plat and its pertinent table on each sheet as required. 
C. Curved Boundaries. On curved boundaries and all curves on the plat sufficient data shall be given to enable the reestablishment of curves on the ground.  Curve data shall include: 
(1)
 central angle; (2) radius; and (3) arc length. 

D. 
Monuments. All subdivisions and exemption plats shall be monumented in accordance with C.R.S. §38-51-101 et seq.  Subdivisions shall be tied by angles and distances to the nearest accepted monuments.  All monuments shall be located and described.  Information adequate to locate and trace all monuments shall be noted on the plat.  Monuments shall meet the following at a minimum:

3. 	
Monuments shall be set not more than 1,400 feet apart along any straight boundary line, at all angle points, at the beginning, end, and points of change of direction or change of radius of any curved boundaries defined by circular arcs and at the end of any spiral curve. 

4. 	
Wherever any block is bounded by streets, the monuments may be set on the centerlines of such streets or on offset lines as designated on the plat.  Offset corners are the preferred means of monumentation. 

5. 	
The corner of lots, tracts or other parcels of land, all aliquot corners and any line points or reference points which are set to perpetuate the location of any land boundary or easement shall be marked by permanent markers appropriately secured with a durable cap. 

6. 	
If any corner falls within the traffic area of a street, road, or highway, the top of the monument shall be provided with a monument box, the top of which shall be set flush with the surface of the pavement.  No corner pins shall be set within the corner ADA sidewalk ramp construction zone.  Offset corners are a preferred method of monumentation within these zones.  Any offsets shall be designated on the plat. 



E. 
Supplemental Information to Submit with the Plat.  Closure sheets for the external boundary, blocks, lots and tracts of the subdivision, including the computed acreages for the entire subdivision, lots, and tracts shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator for review and approval prior to recording the plat. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 


16.23 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS 
16.23.010 General Requirements.  In association with each subdivision, the City shall determine the type, location and extent of  necessary improvements, depending upon the characteristics of the proposed development and its relationship to surrounding areas. Improvements shall be made by the subdivider at the subdivider’s expense according to plans and specifications prepared by a qualified professional engineer in accordance with the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications, Building Code, and these and other applicable regulations. Underground placement of utility lines shall be required in all subdivisions. These may include both on and offsite improvements necessary to support the subdivision and the development of individual lots within the subdivision. 
A. Completion for Improvements or Surety Required. The improvements identified in Section 16.23.010.B shall be constructed and installed by the subdivider, or provisions made therefore, prior to recording the final plat thereof.  In lieu of the completion of such improvements, the subdivider shall provide acceptable surety to secure to the City the actual construction of the improvements within such period as shall be determined by the Subdivision Administrator.  In all cases, surety is required to secure stormwater quality and erosion protection measures prior to beginning construction or site grading in accordance with Section 
16.20.060.E. 
Where construction plans have not been accepted prior to filing the final plat for recording, the subdivide shall not be required to provide surety until such time as construction plans are accepted and construction of improvements is authorized or the subdivider desires to release lots, tracts, parcels or other real property for conveyance. 

B. 
Improvements Defined. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate provision has been made for all on and offsite improvements reasonably related to the needs generated by the subdivision. At a minimum, the following improvement shall be provided by the subdivider: 


(1)
 survey monuments; (2) sanitary sewers; (3) water lines; (4) telephone and electric lines; (5) gas lines; (6) storm water drainage facilities and erosion control facilities; (7) curbs and gutters; 

(8)
 sidewalks; (9) street paving; (10) fire hydrants; (11) street signs and traffic control devices; and (12) street lights. The City may require any other improvements determined to be reasonably related to the subdivision and necessary to support the development of the subdivision including a percent of the anticipated costs of offsite improvements. 

C. 
Installation of Individual Wastewater Disposal Systems.  In areas where public wastewater systems are not accessible, individual wastewater disposal systems may be installed only after the approval of the Subdivision Administrator, local wastewater utility, and the El Paso County Health Department. 

D. 
Standards and Conditions for Construction of Improvements. Whenever improvements are required under this Title, the following provisions shall apply: 

1. 	
Cost of Improvements Obligation of Subdivider. The cost of                  constructing all improvements associated with a proposed subdivision                  shall be borne by the subdivider; and the construction thereof shall be at the sole cost, risk, and expense of the subdivider. 

2.
 Improvements to Meet Adopted Standards. 	All required improvements      shall be constructed in full compliance with the Public Works and      Utilities Design and Construction Specifications.  Subdivisions shall      also conform to all applicable special district and public utility      standards including the City of Fountain Water Distribution System    Design & Construction Specifications Manual, the Fountain Sanitation     District Specification and Regulations Manual and the Widefield Water     and Sanitation District Rules and Regulations.  While the City Engineer  

    shall make every effort to ensure that utility construction plans have     been approved by the applicable entity before authorizing the     construction of improvements, the City is under no obligation to enforce     any special district or public utility standards. 

3. 	
Construction Not Started Until Plans Accepted.  No grading or construction of improvements shall be started until the City Engineer has stamped the construction plans accepted and all other requirements of Section 16.20.060.E have been met. 




(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.020 Review and Acceptance of Construction Plans.  No later than the time of final plat submittal, the subdivider shall submit construction plans and specifications for all required improvements to the Cit Engineer for review and acceptance.  The construction plans shall be stamped accepted by the City Engineer prior to initiating construction and prior to final plat recordation.  Cost estimates to be used for purposes of the required surety shall be based upon the accepted construction plans. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.030 Subdivision Improvements Agreement.  Prior to initiating construction or recording the final plat, the subdivider shall enter into a development agreement or SIA.  The SIA shall identify the improvements required to be constructed, and shall provide the required surety to secure that the necessary improvements will be constructed to established standards in a timely manner.  All mortgagees shall be required to subordinate their lien and interest in the property to the real covenants and restrictions of the SIA.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.040 Surety Requirements. 
A. Acceptable Surety.  Acceptable surety in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit, bond, cash or other type approved by the City Attorney shall be submitted with the SIA to secure and guarantee performance by the subdivider under the terms and conditions of said agreement.  The amount of such surety shall be one hundred and twenty 
(120)
 percent of the cost of all improvements as estimated by the City Engineer plus the stormwater quality and erosion control surety required by Section 16.23.040.E. 

B. 
No Sale of Lots or Building Permits as Surety.  In lieu of financial forms of surety, the City and subdivider may agree that the subdivider shall construct all improvements prior to the sale of lots and issuance of building permits in the subdivision.  Upon completion of the improvements and the acceptance thereof by the City, the City may approve the recording of the plat, sale of lots and issuance of building permits in the subdivision.  Regardless, financial surety shall be required to secure the stormwater quality and erosion control measures during construction including estimated restoration costs and any changes to existing infrastructure in conformance with the requirements of Section 16.20.060.E.  Financial surety shall also be required to secure the improvements over the term of the warranty period. 

C. 
Waiver of Surety Requirements.  With its approval of a final plat, the City Engineer may waive the surety required if it determines that only minimal improvements are required. 

D. 
Partial Release of Surety.  As improvements are completed, the subdivider may apply for a reduction in the amount of surety being held by the City.  The City Engineer may approve any such request. Acceptance shall not be required to reduce the amount of surety.  At no time shall the total surety available to the City be less than twenty (20) percent of the City Engineer’s estimate of the total cost of improvements. 

E. 
Stormwater Quality and Erosion Control Surety. In all cases, surety is required to secure stormwater quality and erosion control measures prior to beginning construction or site grading. Such surety shall be one hundred and twenty-five (125) percent of all estimated costs of implementing the proposed stormwater and erosion control measures as well as land revegetation and stabilization costs in the event the project is abandoned.  The stormwater quality and erosion control surety shall not be released until such time as all lands disturbed by the action are fully revegetated and stabilized.  Failure to maintain stormwater quality and erosion control measures in accordance with the approved plans and the City of Colorado Springs Drainage Criteria Manual Volumes I and II, as amended shall be termed a violation of the SIA.  Written notice of such violation shall be provided to the subdivider by the City Engineer.  If the violation is not repaired within seven (7) days of notice thereof, the City may correct said violation and may apply the surety to pay the cost of such repairs or may employ any other lawful remedy to secure correction or repair of such violation and recover any costs incurred by the City in doing so.  The City may also repair any violation posing an immediate threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public without providing seven (7) days notice and bill the subdivider for the reasonable costs of such corrections.  The City may apply the surety to pay the costs of such corrections or may employ any other lawful remedy to secure correction or repair of such violation and recover any costs incurred by the City in doing so.   (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 

16.23.050 Acceptance of Public Improvements. 

A. 
Request for Acceptance. After completion of all improvements to be constructed pursuant to the SIA, the subdivider shall request in writing that the City Engineer issue a Certificate of Acceptance.  At his discretion, the City Engineer may, by written notice, require that said request be accompanied by a letter from a professional engineer stating that said improvements have been completed and installed in accordance with the SIA, the accepted construction plans, and applicable design and construction specifications of the City.  As-built drawings certified by said professional engineer shall be submitted for all improvements along with the required warranty surety prior to issuance of a Certificate of Acceptance.  Subdivision improvements shall also conform to all applicable special district and public utility standards including the City of Fountain Water Distribution System Design & construction Specifications Manual, the Fountain Sanitation District Specification and Regulations Manual and the Widefield Water and Sanitation District Rules and Regulations.  While the City Engineer shall make every effort to ensure that utility have been constructed and approved by the applicable entity before issuing a Certificate of Acceptance, the City is under no obligation to enforce any special district or public utility standards. 

B. 
City Engineer’s Acceptance.  The City Engineer shall cause the improvements to be inspected.  If the City Engineer determines that all public improvements are completed without significant defects and that they comply with the provisions of the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications, subdivision approval, and the SIA, the City Engineer shall issue a Certificate of Acceptance; and the surety shall be released. 

C. 
Identification and Action Concerning Defects.  If the City Engineer determines that any improvements are not complete, or if they are complete, they contain significant defects, the City Engineer shall inform the subdivider in writing of the improvements requiring completion or repair and shall not issue a Certificate of Acceptance until the specified improvements are completed or repaired.  Upon receipt of this written notice, the incomplete or defective improvements shall be completed or repaired within ninety (90) calendar days unless extended by the City Engineer.  Request for a time extension shall be made in writing and shall be based on inclement weather or other similar circumstances beyond the subdivider’s control. 

D. 
Required Improvement Completion Date.  All improvements shall be completed by the subdivider by the date indentified in the SIA which may be extended through an amendment to the SIA.  If no certificate of acceptance has been requested prior to this date, the City may construct, complete, or repair any improvements required under such agreement and may apply any surety to pay the costs of completion, correction, or repair of such improvements.  Upon completion, correction, or repair of such improvements, the City Engineer shall issue a Certificate of Acceptance. 

E. 
Renewal and Expiration of Surety. The subdivider shall be responsible for renewing or extending any surety that may expire prior to the completion and acceptance of all improvements.  Failure of the subdivider to renew or extend (in a timely manner) any surety held by the City prior to its expiration date may result in the City drawing on such surety prior to its expiration date. In no event shall building permits be issued for lots in the subdivision if the surety has expired. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 


16.23.060 Warranty Period for Improvements. The subdivider shall warrant and guarantee that all improvements required in this Title are constructed in a workmanlike manner and as specified by the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications, subdivision approval, and SIA. The warranty period for improvements shall run for a period of two (2) years from the date of acceptance by the City.  The subdivider shall provide acceptable surety in the amount of twenty (20) percent of the City Engineer’s estimate of the total cost of improvements to cover the warranty period for the improvements.  The warrantee shall be released by the City Engineer after all obligations have been met.  Upon the release of the warrantee surety, the improvements shall be considered to have been accepted by the City.  The City Engineer shall not release the warrantee surety until approval of the improvements owned and operated by a special district or public utility have been received from all special districts and public utilities. 
A. Actions during Warranty Period.  Within two (2) years from the date of issuance of a Certificate of Acceptance, the subdivider shall repair any defect in materials or workmanship discovered in any improvements for which a Certificate of Acceptance has been issued. Written notice of such defect shall be provided to the subdivider by the City Engineer.  If such defect is not repaired within ninety (90) days of notice thereof, the City may correct said defect and may apply the surety to pay the cost of such repairs or may employ any other lawful remedy to secure correction or repair of such defect and recover any costs incurred by the City in doing so. If no defect is discovered within the warranty period, the surety shall be released by the City Engineer. The City may also repair any defect posing an immediate threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public without providing ninety (90) days notice and bill the subdivider for the reasonable costs of such repairs.  The City may apply the surety to pay the costs of such repairs or may employ any other lawful remedy to secure correction or repair of such defect and recover any costs incurred by the City in doing so. 
B. Failure to Correct Defect. If, at the expiration of two (2) years from the date of issuance of the Certificate of Acceptance, the subdivider has failed to correct any defect of which notice has been mailed to him, the City shall retain the surety for ninety (90) additional days to allow for correction of each such defect and for a claim to be made by the City against such surety in the event that such defect has not been corrected within the time allowed.  At the end of such ninety-day (90) period, the City shall release any surety against which no written claim has been made by the City Engineer. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.070 Cost Recovery for Regional and Other Improvements. 
A. Cost Recovery Agreements.  Notice to potentially benefited property owners that a Cost Recovery Agreement will be executed and filed for recording against their property shall be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting at which the Council will consider approving the Cost Recovery Agreement.  The Cost Recovery Agreement shall include a depreciation schedule for all improvements which shall depreciate the improvements to zero (0) in year twenty (20).  Interest shall also be calculated in the depreciation schedule.  Interest shall be the average of the prime rate over the previous ten (10) years.  Costs may be recovered at time of platting or at time of building permit authorization. 
B. Regional Improvements. In the event the subdivision will impact or utilize improvements which benefit other developed or developing areas (“regional facilities”), the SIA shall provide that in the event the applicable regional improvements are constructed at the time of approval of the final plat of any phase of the subdivision, or the City has received a commitment from a third party securing construction of such facilities, the subdivider, if determined to be a benefited property owner under Section 16.23.070 D may be required to pay a pro rata portion of the cost of the regional facilities.  In all other instances, where the cost of the regional facilities is initially borne by the subdivider, the subdivider shall have a right to cost recovery. The subdivider’s obligation to construct or participate in the cost of development of regional facilities must be secured as provided for other types of improvements, or as otherwise provided in a Cost Recovery Agreement approved by the City.  This section does not affect water and sewer cost recovery which are controlled by their own ordinances, regulations, and standards. 
C. Sharing of Street Improvement Costs. When a subdivider constructs necessary street improvements which benefit properties other than the property being developed by extending such improvements offsite, the Council may agree through the approval of a Cost Recovery Agreement to collect a pro rata share of the cost of such improvements from any person who subdivides the other benefited properties within twenty (20) years after completion of such improvements and to refund such moneys collected to the subdivider making such improvements.  Any subdivision plat of property within the benefited property shall not be approved until such pro rata share of the costs of such street improvements have been paid to the City for the benefit of the original subdivider.  The subdivider’s obligation to construct or participate in the cost of development of street improvements must be secured as provided for other types of improvements, or as otherwise provided in a Cost Recovery Agreement approved by the City. 
D. Sharing of Drainage Improvement Costs. When a subdivider constructs necessary drainage improvements which benefit properties other than the property being developed, either by oversizing or extending such improvements offsite, the Council may agree through the approval of a Cost Recovery Agreement to collect a pro rata share of the cost of such improvements from any person who subdivides the other benefited properties within twenty (20) years after completion of such improvements and to refund such moneys collected to the subdivider making such improvements.  Any subdivision plat of property within the benefited property shall not be approved until such pro rata share of the costs of such drainage improvements have been paid to the City for the benefit of the original subdivider.  The subdivider’s obligation to construct or participate in the cost of development of drainage improvements must be secured as provided for other types of improvements, or as otherwise provided in a Cost Recovery Agreement approved by the City. 
E. Determining the Benefited Area. The City Engineer shall determine the benefited area of the regional, street, or drainage improvements for purposes of review and approval by the Council. The City may determine pro rata shares on the basis of front footage, acreage, traffic report, or on any other equitable basis for the specific type of improvement constructed. 
F. Process for Documenting Eligible Costs for Recovery.  When the required regional, street, or drainage improvements have been completed, the subdivider shall certify the cost of such improvements with paid receipts to the City Engineer within one hundred and eighty (180) days after completion of construction.  Such cost of improvements may include offsite right-of­way or land acquisition. Failure to provide such construction cost information shall relieve the City of any responsibility to assist in the collection of the pro rata share from other properties in the benefited area. 
G. Recording of Cost Recovery Agreement.  All Cost Recovery Agreements shall be recorded in the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder against the benefited properties. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.080 Disclaimer. Although these regulations mandate the construction of improvements and that the subdivider furnish financial guarantees to secure such construction, the City does not warrant that the required improvements will be completed, in the event of the subdivider’s default.  The City, in its discretion, will determine which, if any, improvements are to be completed, considering the availability of funds from the financial guarantees, the status of completion and the need to mitigate public health and safety hazards.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.090 Private Improvements and Lands. 
A. Design and Construction Standards. In the event that the subdivision, is proposed to contain property or facilities to be held in common ownership for private use and maintenance, and where the City has determined that a significant public interest in the facility’s construction exists, the City may exercise its option to review the private facility construction plans, inspect construction activities and require improvement guarantees as part of the required SIA.  Where deemed appropriate, the City may require that the private facility conform to the specifications for the corresponding public facility as outlined in the Public Works and Utilities Design and Construction Specifications.  Such private facilities may include landscape areas and associated irrigation systems, recreational facilities, access drives, roadways and other types of common-use improvements. 
B. Ownership and Maintenance.  For a subdivision that includes easements or tracts to be used for common facilities including common open space or areas, private roads, detention facilities, water facilities, water augmentation obligations, landscaping or other features requiring maintenance, the subdivider shall establish a homeowners association, metropolitan district or other entity approved by the City Attorney or Subdivision Administrator to be responsible for the maintenance.  For subdivisions with three (3) lots or less, maintenance responsibility may be placed on the individual lot owners in the covenants without having to create a homeowners association, metropolitan district or other entity.  Prior to recording the final plat for any subdivision with maintenance requirements, the subdivider shall provide the Subdivision Administrator with the appropriate legal documents (e.g., covenants, Titles of incorporation, bylaws, maintenance plan and agreements, etc.) necessary to create the homeowners association, metropolitan district or other entity and to place maintenance responsibility on said homeowners association metropolitan district, other entity, or the individual lot owners.  The homeowners association, metropolitan district, or other entity documents shall not allow for the dissolution of the entity or a change in any provision concerning the maintenance of said facilities without the approval of the Council and shall allow for the enforcement against the entity and assessment of costs for maintenance undertaken by the City after notice to the entity against individual lot owners. 
C. Conveyance of Common Land.  Easements, lots or tracts to be owned and maintained by a homeowners association, metropolitan district or other entity shall be dedicated by both a statement on the final plat and warranty deed.  A plat note concerning the responsibility for ownership and maintenance of the easements or tracts shall be included on the face of the final plat. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.23.100 Open Trench Installations and Notice to Parties.  This section applies to excavation for any trench or opening of any trench located in an existing or proposed public right-of-way, public utility easement, or other public easement, for which telephone, telecommunications, internet, cable television, or in which similar other facilities are intended to or may be installed to provide a service to the subdivision (the “service providers”).  These provisions do not apply to water, wastewater, natural gas or electric facilities.  It is the City’s policy to encourage joint use of utility trenches by service providers with the cost shared among the participating service providers.  Sharing of joint utilities trenches shall be subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards.  During the development of the subdivision and prior to recording of the final plat for the property, the subdivider shall coordinate the excavation for any trench or opening of any trench with the service providers that will be providing service to the property.  The subdivider shall provide written or electronic notification to the service provider of the time and date which such excavation or open trench is anticipated to be available for installation of facilities by the service provider.  The City shall make available the list of service providers requiring notification at the Planning Department. Any service provider that receives written or electronic notification of an open trench and fails to install its facilities at the date and time specified by the subdivider, and wishes to serve a subdivision where the trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs and shall repair all public and private property to the condition which existed prior to such trenching. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24 DEDICATION STANDARDS 
16.24.010 Purpose.  The purpose of this Title is to provide minimum standards for required land dedication.  For a PUD, this Title shall apply only when the required land dedication has not been satisfied. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.020 Applicability.  The purpose of the City’s land dedication requirements is to ensure that adequate sites are provided to the City to accommodate a variety of public facilities necessary to accommodate new growth.  This Title contains the standards adopted by the City for determining the land dedication needs for schools, parks, water facilities, fire stations, police stations, and City administrative facilities.  Where an open space and public land dedication plan including land dedication conveyance schedule, has been adopted for a PUD in accordance with the City of Fountain Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of that document shall replace and supersede the requirements herein.  For all other subdivision proposals, the requirements spelled out in the following sections regarding land dedication or cash-in-lieu of land dedication shall apply. These dedication requirements shall apply to all new subdivisions and replats.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.030 General Requirements.  The subdivider shall convey and plat all land and public easements to the City as are necessary to serve the development with vehicular and pedestrian access and water, sewer, and stormwater utility services.  The land required to be dedicated shall be dedicated at the time of final plat recordation whether or not the required dedications are located within the boundaries of the plat being filed for recording.  In addition, all subdivisions shall comply with the school, park, water facility, fire station, police station, and City administrative facility land dedication requirements.  Dedicated land shall be free of all liens and encumbrances, including any private covenant declarations.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.040 Right-of-Way and Easement Dedication. 
A. Rights-of-Way and Public Easements Required at Time of Final Plat.  Every street, alley, walkway, drainage channel, reserve strip (or waiver of access rights), easement, and other right-of-way shown on the final plat intended for public use shall be offered for dedication at the time the final plat is filed.  In addition, the subdivider shall provide right-of-way and public easements for all onsite and offsite streets, utilities, sidewalks and appurtenant landscaping.  The subdivider shall pay all acquisition costs.  If any offsite sights-of-way or public easements are required, before approval of the final plat, one of the following must have occurred:  (1) the city has received signed deeds for all offsite rights-of-way and public easements; or (2) the subdivider has executed a City contract for real property acquisition and deposited the estimated acquisition costs into a City trust account, and the subdivider has formally requested and the Council has approved a resolution of intent to use its powers of condemnation to acquire the rights-of-way or easements. 
B. Minimum Right-of-Way Dedication Standards. Concurrent with the recording of a final plat, right-of-way dedication is required for all subdivisions that abut or contain a street for which insufficient dedication has been secured.  Right-of-way dedication requirements are listed in Table 16.24.040-1. The requirement to dedicate right-of-way shall be limited by Section 
16.22.060. 
Table 16.24.040-1 Right-of-Way Dedications 
Street Classification  Right-of-Way Width (ft)1, 2  
Expressways  160-2105  
Community Arterials  110-1205  
Community Collectors  80  
Industrial/Commercial Collectors/Locals  65  
Minor Residential Collectors  60  
Residential  604  
Cul-de-Sac  100-1503  
Alley  24  
1Additional right-of-way for right turn lanes and second left turn lanes may be required based on the TIA at arterial and collector street intersections at the discretion of the City Engineer. 2The City may require additional dedication of right-of-way for public purposes. 3The width varies depending on the street classification. 4This may also be accomplished with a fifty-foot (50’) right-of-way and one ten-foot (10’) public improvement and utility easements on each side of the right-of-way. This may alternative dedication may only be proposed where a 6” thick, 5½’ wide attached sidewalk with mountable curb will be constructed. In this case, the ten-foot (10’) public improvement and utility easement shall be considered to have fulfilled the requirements of Section 16.22.050. 5The required right-of-way dedication varies depending on the number of lanes.  

C. Corner Right-of-Way Chamfers.  At the intersection of all public streets, the right-of­way dedication shall include a chamfer corner.  The diagonal chamfer for corner lot lines adjacent to roadway intersections a minimum of fifteen (15) feet as measured along the two legs of the projected intersecting property lines.  If a radial corner property line is desired in lieu of a diagonal, then the radial chamfer corner shall have a minimum twenty-five (25) foot radius.  The chamfer line whether diagonal or radial must provide approximately twelve (12) feet clearance from the curb face to the chamfer property line in order to accommodate a standard ADA sidewalk ramp with level sidewalk landing area.  In addition, the chamfer shall be sized to ensure that all property corner pins are outside of the corner ADA sidewalk ramp construction zone. This may also be accommodated by the placement of offset corners.  No corner pins shall be set within the corner ADA sidewalk ramp construction zone.  Note that the standard dimension represents the minimum chamfer corner.  The required chamfer size may vary depending upon the roadway curb radius and the intersecting angle of the intersecting property lines in relationship with the intersecting roadway alignments.  Where the sight distance easements required by Section 16.22.050.D fully encompass the required corner right-of-way chamfer and said easements are designated as public improvements and sight distance triangle easement, corner right-of-way chamfers shall not be required. 
D. Minimum Easement Widths. When sewer, stormwater or drainage, water, power, communications or other public utilities are constructed on private property, a public utility easement must be granted to the City.  These easements are needed to establish rights for the City and other utility providers including, but not limited to, construction, operation, and maintenance access as needed to own and operate the facility.  In addition, all private easements necessary to serve a subdivision shall be dedicated.  The minimum required width of all easements shall conform to the requirements in Section 16.22.050.  However, the width of the required easements are governed by factors such as the type of utility, its depth, size or diameter, the equipment needed for maintenance, etc.  The minimum width may be increased as determined necessary by the City Engineer or as otherwise required by the utility company. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.050 Park and Open Space Dedication Standards and Procedures. 
A. Requirement to Dedicate Park and Open Space Lands. Whenever land is proposed for residential, commercial, office or industrial use, the subdivider shall provide land, cash-in­lieu of land dedication, or a combination of land and cash to meet the active and passive recreational demands generated by the proposed subdivision as identified in the City’s parks and open space plans and studies. These lands must be suitable for neighborhood and community parks or open space, and typical facilities in terms of topography, size and location.  Where a subdivision is of such a residential density or size, or commercial/office/industrial acreage as to not require the dedication of a full park site, the City shall require cash-in-lieu of onsite, or an appropriate offsite, park land dedication. 
B. Dedication Standards. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this Title shall be reasonably adaptable for use as park, open space, trail, or other recreational purpose.  Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park areas shall include size, shape, topography, geology, flora, fauna, access, and location. Table 16.24.050-1 establishes the park and open space dedication requirement.  The formula used to calculate the minimum amount of land dedication required is based on eight (8) acres/one thousand (1,000) population:  two (2) acres/one thousand (1,000) population for neighborhood parks and six (6) acres/one thousand (1,000) population for community parks.

1Minimum onsite dedication: 5-acre site up to 25-acre site (if combined with elementary school), 10–12 acre site is optimum. 2Minimum onsite dedication: 30-acre site up to 100-acre site (if combined with secondary school), 60–80 acre site is optimum. 3 As a condition of preliminary or final plat approval, the subdivider may be required to provide land, cash­in-lieu of land, or a combination of land and fees for open space pursuant to, and to implement, the provisions of the Comprehensive Development Plan or any adopted master plans regarding open space when and if such dedications and fees are adopted by the City. Where a subdivision is of such a residential density or size or commercial/office/industrial acreage as to not require the dedication of open space the City shall require cash-in-lieu of dedication. Where open spaces are shown in the Comprehensive Development Plan or an adopted master plan, the City may require a subdivider to reserve the identified open space for those uses, as a condition of approval of a preliminary or final plat. The reserved area must be of such a size and shape as to allow: (1) the balance of the property to develop in an orderly and efficient manner, and (2) the reserved area to be efficiently used or divided if it is not acquired by a public agency. The amount of land reserved may not render development of the remaining land economically unfeasible. The public agency for whose benefit an open space has been reserved shall at the time of final plat approval enter into an agreement to acquire the area within two years, or longer by mutual agreement. As part of such mutual agreement, all or a portion of the reservation may be credited against other required dedications at the discretion of Council.  

C. Park Board Recommendation.  The Park Board shall, after review of master plans and a proposed subdivision, make recommendations to the Planning Commission and Council concerning the adequacy of provisions for park and open space needs in each subdivision application being considered. The Park Board shall consider the following criteria prior to making their recommendation:  (1) the conservation and maintenance of the natural environment of the region; (2) the provision of park land facilities which, with minimal development, will serve the entire region and will support outdoor recreation programs including, but not limited to, interpretation of the natural and historic qualities of the region; (3) the placement of park lands in such a manner as to assist in combating air quality problems, enhancing the environment, and preserving community integrity in the most practical, attractive manner possible; (4) the determination of the place the park and outdoor recreation facilities of the development occupy in the broad scope of the City park and trail system; (5) the assurance of the continuity of open space links, trails, and other major components of the open space system; 
(6)
 the determination of the population densities which will result from the proposed development and their relation to park and open space needs; (7) the assessment of the suitability of proposed land dedications for park and open space needs; (8) the examination of the size, shape, topography, geology, presence, and condition of ground cover and timber, condition of soil, drainage, location, access, and availability of water to lands proposed fro park and open space uses; and (9) the assurance of the protection of natural and historical features, scenic vistas, watersheds, timber, and wildlife. 

D. 
Dedication of Land Not Feasible. When dedication of required park and open space lands is not deemed feasible or not in the public interest, the Council shall require the subdivider, in lieu thereof, to pay to the City cash-in-lieu of land dedication in accordance with Section 


16.24.110. Said cash-in-lieu of park land dedication shall be paid by the subdivider prior to recording of the final plat or may be deferred to time of building permit on a per lot or dwelling unit basis. 
E. Dedication of All Required Land Not Feasible. When dedication of all of the required park and open space lands or when payment of all of required cash-in-lieu of land is not deemed feasible or not in the public interest, the Council shall require the petitioner to dedicate and to pay to the City a combination of land and cash-in-lieu of land in accordance with Section 
16.24.110. The combination of land dedication and payment of cash-in-lieu of land shall not exceed the total amount of land or fees required in by this Title. 
F. Trails. Local trail linkages are considered part of the subdivision’s overall circulation system.  Trails may be required in addition to sidewalks where such access is needed to connect the subdivision to nearby schools and other similar facilities in a more safe and convenient manner.  The Council may choose to credit regional trail right-of-way dedication towards a subdivision’s park land dedication requirement. 
G. Excess Park or Open Spaces Dedication. Open space lands for passive recreation and parks for active recreation provide significant value to the community.  The Council may choose to credit open space or park dedications towards a subdivision’s park land dedication where such open space is deemed to have significant public value and such dedication is determined to be in the public interest.  The amount of credit for excess open space or park dedication, up to a maximum of one-hundred (100) percent, shall be determined by the Council based upon the value of the open space or park to the community. 
H. Credit for Private Park and Open Space.  When subdividers provide their own private land for parks, recreation areas and facilities, and open space, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public parks and recreational services.  Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and open space in a subdivision may, at the option of the Council, be provided in the form of private land-in-lieu of dedicated public parks and open space. Applications for credit for private parks and open space shall be considered by the Park Board, and its recommendations shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission and to the Council. The amount of credit for private parks and open space, up to a maximum of one hundred (100) percent, shall be determined by the Council based upon the following factors:  (1) the extent to which such private land serves the overall park and recreation needs of the future residents of the subdivision; (2) whether the private land is reasonably adaptable for park and open space purposes, taking into account the size, shape, topography, geology, accessibility, and location of the site and whether the operation and maintenance of such private land as park and open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or restriction. In general, a substitution of private parks and open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the subdivider, as part of this obligation.  Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the City.  Private park and open space credits can only be applied to areas within a development that specifically have a right to use the private park or open space. 
I. Replat or Resubdivision. If cash-in-lieu has been paid or land dedicated for any residential land being replatted or resubdivided, no land dedication or cash-in-lieu shall be required, unless as a result of such replat or resubdivision, residential density is increased.  If residential density is increased, the subdivider shall pay the cash-in-lieu or dedicate land as applied only to the increase in the number of residential units. 
J. Combining with Adjoining Developments.  Where the subdivision limits the amount of land that can be dedicated, such park land or open space that is to be dedicated may, when feasible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments to produce usable park and open space areas without hardship on a particular subdivider. 
K. Park Development.  The subdivider shall be responsible for improving the park in accordance with established standards.  The standards for development shall be established by ordinance. Where raw land is dedicated and not improved as a neighborhood or community park, the Council shall require the subdivider, in lieu of improvements thereto, to pay to the City cash-in-lieu of park improvements.  Said cash-in-lieu of park improvements shall be paid by the subdivider prior to recording of the final plat or may be deferred to time of building permit on a per lot or dwelling unit basis.  The cost of improvements shall be set by the Council on a per acre basis based on a recommendation from the Park Board. 
L. Park and Open Space Dedication Credits. The Council may provide a subdivider credit for excess public park land and open space dedication in Association with any excess dedication. The credits may be used to offset all or a portion of park land and open space dedication requirements within subsequent phases of a subdivision or in other proposed subdivisions within the City. Credits may not be taken or applied without Council approval. 
While it is the intent of Council in allowing park and open space credit for excess dedications to encourage a subdivider to dedicate important or critical park lands and open spaces, allowing the redemption of the credit in association with any particular subdivision or phase of a subdivision is solely at the discretion of Council.  The use of a credit shall not have the affect of leaving an area of the City or a subdivision inadequately served by parks or open space.  Credits may be transferred from one subdivider to another with the approval of Council. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.060 School Land Dedication Standards and Procedures. 
A. Requirement to Dedicate School Lands. Whenever land is proposed for residential use, the subdivider shall provide land, cash-in-lieu of land, or a combination of land and cash to meet the school facility demands generated by the proposed development. 
B. School District Recommendation. The appropriate school district shall make recommendations to the City concerning the adequacy of provisions for school needs in each development proposal considered. 
1. 
Criteria. The appropriate school district shall consider the following criteria prior to making their recommendations:  91) the determination of the population densities which will result from the proposed development and their relations to school needs; (2) the assessment of the suitability of proposed land dedications for school uses; (3) the examination of the size, shape, topography, geology, presence, and condition of ground cover, condition of soil, drainage, location, access, and availability of utilities to lands proposed for school uses; (4) the assurance of the protection of natural and historical features, scenic vistas, watersheds, timber, and wildlife; and (5) the demonstration of a present or future need for a school site. 

2. 
Land Not Deemed Feasible or in Public Interest.  When dedication of all or portions of required school lands is not deemed feasible or in the public interest, the school district may recommend to the City one of the following options: 


(a) 	
Future Land.  Guarantee of future land dedication may be requested by the school district when dedication of all or portions of required school lands is not deemed feasible or in the public interest in a particular phase of development.  Prior to final plat approval, the subdivider and the school district shall enter into a written agreement in which the subdivider guarantees the future dedication of land for school sites. Said agreement shall be executed by the current owner(s) of the site(s) and the guarantor, who shall provide proof of ownership. The agreement shall include a legal description of the property to be dedicated in a subsequent phase of the subdivision and shall be recorded with the office of the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder. Said agreement shall be binding upon the subdivider’s heirs, legal representatives, successors in interest, and assigns. 

(b) 
Cash-in-Lieu. The requirement for the payment of cash-in-lieu of dedication in accordance with Section 16.24.110. 


C. Dedication Standards. Dedication of land, or the payment of cash-in-lieu thereof, or a combination of such dedication and such payment shall be made for school needs.  The following formulas shall be used to calculate the minimum amount of land dedication required in residential subdivisions (See Table 16.24.060-1).  These dedications shall serve as the basis for calculating any cash-in-lieu. 
Table 16.24.060-1 School Land Dedications-Unit Based Approach 
Type of Unit  Square Feet of Dedication per Unit3  
Single family detached1  871  
Single family attached, multifamily or other types of residential units2  359  
1Single family detached unit: A residential dwelling unit completely separate of other units and situated on its own lot. A mobile home subdivision or manufactured home shall be included within this definition for dedication requirement calculation, as well as patio home or townhome where not attached. 2Other residential units: All other types of residential units not included as single family detached units, including but not limited to attached single family homes, townhomes, condominiums, apartments, and mobile home parks.3Existing dwelling units shall be excluded from the calculation of the school land dedication requirement if they have previously been included in the calculation for school land dedication unless the lot on which the existing dwelling will be located allows for greater residential density in which case the dedication requirements shall be calculated based on the maximum potential residential density.  

D. Reductions in Dedications.  There is no land dedication for a public school site when the residential subdivision is zoned exclusively for nursing homes, retirement facilities, or similar proposals.  In addition, a subdivider may propose limiting dedications for school sites where the subdivider can document to the satisfaction of the City and appropriate school district that the subdivision will generate fewer students than the standard on which the dedication requirements is based. 
E. Minimum Site Size. The minimum acreage for the dedication of school sites is based upon the following standards: ten (10) acres for an elementary school; twenty-five (25) acres for a junior high school; and fifty (50) acres for high schools.  Where a subdivision is of such a residential density as to not require the dedication of a full school site, the City shall require cash-in-lieu of dedication.  The appropriate school district may recommend and the City may require where the total required dedication exceeds the minimum site area that all land dedications beyond the minimum school site size be contiguous.  The appropriate school district may also request and the City may require the dedication of additional land to obtain a full site or site large enough to meet the appropriate school district’s intended use.  Where the requested dedication exceeds the total dedication required, the appropriate school district is required to compensate the subdivider for the additional lands in the same manner and amount as cash-in­lieu is calculated pursuant to Section 16.24.110 or such other amount agreed to by the subdivider and appropriate school district. 
F. Suitable Lands.  Dedicated sites shall be a single parcel suitable for school facilities in terms of topography, size and location.  The dedicated school land shall be centrally located and provided with public access to adjacent street frontage and free from hazards that would threaten the safety of those using the land.  The following land areas shall not be considered to fulfill the requirements of any required public school land area requirement: 
• 
Rights-of-way or public easements. 

• 
Greenbelts, walkways, bikeways and trails. 

• 
Lakes, ponds, reservoirs. 

• 
Swamps and boggy lands. 

• 
Steep or rugged land areas. 

• 
Hazardous geological land areas and hazardous wildfire land areas. 


G. Combining with Adjoining Developments.  Where the subdivision limits the amount of land that may be dedicated, such school land which is to be dedicated may, when feasible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments to produce a usable school site without hardship on a particular subdivider. 
H. Dedication and Conveyance of Land to School District. If the appropriate school district determines that the dedication of land for school purposes is appropriate, the subdivider shall convey the property by warranty deed to the appropriate school district concurrent with the recording of the final plat. 
I. Collection and Transfer of Cash-in-Lieu.  If the appropriate school district determines that cash-in-lieu of the dedication of land for school purposes is appropriate, said cash-in-lieu of land dedication shall be paid to the City prior to the recording of the final plat or may be deferred to the time of building permit in which case it shall be collected by the City at time of building permit.  All cash-in-lieu collected by the City shall be paid to the appropriate school district on a quarterly basis by the City. 
J. Replat or Resubdivision. If cash-in-lieu has been paid or land dedicated for any residential land being replatted or resubdivided, no land dedication or cash-in-lieu shall be required unless as a result of such replat or resubdivision, residential density is increased.  If residential density is increased, the subdivider shall pay the cash-in-lieu or dedicate land as applied only to the increase in the number of residential units. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.070 Land Dedication for Public Facilities.  As a condition of preliminary or final plat approval, the subdivider may be required to provide land, cash-in-lieu of land, or a combination of land and fees for fire stations, library sites, child day care, public art, or any other public facilities pursuant to, and to implement, the provisions of the Comprehensive Development Plan or any adopted master plans regarding such facilities when and if such dedications and fees are adopted by ordinance.  These lands must be suitable for public facilities in terms of topography, size and location.  Where a subdivision is of such a residential density or commercial/office/industrial acreage as to not require the dedication of a full site the City shall require cash-in-lieu of dedication. All cash-in-lieu shall be calculated in accordance with Section 16.24.110. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.080 Reservations for Public Facilities 
A. General.  Where a recreational facility, fire station, library, or other public use is shown in the Comprehensive Development Plan or an adopted master plan, and the plan contains policies and standards for those uses, the City may require a subdivider to reserve sites for those uses, as a condition of approval of a preliminary or final plat. 
B. Limitations.  The reserved area must be of such a size and shape as to allow:  (1) the balance of the property to develop in an orderly and efficient manner, and (2) the reserved area to be efficiently used or divided if it is not acquired by a public agency.  The amount of land reserved may not render development of the remaining land economically unfeasible. 
C. Acquisition.  The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall at the time of final plat approval enter into an agreement to acquire the area within two years, or longer by mutual agreement.  As part of such mutual agreement, all or a portion of the reservation may be credited against other required dedications at the discretion of Council. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.090 Drainage Basin and Other Infrastructure Fees.  The Council may adopt drainage basin or other fees to fund infrastructure within all or certain portions of the City.  Such fees shall be adopted by ordinance and shall be payable as specifically established in the ordinance authorizing the collection of the drainage basin or infrastructure fee.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.100 Use of Land and Cash-in-Lieu.  All land and cash-in-lieu dedicated or credited under the provisions of this Title shall be used for its intended public purpose (land for school, recreation, and open space, fire, police or administrative facilities) to the mutual benefit of the residents of the subdivision, City and general public in accordance with the City’s, school districts’, or other special district’s adopted plans and policies for public uses and facilities.  The City, school district, or special district may exchange land previously acquired for cash if in the opinion of the Council or governing board of the school district or special district, the public need for that specific public use would better be served at a different site.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.24.110 Calculating the Cash-in-Lieu.  The Council may adopt and apply a schedule of fees for cash-in-lieu based on the adopted land dedication rates and an established developed land value which may be based on a citywide appraisal of developed lands, on the County Assessor’s average developed land value in the city, or some other acceptable method of determining land values.  The rate shall be adjusted annually based on changes in land values. The cash-in-lieu schedule may be applied to all lands being subdivided on a per unit or per lot basis. 
If the Council does not adopt a schedule of fees based on the dedication rates and an established developed land value, when cash-in-lieu of land area dedication is to occur, at the time of 
submittal of documents for a final plat, the subdivider shall submit an appraisal, purchase 
price or other indication of the actual market value of the buildable land area based on the 
approved preliminary or proposed final plat (i.e., value shall be based on anticipated market 
value after completion of platting and completion of all required public improvements).  The 
actual value of the land shall be determined by mutual agreement between the subdivider and the 
Subdivision Administrator.  In the event that the parties cannot agree on the actual value of the 
sites, an independent qualified appraiser shall be selected by mutual agreement of the disagreeing 
parties. Said appraiser’s findings on the actual value of the total site shall be final and binding 
on all parties. A qualified appraiser shall be a member of the Appraiser Institute (M.A.I.) or an 
Accredited Rural Appraiser (A.R.A.). The subdivider shall pay the full cost of said appraiser. 
This method shall establish the base land value for purposes of establishing the cash-in-lieu due 
at time of platting.  Where the fees are to be paid at time of building permit, the base land value 
and schedule of fees established at the time of platting shall be inflated annually by the average 
increase in land values within the City of Fountain as determined by a review of the County 
Assessor’s data. 

Developed land value is the value of the land following platting and completion of all public 
improvements. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 

16.25 CRITERIA FOR TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES 
16.25.010 Introduction.  This appendix outlines the policies and requirements for the preparation of Traffic Impact Studies (TIS) for development proposals in the City of Fountain. These requirements exist to ensure consistent traffic analysis practices for developments being considered. The responsibility for evaluating the traffic impacts associated with a proposed development rests with the applicant.  The applicant is responsible for retaining a qualified transportation professional to provide an accurate and complete accounting of probable traffic impacts related to the proposed development.  The City of Fountain Planning and Public Works staff are responsible for review of traffic impact studies to ensure that the study is completed accurately and in accordance with these requirements. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.25.020 When a Traffic Impact Study is Required.  Unless waived by the City Engineer, the City requires a TIS for any new development proposal that could potentially have a significant impact (as determined by the City) on the transportation system.  Any of the following may be considered significant impacts: 
• 	
Daily trip generation is projected to be 500 or more vehicles. 

• 	
Peak hour trip generation is projected to be 50 or more vehicles. 

• 	
Traffic from a development will impact adjacent residential neighborhoods. 

• 	
Driveway impacts on public streets related to turning movements or signal timing/progression. 

• 	
Offsite collector and arterial road links and intersections that are impacted by 10% or more (during either A.M. or P.M. peak hour). 

• 
Significant citizen concern due to expected traffic impacts. 


A TIS may also be required when a previously approved development changes or expands in such a way that the approved access to the site is affected or trip generation estimates increase by more than 20% over the original estimates.  A TIS may also be required for each phase of a large phased development.  In this situation, an overall TIS would be completed for the overall proposal followed by an addendum prior to the development of each phase.  (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.25.030 Traffic Impact Study Preparation and Review Process.  The Subdivider is responsible for contacting the Planning Division before a development application is submitted to determine if a TIS will be required.  The need for a TIS will be determined as part of the pre­application conference. 
Prior to the commencement of the TIS, a pre-submittal meeting must be held between the City Engineer and the transportation professional retained by the subdivider to discuss the scope of the study and the requirements for the study content and format.  The pre-submittal meeting is intended to provide a firm base of cooperation and communication between the City, the subdivider, and the transportation consultant.  At a minimum, topics discussed at such meetings will include study area, proposed land uses, trip generation, trip distribution, traffic projection year(s), intersections requiring analysis, signal timing assumptions and background traffic assumptions. 
The subdivider shall submit the traffic impact study at the time that the development application is submitted.  If the study fails to comply with the technical requirements and the scope of the study outlined in the pre-submittal meeting, the Subdivider will be advised in writing through the City’s normal development review process.  A study must be submitted and accepted by the City before the Planning Commission schedules the project for consideration. 
The City Engineer will review the draft study within fifteen (15) working days of the date of submittal.  If study revisions are needed, the City Engineer will normally review the revised study within ten (10) working days of submittal. A longer review period will be necessary if the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) or other agencies are involved in the review process. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.25.040 Traffic Impact Study Requirements. 
A. Study Purpose and Site Description. The study shall include a brief description of the development application proposal (i.e. annexation, rezoning, subdivision, site plan application etc.).  It shall also include a brief description of the development proposal including the site location, the size of the land parcel, general terrain features, the types of land uses being proposed and the proposed access points. 
B. Study Area. The boundaries of the study area will be based on engineering judgment and an understanding of existing traffic conditions surrounding the site.  The limits should be agreed upon at the pre-submittal meeting with staff.  The boundaries of the study area shall be based on the size and extent of the proposed development and it’s relation to significant streets and intersections.  Large developments may require a study area extending beyond one mile due to the magnitude of potential impacts.  As a minimum, the study area will include: 
• 	
Adjacent streets. 

• 	
Adjacent or nearest offsite arterial/arterial or arterial/collector intersections. 

• 	
Site access points. 

• 	
Internal roads. 

• 	
Offsite collector and arterial road links and intersections that are impacted by 5% or more (during either A.M. or P.M. peak hour). 

• 	
Continuity and adequacy of pedestrian and bicycle facilities to the nearest attraction (existing or planned); 

• 	
Access to the most direct public transportation services facility or public transportation services route where public transportation services are available; and 

• 	
Any pedestrian routes within 2 miles of a school. 


A vicinity map that shows the site and the study area boundaries in relation to the surrounding transportation system must be included in the study.  All arterial and collector streets in the study area and access points to the site should be shown on the map.  Key intersections in the study area that will be analyzed in the study shall be identified at the pre-submittal meeting. The key intersections should be identified on the map. 
C. Study Horizons. Three study horizons are required for analysis:  The current conditions, short term and long term.  The current (existing) conditions should be analyzed to establish a baseline of traffic conditions. 
The short-term horizon represents the planned opening year of the project.  Both a background analysis and analysis with the project completed should be completed to assess the short-term impacts of the project.  Assumptions about street improvements not associated with the study project in the short term should be based on projects shown in the City’s Capital Improvement Program or projects that have already been financially obligated to a subdivider. 
The long term planning horizon represents conditions at 80% build out of the Fountain Planning Area as shown in the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan (FCDP).  For land uses in compliance with the FCDP this analysis should be completed using forecast volumes and roadway improvements as shown in the FCDP.  For land uses that are not in compliance with the FCDP analyses for both the adopted land uses in the FCDP and the proposed land uses should be completed so that the impact of the land use change can be evaluated. 
When an overall traffic impact study is completed for a phased development the study shall look at all three study horizons. Addenda for each phase of development should only look at the current conditions and the short-term horizon. 
D. 	Analysis Time Periods.  Normally, the analysis time periods will be the weekday 
a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Under some circumstances the City may require analyses to occur at other times as appropriate. 
E. 	Existing/Base Conditions. 
1. 	
Existing and Proposed Land Uses. A complete description (including a map) of the existing land uses in the study area as well as their current zoning, shall be included in the study.  In addition, the future uses of all vacant land within the study area that may be developed within the projection year of the project must be identified. For the short term horizon only land where development applications have been approved should be considered as developed within the projection year.  For the long­term horizon, land uses shown in the FCDP should be assumed as developed within the projection year. 

2. 	
Existing and Proposed Transportation System. The study shall describe the existing roadways and intersections in the study area including the road geometry and intersection traffic control.  For the short-term horizon, assumptions about road improvements related to the development shall be based on the City’s Capital Improvement Program and on improvements already financially obligated to a subdivider. For the long-term horizon all improvements shown in the FCDP within the study area should be assumed. 

3. 	
Existing Traffic.  Current a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes shall be obtained for the roadways and intersections within the study area. “Current” means counts less than a year old.  A map or series of maps of the existing roadway network shall be prepared showing the existing conditions and volume counts including lane geometry, traffic control, access points, turning movement volumes and calculated peak hour factors. 

4. 	
Background Traffic. 


(a) 	
Short Term Horizon. For the short term horizon, background traffic shall be the sum of existing traffic volumes plus the addition of traffic from any not yet built but approved developments in the study area plus background traffic growth. Background traffic growth should be calculated from historical 24-hour volume counts in the City of Fountain in the vicinity of the proposed development.  Staff will provide this information when it is available. The annual percentage of background traffic growth should be agreed upon at the pre-submittal meeting. 

(b) 
Long Term Horizon. For the long-term horizon, background traffic shall be based on the most recent traffic forecasts from the City’s long range transportation model.  Maps of both the short term and long term roadway network shall be prepared showing the projected conditions and projected volume counts including lane geometry, traffic control, access points, a.m. and p.m. peak hour turning movement volumes and calculated peak hour factors. 

F. 	
Site Related Traffic. 


1. 	Trip Generation.  A summary table listing each type of land use, the size or amount involved, the trip generation rates used and the resultant total trips must be provided. Trip generation rates shall be calculated using data contained in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual or from a local trip generation study following procedures prescribed in the ITE Trip Generation Manual.  If a local trip generation study is used to determine the trip generation rate, documentation of the trip generation study and the resulting rate should be included in an appendix of the traffic impact study.  The ITE Trip Generation Manual presents data on trip generation rates in various formats.  A weighted average trip generation rate is shown. Also, when possible, a regression equation is presented that defines the line representing “best fit” of the data. Trip generation rates should be determined as outlined below. 
(a) Use Regression Equation When: 
• 	
A regression equation is provided. 

• 	
The independent variable is within range of data and 

• 	
Either the data plot has at least 20 points; or 

• 	
The R2 is greater than or equal to 0.75, equation falls within the data cluster in the plot and the standard deviation is greater than 110% of the weighted average rate. 


(b) Use the Weighted Average Rate When: 
• 	
At least three data points. 

• 	
Independent variable is within range of data. 

• 	
Standard deviation is less than or equal to 110% of the weighted average rate. 

• 	
R2 is less than 0.75 or no equation provided. 

• 	
Weighted average rate falls within data cluster plot. 


(c) 	Collect Local data When: 
• 	
Study site is not compatible with ITE land use code definition. 

• 	
Only 1 or 2 data points; preferably when five or fewer data points. 

• 	
Independent variable does not fall within range of data. 

• 	
Neither weighted average rate line or fitted curve fall within data cluster at size of development. 


Trip making reduction factors may be used after first generating trips at full ITE rates.  These factors fall into two categories:  those that reassign some portion of generated trips to the background stream of traffic, and those that remove or move generated trips.  In all cases, the underlying assumptions of the ITE Trip Generation rates must be recognized and considered before any reductions are claimed. 
The first category is when trips to the proposed development currently exist as part of the background traffic stream, referred to as pass-by trips.  Pass-by percentages identified by ITE or in other industry publications may typically be used.  But, the source of the percentages must be identified and the City must approve use.  Pass-by traffic must continue to be assigned to site driveways and access points, but is not additive to the background traffic stream.  An appendix that illustrates the assignment of pass-by trips must be included in the report. 
The second category for adjustments is for internal site trips, transit use, and transportation demand management (TDM) actions.  Reductions of these types may be allowed if analytic support is provided to show how the figures were derived.  The City must approve any reductions that are claimed.  Optimistic assumptions regarding transit use and TDM actions will not be accepted unless accompanied by specific implementation proposals that will become a condition of development approval. Such implementation proposals must have a high expectation of realization within a 3-year period after project initiation. 
2. 
Trip Distribution.  The percentage of trips to/from the proposed development to/from destinations in the region must be clearly shown graphically in the report. The consultant shall be responsible for estimating trip distribution.  Marketing studies, sub-area transportation studies, documented existing traffic patterns and professional judgment may be used to make trip distribution assumptions. Whatever method(s) are used, the procedures and rationale used should be fully explained and documented in the study. 

Different trip distribution assumptions can be used for different land uses in mixed-use developments.  If more than one set of distribution assumptions are made they should be shown on separate graphics. 

3. 
Trip Assignment.  Site generated traffic shall be assigned to the street system according to the trip distribution percentages determined in the previous step. The traffic assignment must be clearly shown graphically in the report. 


G. 	Analysis and Identification of Impacts. 
1. Tasks: The project impacts shall be determined through an analysis procedure that follows the sequence of tasks outlined below. 
• 	
Assessment of existing conditions. 

• 	
Assessment of short term background conditions. 

• 	
Assessment of short term conditions with the planned land use shown in the FCDP for the land being proposed for development (this task is only needed when the proposed development is requesting a land use amendment). 

• 	
Assessment of short term conditions with the proposed development. 

• 	
Assessment of long term background conditions. 

• 	
Assessment of the long term conditions with the proposed development when a land use amendment is being requested. 


2. Highway Capacity Analysis.  Assessment techniques for existing conditions, short term background and short term with the development will include a capacity and level of service (LOS) analysis for the key intersections identified in the study area during the identified analysis time periods.  For signalized intersections the analyses shall be completed using the operational analysis methodology shown in the latest edition of Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board.  Both volume to capacity ratio (v/c ratio) and level of service for each movement shall be reported in a table or diagram for each signalized intersection analyzed.  The overall intersection level of service shall also be reported. The City of Fountain’s benchmark for traffic congestion states that all signalized intersections should be maintained at overall LOS C or better. In addition, the benchmark requires that all movements that have 5% or more of the total entering intersection volume should be maintained at LOS C or better and have a volume to capacity ratio less than 1.0.  Therefore, any signalized intersections or movements at signalized intersections that exceed these thresholds should be noted. 
The capacity and level of service analysis at signalized intersections shall be performed using the following assumptions: 
• 	
Peak hour factors should be calculated on an approach by approach basis from the turning movement count data collected for the analysis. 

• 	
Right turns on red should not be considered unless specific data documenting the percentage of turns on red is collected. 

• 	
Unless approved by the City at the pre-submittal meeting all arrival types shall be assumed to be type 3 as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual. 

• 	
Signal controller unit extension should be assumed to be 3.0 for through movements and 2.0 for left turn movements unless otherwise approved by the City. 

• 	
Start up lost time should be assumed to be 2.0 seconds unless otherwise approved by the City. 

• 	
Extension of effective green should be assumed to be 3.0 seconds unless otherwise approved by the City. 

• 	
Traffic signal timing parameters for the existing conditions will be the actual signal timing in effect unless determined otherwise by the City. 

Traffic signal timing parameters for the short term background conditions and the short term conditions with the development will use signal cycle lengths between 80 and 120 seconds.  Cycle lengths and Individual green intervals will be calculated to provide the least overall intersection delay while maintaining all movements below benchmark thresholds whenever possible.  Clearance intervals shall be the actual times currently in effect for all scenarios analyzed.  Where different signal phasing from the existing is used for the analysis this change shall be noted in the list of traffic impacts.  Where traffic signals are part of a coordinated signal system or where proposed new signals are within a half mile of another signal the cycle lengths used for analysis should be the same at all intersections analyzed. 

• 	
Saturation flow rate will be assumed to be 1900 passenger cars per hour of green per lane (pcphgpl). 

• 	
Lane widths should be assumed to be 12 feet wide unless other data shows otherwise. 

• 	
2% trucks should be assumed for all movements unless approved otherwise by the City. 

• 	
Saturation flow adjustment factors should be as per the Highway Capacity Manual. 

• 	
Where dual left turns exist or are proposed they shall be assumed to operate in a protected only mode. 

• 	
Free running right turns that are not effected by the signal timing should be excluded from the analysis. 


3. LOS Analysis Unsignalized Intersections.  Level of service analysis for unsignalized intersections shall be done in accordance with the methodology for unsignalized intersections in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. The results of the unsignalized intersection analysis should be shown in the table or diagram used for signalized intersection results.  The following assumptions should be used for the analysis of unsignalized intersections: 
• 	
Duration of analysis period is assumed to be .25 hour. 

• 	
Peak hour factors should be calculated on an approach by approach basis from the turning movement count data collected for the analysis. 

• 	
2% trucks should be assumed for all movements unless approved otherwise by the City. 

• 	
Saturation flow rate will be assumed to be 1700 pcphgpl. 

• 	
Critical gap and follow up time shall be in accordance with the values given in the Highway Capacity Manual. 


4. Long Range Assessment. Assessment techniques for both long term background and long term with the proposed development will require analysis using the planning methodology for signalized intersections and the unsignalized intersection methodology for unsignalized intersections as outlined in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual.  The condition (i.e. under capacity, near capacity, over capacity etc.) for signalized intersections and the level of service for unsignalized intersections should be reported in a table or diagram. Assumptions for the long-range unsignalized intersection analysis shall be the same as for the short-term analysis.  The following assumptions shall be used for the long-range signalized intersection analysis. 
• 	
A peak hour factor of 0.9 shall be used. 

• 	
Cycle lengths between 80 and 120 seconds shall be used. 


5. 
Access Evaluation. Assessment techniques for existing conditions, short term background, short term with the development, long term background and long term with the development will also include an evaluation of each proposed access point.  Accesses should be considered intersections and included in the level of service/capacity analysis described above. 

Safety is the top priority at access points.  The City has developed standards for the spacing and design of access points to provide optimum safety.  Accesses should be reviewed to ensure compliance with City (and CDOT if on a State Highway) standards.  Proposed access points that do not meet the pertinent standards should be noted. In addition, all access points should be evaluated to determine what auxiliary lanes are required in accordance with City standards and the State Highway Access Code (where applicable). 

6. 
Evaluation of Signal Progression in Coordinated Signal Systems.  According to City Standards, intersections with the potential for signalization should be spaced no closer than one half mile.  If a development proposes an access or intersection that is projected to be signalized and is less than a half mile from other signals or other planned signals a progression analysis shall be conducted to demonstrate that a new signal can be installed without negatively impacting progression. 


The analysis shall consider all existing signals or possible future signals within one mile in each direction from the proposed signal location.  On existing coordinated arterials, it must be demonstrated that the existing bandwidth in each direction can be maintained with the new signal installed.  Where a new coordinated system will occur as a result of the new signal it must be demonstrated that a bandwidth of at least 45% can be achieved in each direction unless otherwise directed by the City. The following assumptions shall be used for the progression analysis: 
• 	
A cycle length between 80 and 120 seconds should be used for analysis. 

• 	
Actual prevailing speeds on the arterial shall be used for travel speed in the analysis. 

• 	
Split assumptions shall be based on projected turning movement volumes and designed to maintain all movements with at least 5% or more of the total intersection traffic at LOS C or better and below v/c ratio of 1.0. 

Where pedestrian volumes are expected to be high (to be determined in the pre-submittal meeting), side street splits long enough to accommodate pedestrians shall be used assuming a 4.0 fps walking speed. 

• 	
Where left turn arrows are anticipated, protected/permissive phasing should be assumed unless dual left turns are projected.  Then, protected only left turn phasing should be assumed. 

• 	
Lagging left turns will not be allowed for protected/permitted left turn phases. 

• 	
Any access where the required bandwidth cannot be achieved should be noted. Any such access shall remain unsignalized and have turning movements limited by driveway design and/or median islands to prevent the need for signalization.  Time-space diagrams shall be included in an appendix to the study. 


7. Other Analysis.   Where the City deems it appropriate, other types of analysis may be required in the traffic impact study.  Other types of analysis may include but are not limited to:  Sight distance evaluation, transit and TDM opportunities, pedestrian/bicycle needs, environmental evaluations and evaluation of neighborhood impacts. 
(Ord. 1412 §2, 2008) 
16.25.050 Impact Mitigation Measures. 
A. Summary of Analysis. A conclusions and recommendations chapter should be included in the traffic impact study.  The results of the analysis should be summarized in this chapter. This summary should note all impacts to the transportation system and recommendations for site access, roadway improvements and travel demand strategies needed to maintain traffic flow safely and at a level of service in keeping with the City’s congestion benchmark.  In the event that the analysis indicates unsatisfactory levels of service or v/c ratio at any study intersection a description of proposed mitigation techniques or physical improvements to remedy deficiencies must be included.  It should be noted if the recommended improvements are part of the City’s Capital Improvement Program, are already financially obligated to another subdivider or if there is currently no funding dedicated for the improvements. 
B. Transportation Demand Management.  If TDM measures are recommended to mitigate unsatisfactory traffic conditions a specific TDM Implementation Proposal shall be developed and presented to the City. If accepted, this Implementation Proposal will become a condition of approval of the land use action requested. 
C. Evaluation of Proposed Improvements. If unsatisfactory levels of service or v/c ratio are predicted by the study and recommendations are made for mitigation.  Additional analysis must be presented which demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation. (Ord. 1412 §2, 2008)

ARTICLE I.  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Chapter 17.10 Introductory Provisions 
Section 17.100 Title of Provisions. The regulations codified in this title shall be known and may be cited as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fountain. 
Section 17.101 Purpose of Provisions.  This Title is written in accordance with the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan and is designed for promoting the health, safety, convenience and welfare of the citizens of Fountain.  The title is intended to lessen congestion in the streets, provide adequate light and air, encourage the most appropriate use of land, ensure the protection and preservation of open lands and natural amenities and to conserve the value of property in accordance with the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan. 
Section 17.102 Statutory Authority.  The Fountain Zoning Ordinance is authorized by Title 31, Article 23, Section 301, and et. seq., of the Colorado Revised Statutes and is declared to be in accordance with all provisions of the statutes.  
Section 17.103 Jurisdiction.  Provisions of this Title shall be effective within the incorporated limits of the City of Fountain. 
Section 17.104 Effective Date. 
A. These regulations shall be in effect from the date of adoption by the city council of the City of Fountain. 
B. To the extent that the provisions of this title are the same in substance as the previously adopted provisions that they replace in the city 's zoning and subdivision ordinances, they shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as enactments unless otherwise specifically provided. Any situation that did not constitute a lawful, non-conforming building, use, or site under a previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful non­conforming status under this ordinance.  
Section 17.105 Relationships to the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan.  It is the intent of the planning commission and city council that this title implements the planning policies adopted by the planning commission and council as reflected in the comprehensive development plan and other related plans and planning documents.  The planning commission and city council reaffirms its commitment that this title and any amendment to it are in conformity with the adopted planning policies.  The city hereby expresses its intent that neither this Title nor any amendment to it may be challenged based on any alleged nonconformity with any planning document.  The Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan shall be used as guide in decision-making and may be reasonable grounds for denial or reconsideration of the application. 
Section 17.106  Severability.  Should any section or provision of this title be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the title as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so decided to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
Chapter 17.12 Application of Regulations 
Section 17.120 Application to Developments in Process 
A. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 17.53, Planned Unit Developments, all applications for development initiated on and after January 3, 2002 shall be reviewed pursuant to the review process and standards set forth in this title, as revised by Ordinance No. 1048 and effective on that date.  All applications for development submitted for review prior to January 3, 2002 shall be reviewed pursuant to the process and under the criteria set forth in applicable portions of this title in force prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 1048. 
B. No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building or structure shall be moved, altered or extended, nor shall any land, building, or structure be used for any purpose other than as provided for among the uses hereinafter listed in the district regulations for the zoning district in which such land, building or structure, is located. 
C. No building or structure shall be erected nor shall any existing building or structure be moved, altered or extended, nor shall any open space surrounding any building or structure be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity with the dimensional regulations, district development standards and supplementary regulations or other provisions hereinafter provided in the district regulations for the zoning district in which such building, structure, or open space is located. 
D. The General Regulations and Development Standards, Article III of this title shall apply to all uses as follows: 
1. 	
New buildings and uses of land: Additions involving expansion of the gross floor area of any structure by twenty percent (20 %) or more above than in existence prior to the effective date of this title. 

2. 	
A change of use: Prior to issuance of a building permit, conditional use permit, or granting of a change in use, the applicant shall demonstrate that the property will comply with all applicable regulations in this title. 


E. All buildings, parking areas, landscaping, signs, and other improvements regulated by the development standards in this title shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the approved plans filed with the City of Fountain, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building or use. 
F. The Zoning Administrator may allow certain improvements to be constructed or installed within an agreed upon time allowing for seasonal changes.  Such arrangements may involve cashiers checks, performance bonds or other methods as deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator to assure eventual compliance with this title. 
G. 	Every building shall be located and maintained on a "lot" as defined in this title. 
H. No parcel of land which has less than the minimum width, depth and area requirements for the zoning district in which it is located may be divided from a larger parcel of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of building or development as a lot. 
Chapter 17.14 Vested Rights 
Section 17.140 Site-Specific Development Plan.  For all site developments, the final approval step, irrespective of its title, which occurs prior to building permit, shall be considered the "site specific development plan" for purposes of Article 68 of Title 24, CRS as amended. "Site Specific Development Plan" means a plan describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use proposed for a specific parcel or parcels of property.  For detached one-family and two-family dwelling units, the final plat shall constitute a "site specific development plan."  
Section 17.142 Requests to Vest.  In the event an applicant for site development approval wishes approval to have the effect of creating vested property rights pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, CRS as amended, the applicant must so request, in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date said approval is to be considered, accompanied by the owner's proposed formal notice of the creation of the vested property right. 
Section 17.144 Terms. A vested property right has a duration of three (3) years from the date of approval in accordance with CRS § 24-68-104. In the event amendments to a site specific development are proposed and approved, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of duration of a vested property right, shall be the date of the approval of the original site specific development plan, unless the city council specifically finds to the contrary and incorporates such finding in its approval of the amendment. 
Section 17.146  Vested Rights by Separate Agreement 
A. The city council may, at its sole discretion, enter into a development agreement with a landowner and provide for the vesting of property rights for a period exceeding three (3) years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to: 
1. 	
The project will be clearly and significantly reduced impacts on the existing infrastructure. 

2. 	
The project will construct public facilities, water, sanitary sewer, drainage facilities and/or public streets that are oversized or extended to be of obvious strategic value to the community. 

3. 	
The project will provide public open space and/or public parkland significantly greater than required and/or provide public recreational facilities that are of obvious strategic value to the community. 

4. 	
A commercial project or commercial component of a mixed-use project must result in clear benefits to the city as evidenced by new jobs and tax revenue. 

5. 	
The project will make special contributions that are clearly in the public interest. 


B. Subsequent Reviews. Such agreement shall provide for subsequent reviews and approvals by the city council to insure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval. 
C. Limitations on Remedy. The establishment of vested property rights shall not preclude the application of ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by a local government including but not limited to building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes. 
D. Reservation. The City of Fountain reserves the right to undertake land use regulation of the site specific development plan in contravention of such plan, provided that the compensation required under CRS § 24-68-105 (1), is paid to the landowner.  The adoption of this Section is not intended, and shall not be construed, to enlarge the right of the landowner or the obligation of the city beyond payment of the required compensation under the vesting statute. 
E. Effect. Nothing in this section is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, CRS.  In the event of the repeal of said Article or a judicial determination that said article is invalid or unconstitutional, this section shall be deemed to be repealed, and the provisions hereof no longer effective.

Section 17.248 Planned Unit Development District (PUD) 
A. 	Purpose, Conditions and Standards. 
1. Purpose. Planned Unit Developments (PUD) are intended, to facilitate the achievement of the purposes and objectives of this title, the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan and to permit the application of new technology and greater freedom of design in land development than may be possible under the application of standard zoning districts. Developments, however, must demonstrate that flexibility from the provisions of the existing zoning will result in higher quality development and when one or more following purposes can be achieved: 
a. 	
The provision of necessary commercial, recreational and educational facilities conveniently located to housing. 

b. 	
The provision of well located, clean, safe and pleasant industrial sites involving a minimum impact on transportation facilities. 

c. 	
The encouragement of innovations in residential, commercial, and limited industrial development and renewal so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type, design, and lay-out of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings. 

d. 	
The encouragement of a more efficient use of land and of public services, or private services in lieu thereof, and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that resulting economies may inure to the benefit of those who need homes. 

e. 	
A better distribution of induced traffic on the streets and highways. 

f. 	
Conservation of the value of the land. 

g. 	
Preservation of the site's natural characteristics. 


2. Conditions. The use of the PUD provisions must be in accordance with the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan and is dependent upon the submission of an acceptable plan, and satisfactory assurances that the plan will be carried out. The PUD is an entire development program concept and shall be reviewed as a whole. 
a. 	
The planned unit development shall be considered by the planning commission and city council from the point of view of the relationship and compatibility of the individual elements, which make up the development and, only after specifically and properly applied for, may be approved by the planning commission and city council in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 

b. 	
The parcel being considered for a PUD must have been legally created pursuant to the subdivision regulations. 

c. 	
The request for PUD approval is a voluntary act by the applicant and does not require or imply any acceptance or approval by the city.  The proposed uses and densities may be deemed inappropriate after review by the city, and alternative action may be required of the applicant. 

d. 	
Staging of Development: Each stage within a PUD shall be so planned and so related to the existing surroundings and available facilities and services that failure to proceed to the subsequent stages will not have an adverse impact on the PUD or its surroundings at any stage of the development. 


3. Standards Generally. 	The following standards and requirements shall govern the application of a planned unit development: 
a. 	
The PUD shall be consistent with the intent of the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan and the principles and policies therein. 

b. 	
No PUD shall be approved without a plan setting forth the provisions for development of the PUD, including but not necessarily limited to easements, covenants and restrictions relating to use, location, and bulk of buildings and other structures, intensity of use or density of development, utilities, streets, roads, pedestrian areas, and parking facilities, common (or dedicated) open spaces, and other public facilities. 

c. 	
The design and construction of the PUD shall include adequate, safe and convenient arrangements for pedestrian and vehicular circulation, off-street parking and loading space. 

d. 	
While there may be no fixed setbacks and lot widths, the planning commission and city council may require such setbacks, lot widths and space between buildings as necessary to provide adequate access and fire protection, to ensure proper ventilation, light, air and snow melt between buildings, and to ensure that the PUD is compatible with other developments in the area.  As a general guide, twenty feet (20') between buildings is considered minimum distance for both nonresidential and residential buildings that are over one (1) story. 

e. 	
Open space for the PUD shall be planned to produce maximum usefulness to the residents of the development for purposes of recreation and scenery and to produce a feeling of openness.  All areas designated as common or public open space pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be accessible by proper physical and legal access ways. 

f. 	
The developer shall provide within the PUD central water and sewer facilities as required by the planning commission, city council, Fountain Sanitation District, the Fountain Water Code, the State Department of Public Health and the local health authorities. 

g. 	
The development shall be designed to provide for necessary commercial, recreational and educational facilities conveniently located to residential housing. 

h. 	
Clustered housing and other buildings shall be encouraged to promote maximum open space, economy of development and variety in type, design and layout of buildings. 

i. 	
Maximum height of structures shall be established in the approved PUD plan. 


4. 	Relationship to the Subdivision Regulations. The uniqueness of each PUD may require that specifications for the width and surfacing of streets, public ways, public utility rights of way, curbs, and other standards may be subject to modifications from the specifications established in the subdivision regulations adopted by the City of Fountain, if the reasons for such exceptions are well documented.  Modifications may be incorporated only with the approval of the planning commission and city council as a part of its review of the PUD. The modifications shall conform to acceptable engineering, architectural and planning principles and practices. 
B. Evaluation Criteria. The following criteria shall be utilized by the planning commission and the city council in evaluating any plan for planned unit development: 
1. Open Space - Residential Uses. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total PUD area shall be devoted to open space for residential uses. No more than five percent (5%) of the required percentage of usable open space shall be in the form of water surfaces, floodplains, steep slopes, or storm water detention areas. The city may consider the provision of other site amenities in lieu of the full twenty-five (25%) requirement for open space.  The open space requirement can be met through: 
a. 	
Development of active recreation uses such as traditional parks, play field, tennis courts, playground equipment, picnicking facilities, swimming pools, golf courses, greenways, trails and joint use school and park facilities. 

b. 	
Environmental preservation of significant natural areas such as bluffs and other geological formations, water bodies/ water resources such as irrigation ditches, wildlife habitat areas, fragile eco-systems (wetlands) and vegetative stands. 

c. 	
Preservation of lands which preserve significant views, provide transitions between different densities and uses (buffers) and otherwise serve to give shape and form to the proposed development and surrounding area. 


2.
 Open Space - Nonresidential Uses.  	A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total PUD area shall be devoted to open space for nonresidential uses. The city may consider the provision of other site amenities in lieu of a portion of the fifteen percent (15%) requirement for open space. 

3. 	
Residential density. Density shall be limited as required by the planning commission and city council upon consideration of the overall development plan and individual characteristics of the property. 

4. 	
Gross building floor area. The gross building floor area of uses other than residential may be limited as required by the city council upon consideration of the overall development plan and individual characteristics of the property. 

5. 	
Architecture. The following architectural standard is intended to prevent monotonous streetscapes and offer consumers a wider choice of housing styles. To avoid uniformity and lack of variety in design among housing units within the PUD, no home model elevation shall be repeated more than once every five (5) lots on the same side of the street (e.g., the first and fifth lots in a row may contain the same model elevation, but the second, third, and fourth lots must contain different model elevations). No home model elevation shall be repeated directly across the street from the same model elevation.  Mirror images of the same home model shall not count as two (2) distinctly different models. 

6. 	
Mixed uses. The PUD shall be designed, insofar as practicable when considering the overall size of the PUD, to provide commercial, recreational and educational amenities to its residents to alleviate the necessity of increased traffic and traffic congestion.  A PUD may include any uses permitted by right or as conditional use review, any other zoning district 

except that any use that has been declared a nuisance by statute, ordinance or any court of competent jurisdiction shall not be permitted. 

7. 	
Minimum area.  A PUD shall not be permitted on a parcel of land less than one (1) acre in area.  The minimum area requirement may be waived upon adequate justification shown by the applicant. 

8. 	
Internal compatibility of design elements.  It is recognized that certain individual land uses, regardless of their adherence to all the design elements provided for in this chapter, might not exist compatibly with one another. Therefore, a proposed PUD shall be considered from the point of view of the relationship and compatibility of the individual elements of the plan, and no PUD shall be approved which contains incompatible elements. 

9. 	
The PUD shall provide an adequate internal street circulation system designed for the type of traffic generated, safety, and separation from living areas, convenience and access. 

10. 
Private internal streets may be permitted if adequate access for police and fire protection is maintained and provisions for using and maintaining such streets are imposed upon the private users and approved by the planning commission and city council.  Bicycle traffic shall be provided for if appropriate for the land use. 

11. 
The PUD shall provide parking areas in conformance with the minimum site development standards of this title in terms of number of spaces for each use, location, dimensions, circulation, landscaping, safety, convenience, separation and screening. The PUD shall strive for optimum preservation of the natural features on the site. 

12. 
The PUD shall provide for a variety in housing types and densities, other facilities, and common open space. 

13. 
The PUD shall provide adequate privacy between dwelling units. 

14. 
The PUD shall provide pedestrian ways adequate in	 terms of safety, separation, convenience, and access to points of destination and attractiveness. 

15. 
The maximum height of buildings may be increased above the maximum permitted for like buildings in other zoning districts in relation to the following characteristics of the proposed building: 


a. 	
Its geographic location. 

b. 	
The probable effect on surrounding slopes and terrain. 

c. 	
Unreasonable adverse visual effects on adjacent sites or other areas in the vicinity. 

d. 	
Potential problems for adjacent sites caused by shadows, loss of air circulation or loss of view. 

e. 	
Influence on the general vicinity, with regard to extreme contrast, vistas and open space. 

f. 	
Uses within the proposed building. 

g. 	
Fire protection needs. 

C. 	
Special Conditions. 


1. 	
No PUD shall be approved unless the city council, after planning commission review and recommendation, is satisfied that the landowner has provided for 

or established an adequate organization for the ownership and maintenance of common open space and private roads, drives and parking which, in the opinion of the city council, is best calculated to ensure maintenance of such areas. 

2. 	
Lot area and coverage, setbacks and clustering.  In a multi-lot PUD, the averaging of lot areas shall be permitted to provide flexibility in design and to relate lot size to topography, but each lot shall contain an acceptable building site. The clustering of development with usable common open areas shall be permitted to encourage provision for and access to common open areas and to save street and utility construction and maintenance costs.  Such clustering is also intended to accommodate contemporary building types which are not spaced individually on their own lots but share common side walls, combined service facilities or similar architectural innovations, whether or not providing for separate ownership of land and buildings. 

3. 	
Maintenance provisions. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any time after approval of the planned unit development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition, the following procedures may be initiated by the city council: 


a. 	
The city council may serve written notice upon such organizations or upon the residents of the PUD setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition, and the notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof and shall state the time, date and place of a hearing thereon, which shall be held within fifteen (15) days of the date of notice. 

b. 	
At such hearing, the city council may modify the terms of the original notice as to deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. 

c. 	
If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice and in the modifications thereof are not cured within the period set, the City, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the PUD and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and maintain the same for a period of one (1) year.  Such entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space except when it is dedicated to the public by the owners. 

d. 	
Prior to the expiration of the year of city maintenance, the city council shall call a public hearing upon notice to the organization responsible for the maintenance of the open space, or to the residents of the planned unit development, at which hearing the organization or the residents shall show cause why such maintenance by the city shall not continue for the succeeding year. If the city council determines that the responsible organization is not ready and able to maintain the open space in a reasonable condition, the city, in its discretion, may continue to maintain the open space during the next succeeding year, 


and subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. 
e. 	The cost of maintenance by the city shall be paid by the owners of properties within the PUD that have a right of enjoyment of the open space, and any unpaid assessment shall become a tax lien in the office of the County Clerk and Recorder upon the properties affected by such lien to the city council and City Treasurer for collection, enforcement and remittance in the manner provided by law for the collection, enforcement and remittance of general property taxes. 
4. 	Consent of landowners required.  No PUD may be approved by the planning commission or city council without written consent or a letter of authorization of the landowner or landowners whose properties are included within the PUD. All owners of land within the proposed PUD shall sign each application form requesting consideration or approval of any PUD.

There is a change in the use of the building or land, which requires a change in the zoning district or a conditional use permit.  

4.
 There is a change in the occupancy of a building or the land, which requires a new sign, or other site improvements addressed in this article. 


B. Administration: Prior to issuance of a building permit, conditional use permit, or granting of a change in use in any zoning district for any property, the applicant shall demonstrate that the property will comply with the following applicable regulations: 
1. 	
All buildings, parking areas, landscaping, signs, and other improvements noted in the development standards in this title shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the approved plans prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building or use. 

2. 	
The Zoning Administrator may allow certain improvements to be constructed or installed within an agreed upon time allowing for seasonal changes.  Such arrangements may involve cashiers checks, performance bonds or other methods as deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator to assure eventual compliance with this title.  

3. 	
The Zoning Administrator may permit in a particular district a permitted principal use and a temporary use not listed in this title provided that such use is of the same general type as the uses permitted by this title. 


Chapter 17.32 Lot Area Regulations 
Section 17.320 General Lot Regulations 
A. 	Every building shall be located and maintained on a "lot" as defined in this title. 
B. No lot shall be divided to contain more dwellings than are permitted by the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
C. No space needed to meet the width, yard, area, open space, lot coverage, parking, or other requirements of this title for a lot or building may be sold, transferred, or leased away from such lot or building. 
D. No parcel of land which has less than the minimum width, depth and area requirements for the zoning district in which it is located may be divided from a larger parcel of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of building or development as a lot. 
E. Each lot or parcel in separate ownership shall have at least twenty-five (25) lineal feet of frontage on a public street or an access easement approved by the planning commission and city council unless otherwise provided for elsewhere in this title or  as part of an overall development plan.  
F. Each principal building devoted wholly or in part to residential use shall be located on a lot contiguous to a public street with permanent access to the public street sufficient to allow ingress and egress for emergency vehicles providing emergency services to the principal building. A principal building devoted wholly or in part to residential use that is located within an approved planned unit development, may be accessed by a private street, if the private street meets the same standards of public streets. 
G. No lot area, yard, open space, off-street parking or loading area which is required by this title for one (1) use shall be used to meet the required lot area, yard, open space, off-street parking or loading area of another use unless authorized by the Zoning Administrator and as provided under the parking regulations in Chapter 17.34. 
Section 17.322 Lot Area Requirements 
A. Basic Minimum Lot Area. Except as provided below, no lot shall be built upon unless containing at least the basic minimum lot requirements established in Article II.  
B. Nonconforming Lots of Record. Where an individual lot was held in separate ownership from adjoining properties or was platted prior to the effective date of this title in a recorded subdivision approved by the city council and has less area or width than required in other sections of this title, such lot may be occupied according to the permitted uses and other requirements set forth in the district in which the lot is located, provided that no lot area or lot width is reduced more than one-third (1/3) the zoning requirements otherwise specified by this title. If a nonconforming lot ever comes under the same ownership as a contiguous parcel it shall no longer be the same nonconforming lot and such cessation shall be recorded in the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder's Office, and then no portion of the enlarged parcel shall be sold unless both the portion to be sold and the remainder shall be conforming parcels.  
Section 17.324 Land Quality Limitations 
A. No structure can be built within one hundred  feet (100') of the one hundred (100) year flood plain. 
B. Exceptions may be granted upon the applicant providing a study of the land area and surrounding land that may be impacted by potential development.  The study shall be produced by a geo-technical engineer licensed in the State of Colorado.  Such study shall contain an analysis of potentially unstable slopes, faulting, or soil conditions, etc., that may be unfavorable to development.  The study shall also contain, where appropriate, recommendations for special mitigation measures and engineering precautions that shall be taken to overcome those limitations.   
C. Any development that is granted an exception to this regulation and is within the one hundred (100) year floodplain or within one hundred feet (100') of the floodplain, shall be designed so as not to cause any adverse effects to the development or to any other properties from either increased flood heights, flow velocities, flow duration, rate of rise of flood waters, channel stability or sediment transport; provided, however, that any development shall not be considered as causing an adverse effect to any other properties by reason of increased flood heights if such development does not cause a rise of more than one-tenth (1/10th) of a foot in the base flood elevation of the floodplain. 
Section 17.326 Land Dedications.  Land designated as flood plain management or open space through dedication or reservation for any reason shall be indicated as such on the appropriate zoning district map.  Such land and facilities shall be built and maintained either by a unit of government, by a nonprofit corporation or by private interests as part of a subdivision or development of land for use by the inhabitants or general public thereof; ownership of the land may be deeded or reserved to a property owner's association or it may be dedicated to the public; or as required by any condition for granting of a subdivision plat, zoning district or planned development amendment including designation of a park, trail or other open recreation use.  
Section 17.328 Setback Requirements. 
A. Transition. When a nonresidential use which is over fifteen feet (15') in height shares a common lot line with a residential use, the required side yard set back for the nonresidential use shall be at least twenty-five feet (25') and shall be maintained with landscaped plant material to include trees, shrubs, grasses and/or xeriscape plant material as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
B. 	Setback Requirements for Accessory Structures. 
1. 	
Accessory structures and uses shall be set back a minimum of twelve feet (12') from the rear lot line. 

2. 	
Accessory structures shall maintain the same side and front yard setbacks as required for the principal building located on the lot.  

3. 	
No part of any accessory structure shall be located closer than six feet (6') to any principal building, unless it is attached to or forms a part of such principal building. 

4.
 Accessory	 structures and uses shall otherwise comply with the bulk regulations applicable in the district in which they are located.  


C. Side Yards and Corner Lots. On corner lots, the side yard which is contiguous to a street shall not be less than ten feet (10') in width, except that a garage having perpendicular access to the street shall be set back at least eighteen  feet (18') from the street property line.  
D. Partially Developed Frontages.  When a vacant lot is bordered on two (2) sides by previously constructed buildings both of which do not meet the required front yard setback applicable to the district, the required front yard setback for the vacant lot shall be established as the average front yard setback of the two existing adjacent buildings. Where a vacant lot is bordered on only one side by a previously constructed building which does not meet the required front yard setback for the district, the required front yard setback for the vacant lot shall be established as the average front yard setback of the adjacent building and the minimum required front yard setback for the district. 
E. Irregular Shaped Lots. If a lot is not rectangular or square in shape, and a building is constructed so that one side of the building is parallel to an adjacent street or right-of-way, the setback between the building line and that lot line which is not parallel to the building line may be calculated as the average of the nearest and farthest distances between the building corners and the lot line, except that the minimum setback at any point shall not be less than five feet (5'). 
F. Features Allowed within Setbacks. The following structures and features may be located within required setbacks: 
1. 	
Trees, shrubbery or other features of natural growth. 

2. 	
Fences or walls, subject to permit approval that do not exceed the standards established in this article.

Unless otherwise required by the city engineer, all controlled intersections shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with such sight intersection distance provisions. Additionally, no landscaping, fence, utility equipment, wall or other structure in excess of thirty-six inches (36") in height above the roadway (or which intrudes into the sight triangle at a height of less than eighty-four inches or so as to obscure or block the visibility of any traffic control device or sign located at such intersection) shall be constructed or maintained in the area identified as the sight triangle, nor shall any parking be allowed within the area of the sight triangle. For purposes of this section a "controlled intersection" means an intersection equipped with a stop sign, yield sign, traffic control device, or other suitable traffic control warning sign. 
B. On corner lots located at uncontrolled intersections, no landscaping, fence, utility equipment, wall or other structure in excess of thirty-six inches (36") in height above the roadway (or which intrudes into the sight triangle at a height of less than eighty-four inches (84") or so as to obscure or block the visibility of any traffic control device or sign located at such intersection) shall be constructed or maintained within the triangular area bounded by intersecting property lines and a line connecting the point on each of the property lines which is twenty-five feet from the intersection of the property lines. Unless otherwise required by the city engineer or his or her designee, all uncontrolled intersections shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with such sight intersection distance provisions. For purposes of this section, an "uncontrolled intersection" means an intersection that is not equipped with a stop sign, yield sign, traffic control device or other suitable traffic control warning sign.

Chapter 17.41 Residential Cluster Development 
Section 17.410 Purpose and Intent 
A. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to permit an administratively uncomplicated method for cluster development, to promote imaginative, well-designed developments which preserve open space, respect physical qualities of the land and reduce overall development costs.  More specifically, this  option is intended to permit cluster development, which will: 
1. 	
Result in improved living and working environments. 

2. 	
Allow for flexibility in design and maximum effective density, in exchange for increased preservation of open space to serve recreational, 

scenic and public service purposes, within the densities established by the zoning district. 

3. 	
Promote more economically efficient development layout by reducing street lengths, utility installations, and energy savings in street and utility line maintenance. 

4. 	
Encourage ingenuity in design to promote a variety of housing types. 

5. 	
Establish criteria for identifying those parcels of land and/or sites, which are eligible for cluster design. 

6. 	
Insure that approval of residential cluster development is granted only if the subject parcel is large enough to make innovative and creative site planning possible. 

7. 	
Insure applicants for residential cluster development have professional capability to produce a creative plan. 

8. 	
Insure the public interest in achieving goals stated in the Fountain Comprehensive Development Plan will be better served by the residential cluster development than the application of conventional zoning regulations. 

9. 	
Insure that the advantages to land owners afforded by the residential cluster development will be balanced by public benefits. 

10. 
Insure that the dwelling units are concentrated on the most buildable portion of a parcel, so that natural drainage systems, open space, and other significant natural features that help control runoff and soil erosion are preserved. 


Section 17.411 Use and Density Requirements.  Every residential cluster development shall conform to the use and density requirements set forth in the underlying zoning district. In no case, shall the density specified for the underlying district increase, nor shall the other applicable regulations or use limitations be modified or changed. 
Section 17.412 Density Transfer.  In each zoning district allowing residential cluster development, the lot size may be reduced from the general lot size of the underlying zoning district, to a specific minimum lot size for cluster development. All such lot reductions shall be justified and compensated for by an equivalent amount of land in cluster open space to be reserved as permanent open space and maintained for its scenic value. 
Section 17.413 Dimensional Requirements 
A. Modification and variation of yard and lot dimensional requirements may be permitted. 
1. 	
Minimum Lot Area.  Lots may be reduced in areas below the minimum lot size required by the underlying zoning district, provided that the average lot size of the total lots created within the development is not below the minimum lot size required by the underlying zoning district.  Open space shall not be included in the total gross average used for determining the average lot size. 

2. 	
Yard Requirements. The minimum yard requirements established by the underlying zoning district may be reduced, upon finding by the planning 

commission and city council that the applicant has satisfactorily justified all requested yard modifications. Front yards shall have a minimum depth of eighteen feet (18'). Front yards shall be staggered to provide a maximum variety in the size of such yards. 

3.

3. 	
Phased Development. All proposed phased developments must be accompanied by a schedule establishing approximate dates when each phase will be completed.  Each phase of the development shall include its pro rata share of total planned common open space, facilities and services, as applicable. Amenities serving the entire development may be required to be constructed in the earliest phase of the development. 

4. 	
Provisions, Operation and Maintenance of Common Areas.  Where common areas or facilities are proposed, an operation and maintenance program shall be prepared, administered and enforced through approved covenants, conditions and restrictions. 

5. 	
Development Agreements. Completion time and complexity of proposed cluster developments may make desirable a development agreement between the project applicant and the city in order to provide assurance to the city that an approved project will proceed in accordance with the policies, rules and regulations existing at the time of the agreement and subject to conditions of approval. 

6. 	
Subdivision Plat Required. A request for residential cluster development must be accompanied by a subdivision plat, which meets the requirements set forth by the city. If land was subdivided prior to , it is exempt from meets and bounds requirements. 

7. 	
Denial of Application. If an application for a residential cluster development is denied, a substantially similar application, as determined by the planning commission and city council, cannot be submitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of denial. 


Section 17.415 Location.  Cluster development may occur in the LLR, RA, R1, MF and RMU residential zoning districts. 
Section 17.416 Open Space Lands.  The amount of open space required for a cluster development shall be equal to the amount that is equivalent to the total reduction in lot size for all lots in development.  Land reserved for open space shall be preserved and maintained for scenic value, recreation or conservation, schools, community buildings or related uses. Improvements shall be limited to such purposes. Cluster open space shall not include areas devoted to public or private vehicular streets or any land, which had been or is to be conveyed to a public agency via a purchase agreement (i.e. schools, parks or other public facilities). Cluster open space shall be made available to all residents unless the city finds that the area, configuration, and location of such open spaces would make public use undesirable or unnecessary. If dedicated to the city, the land shall be conveyed in fee simple absolute title by warranty deed. If the cluster open space is not dedicated to public use, it shall be protected by legal arrangements, satisfactory to the planning commission and city council, sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation for the purpose intended. Covenants or other legal arrangements shall specify the owner and maintenance responsibility.

variations to district regulations, which serve a public purpose, and provide amenities and benefits to an equivalent or higher degree than would ordinarily be achieved. 

5. 	
That the amenity level of the development and the amount of open space provided is greater than what would have been required under conventional zoning regulations. 

6. 	
That the usability of cluster open space intended for recreation or public use is easily accessible to pedestrians, and is suitable for the intended purposes. 

7. 	
That the residential cluster development creates a desirable and stable environment and makes possible an innovative and efficient use of the property. 

8. 	
That the proposed development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural scenic, or historic feature of significant importance to the community. 

9.

Chapter 17.43 Adult-oriented Uses – Regulated 
Section 17.432 Location Requirements
 A. Adult-oriented uses shall be established, operated and maintained only within the Planned Industrial District and shall be separated from the most proximate and directly measured             legally described property line of any residential zoning district, place of worship, park and/or school by not less than one thousand feet (1,000'), and other adult-oriented uses by not less                than three hundred feet (300'). 
B. Public streets, sidewalks, driveways, easements and other public rights-of-way shall be included in measuring the distances prescribed in this chapter. 
Section 17.434 Appeal Process 
A. The Zoning Administrator shall deny an application for any building permit or other approval necessary for the location or operation of an adult-oriented business upon a finding of noncompliance with the standards and requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require such issuance or approval of an adult oriented business failing to comply with the standards of the city, which may be otherwise generally applicable. Redress for any denial not made pursuant to this chapter shall be governed by the procedures otherwise available in the context of such denial. Within ten (10) business days of the city after the submission of an appropriate written application for the approval of the location of an adult-oriented business, the Zoning Administrator shall in writing approve or deny the same. In the event of denial, the Zoning Administrator shall in writing set forth the basis under this chapter of such denial. 
B. Within ten (10) calendar days from the date of such written denial, the applicant may file with the City Clerk a notice of appeal (pursuant to  Section 17.593)  stating with particularity the basis of the exception taken with such denial. A copy of such document shall be concurrently submitted to the office of the City Attorney. 
Section 17.436 Variance Procedures for Adult-Oriented Uses 
A. The City Council may grant a variance pursuant to a request for variance duly filed with the City Clerk upon a finding that, at the time of the filing of the request and continuing until the time of the hearing, no occupancy of any location is available to applicant for use as an adult-oriented business through acquisition by purchase or lease in a Planned Industrial Zoning District, as contemplated in this section.  For the purposes of this chapter, the applicant shall have the burden of proof to establish through diligent inquire, the unavailability of suitable property in compliance with the location requirements.  Economic hardship incurred in locating and maintaining such use incompliance with the location requirements shall not constitute the basis of establishing unavailability under this chapter. 
B. Upon receipt of the request for variance duly filed by the applicant for a variance, the city council shall schedule a public hearing in conformance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.61 of this title. 
C. In the event the city council should, in consideration of the evidence presented at the public hearing find that no location, as defined in this chapter, is available in a Planned Industrial Zoning District in compliance with the location requirements set forth in this section, the city council shall grant a variance to the applicant to locate the adult-oriented use within three hundred feet (300') of an existing adult-oriented use.  In the event that the applicant establishes that no location is available anywhere in a Planned Industrial Zoning District as required by this chapter, the city council shall grant a special variance to locate in an otherwise appropriately commercially zoned location specifically identified in the request for variance. Such property shall be situated no closer than one thousand feet (1000') from the property line of any existing residential use, church, school or park. 
D. Relief sought from the decision of the city council shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 106 (a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Failure to request and exhaust the administrative procedure provided in this chapter shall preclude judicial review, and shall be deemed to constitute an abandonment of any right or claim to a variance under this section. 
E. Notice. Any notice to be given to the city by the applicant, or to the applicant by the city under this chapter, shall be effective upon the mailing thereof to the attention of the Zoning Administrator, and to the applicant at the address set forth in any notice or request presented under this title. 
Chapter 17.44 Telecommunications and Antennae 
Section 17.440 Design Standards for CMRS Telecommunications Sites 
A. All CMRS telecommunications sites are subject to a design review process and fees as specified by the city council. The review process varies according to the type of facility proposed and the zoning district in which the facility is located.  The purpose of design review for CMRS telecommunications sites is to ensure that the necessary antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters are sited and screened in a way that minimizes visual and physical impacts on the surrounding area.  The following design criteria and requirements shall apply to all CMRS telecommunication antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters: 
1.
 All CMRS telecommunications antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters shall be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings and existing or planned uses in the area.  This may be accomplished with compatible architectural elements such as color, texture, scale, and character. 

2.
 Siting and installation of CMRS telecommunications antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters shall preserve or enhance the existing character of the topography and vegetation of a site. Existing vegetation, if any, and if suitable with natural features, shall be preserved and/or improved to provide screening for the facility. If existing topography of the site does not adequately screen equipment from view, fencing may be required. Fencing should not be used exclusively but instead be supplemented with vegetation. Any security fencing shall be of a design that blends into the character of the existing environment and meet the height limitation for the zoning district in which the fencing is located. 

3. 	
All CMRS antennae and equipment shall be no taller than necessary for the efficient operation of the CMRS antennae and equipment. 

4. 	
Applicants shall demonstrate that the CMRS telecommunications site is a necessary component of the applicant's overall communication network and communication plan for the community.  Such demonstration shall require that the applicant establish at least one of the following criteria: (1) the site is necessary to provide appropriate signal coverage quality; (2) the site is made necessary pursuant to the applicant's FCC license; and (3) the site is necessary to handle increased capacity due to caller volume.  In addition, the applicant shall demonstrate: (1) existing topography and/or structures in the surrounding area preclude other locations in the same area and (2) technical and engineering factors require the site to be in the desired location in relation to other existing sites and system constraints such as frequency requirements, availability of electric power and interconnection to telephone land lines, and site access. 

5. 	
All CMRS telecommunications antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters shall be sited, designed, and screened to minimize the visibility of such equipment from surrounding properties, public streets and neighborhoods. 

6. 	
The colors of all CMRS telecommunication antennae, equipment, and equipment shelters shall minimize the visibility of the facility. 

7. 	
To minimize the visual and physical impact on the surrounding area caused by freestanding and building mounted CMRS telecommunications facilities, the city encourages innovative and multiple use of building and structures for the location of CMRS telecommunications facilities, antenna, and equipment. 


Section 17.442 Design Standards for Structure or Building Mounted CMRS Telecommunications Facilities 
A. All structure or building mounted CMRS antennae and equipment shall be designed and constructed to blend with and enhance the architectural characteristics of the accompanying building or structure. 
1. 	Panel Antennae Standards: 
a. 	
Panel antennae shall not protrude horizontally more than two feet (2') from the building wall and shall be painted or treated to match the building or structure to which the panel is attached. 

b. 	
Panel antennae attached to the side of a building shall not exceed the height of the parapet or the roofline, whichever is greater. 

c. 	
Panel antennae mounted on an existing penthouse or existing rooftop mounted service equipment for the building shall not exceed the height of the penthouse or service equipment to which the antennae is attached. 

d. 	
Panel antennae shall not be mounted in a freestanding, sled, or rack-mounted fashion on the top of a building unless: (1) there exists unscreened service equipment on the roof, which will be screened from view along with the panel antennae. (2) the screening of the antennae and equipment will be architecturally compatible with the building. (3) a waiver is obtained from the Zoning Administrator. The construction of artificial penthouses or artificial service equipment on a roof for attaching CMRS telecommunication facilities is prohibited. 

e. 	
No panel antenna shall exceed the maximum height limitation for the zoning district in which the panel is located. 


2. Whip Antennae Standards 
a. 	
Single whip antennas shall not extend more than fifteen feet (15') above the building height. 

b. 	
Where more than one whip antenna is attached to one building, such antennae shall maintain a minimum separation of fifteen feet (15') between antennas owned by different CMRS telecommunication providers. 

c. 	
No whip antenna shall exceed the maximum height limitation for the zoning district in which the antenna is located. 


Section 17.444 Design and Performance Standards for Freestanding CMRS Telecommunications Facilities 
A. The following design and performance standards shall apply to all freestanding CMRS telecommunication facilities: 
1. 	
The height of any freestanding CMRS communication facility shall conform to the height limit of the zoning district in which the facility is located. 

2. 	
All freestanding CMRS telecommunications facilities shall meet the landscaping requirements set forth in this title, including screening of such facilities with vegetation.  As a condition of approval of any freestanding CMRS telecommunication facility, the city may require the applicant to provide a performance bond or other surety to the city which is adequate to ensure the completion of all planned and required landscaping and screening associated with the approved CMRS telecommunication facility.  Where the CMRS telecommunications facility is located on a parcel of land that is leased by the applicant and which is part of a larger parcel of land under single ownership, reasonable landscaping improvements in accordance with this title may be required within the larger unleased parcel where such improvements will bring the facility into conformance with the requirements of this chapter, mitigate the impacts of the telecommunication facility, or enhance the visual qualities and aesthetics of the larger parcel. 

3. 	
A freestanding CMRS telecommunications facility shall not be located closer than one thousand feet (1,000') from any other freestanding CMRS telecommunications facility established or proposed by the same or another provider unless a waiver from this requirement is obtained from the city council, after planning commission review and recommendation.  Co-location of CMRS telecommunication facilities on the same freestanding facility is therefore strongly encouraged. No facility owner, lessee, or employee thereof shall act to exclude or attempt to exclude any other provider from the same location. A service provider, lessee, or employee thereof shall cooperate in good faith to achieve co- location or antennae with other providers.  Should co-location not be acceptable to existing providers, the service provider wanting to locate on the existing facility shall be required to prove to the satisfaction of the city that co-location is not feasible. 


B. To obtain a waiver from the requirements of this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate: (1) the site is necessary to provide appropriate signal coverage quality; (2) the site is made necessary pursuant to the applicant's FCC license; (3) the site is necessary to handle increased capacity due to caller volume; (4) existing topography and/or structures in the surrounding area preclude other locations in the same area;  (5) technical and engineering factors require the site to be in the desired location in relation to other existing sites and system constraints such as frequency requirements, availability of electric power and interconnection to telephone land lines, and site access; and (6) screening and design of the freestanding facility will make the site compatible with surrounding land uses. 
Section 17.446 Design and Performance Standards for CMRS Telecommunications Equipment 
A. Equipment Shelters. All CMRS telecommunications equipment shelters shall be screened so they are not visible from any adjacent public streets or public areas.  
1. 	Equipment Shelters Associated with Structure or Building Mounted CMRS Antennae. Shelters associated with roof or building mounted antennae are encouraged to be located in one of the following areas, which are listed in order of preference from most (a) to least (g) preferred: 
a. 	
Inside the building or structure to which the panel or whip antennae are attached. 

d. 	
Inside an existing equipment penthouse on the roof of a building whenever possible. 

e. 	
Immediately adjacent to the exterior of an existing equipment or elevator penthouse if the shelter can be visually incorporated into the penthouse structure by the use of screening of similar style and color to the penthouse. 

f. 	
If no penthouse exists, consideration may be given to the creation of a penthouse, or a screen which is deemed architecturally compatible with the associated building by the Zoning Administrator, that screens both the equipment shelter and the existing service equipment associated with the building such as heating and air-conditioning equipment. 

g. 	
Outside of a penthouse on the roof of a building if a parapet exists that is taller than the CMRS equipment shelter.  If the parapet is not taller than the CMRS equipment shelter, consideration will be given to increase the height of the parapet provided that the building materials used are the same as those existing and if the design of the parapet is found acceptable to city standards and the parapet extension is architecturally compatible with the building. 

h. 	
Painted or treated the same color and located in such a manner that an additional protrusion is not created on the roof. 

i. 	
On the ground and screened according to the design criteria for CMRS telecommunications facilities. 


2. Freestanding CMRS Equipment Shelters.	  CMRS telecommunications equipment shelters whether or not associated with freestanding CMRS shall: 
a. 	
Be located in an enclosed building that is architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment. 

b. 	
Be screened completely with an architecturally compatible wall or fence so the shelter is not visible from adjacent properties, streets or public areas. 

c. 	
In addition, all CMRS telecommunications equipment shelters associated with freestanding CMRS telecommunications facilities shall: 

i.
 Have enclosed buildings, walls, or fencing, the appearance of which is enhanced by vegetation. 


ii. 	Be grouped as closely as technically possible to each other and the freestanding facility. 
iii. 	Cover a surface area not to exceed four hundred and fifty 
(450) square feet per provider. 
iv. 	
Use designs, materials, and colors compatible with structures and vegetation on the same parcel and adjacent parcels. 

v. 	
Not reduce the parking or landscaped areas below the minimum district requirements for other principal uses on the parcel. 


Section 17.448 Approval Procedures for  CMRS Telecommunications Facilities in Specific Zoning Districts 
A.  CMRS telecommunications facilities shall be reviewed as follows: 
Review of CMRS Telecommunications Facilities 
Zoning District  STRUCTURE OR BUILDING MOUNTED FACILITY  FREESTANDING FACILITY  
All residential zoning districts  Zoning Administrator  Planning commission and city council   
All nonresidential districts  Zoning Administrator  Planning commission only  

1. 	
Structure or building mounted telecommunication facilities are permitted on nonresidential structures within residential districts and also permitted on multi-family residential buildings provided that the antenna and equipment are located no closer to a dwelling unit than the distance deemed safe or appropriate by the Federal Communication Commission or other appropriate federal regulatory agency for radio frequency radiation or emissions. 

2. 	
Any freestanding CMRS telecommunications facilities shall be entirely enclosed within an attached architectural element of a building or structure that is compatible in design, color, and materials with the adjacent uses to the CMRS telecommunications site. 


Chapter 17.45 Animal Raising and Keeping 
Section 17.450 General Provisions 
A. Location Requirements. The housing, keeping, or sheltering of any animal or livestock, excluding household pets, shall be allowed in the LLR, RA, POS, and PUD Zoning Districts only. Animals shall be limited to domestic livestock, farm animals and fowl as listed below. Other similar animals are allowed, however, the Zoning Administrator shall designate an animal unit ratio for similar animals using the Stockman's Handbook or similar reliable source.  
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to limit under specific circumstances the number of animals allowed and the methods by which animals are kept on private property. It is the intent of this chapter to minimize potential adverse impacts on adjoining properties, the neighborhood and persons in the vicinity from improper management of such animals.

Section 17.596 Standard of Review for Variance Requests 
A. For any requests for variance pursuant to Chapter 17.594,  the board of adjustment may, after public hearing, modify the application of the regulations or provisions of this title relating to the construction, or alteration of buildings or structures if it finds that all of the following exist: 
1. 	
Due to exceptional and extraordinary circumstances unique to the property or structure for which the variance is sought, the strict enforcement of the provisions of this title would cause an unnecessary hardship to the applicant. 

2. 	
The circumstances causing the unnecessary hardship were not created by an owner or user of the property or by the applicant for the variance.   

3. 	
The hardship is not established based on lack of knowledge of the restrictions upon constructing or altering a structure; nor by the purchasing of a property without knowledge of applicable restrictions; nor by showing, that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. 

4. 	
The circumstances causing the unnecessary hardship are particular to the land or structure for which the variance is sought and do not apply generally to land and buildings in the zoning district in which the property is located. 

5. 	
The variance requested is the minimum deviation from the title necessary to allow the same and no greater use as that allowed of other land or structures in the same zoning district. 

6. 	
The granting of the variance will not injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming properties, will not impair an adequate supply of light and air, will not impair the view from the adjacent property, and will not substantially diminish or impair property values within the surrounding area. 

7. 	
The granting of the variance will be consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this title and will not create a situation, which alters the character of the area surrounding the property for which the variance is granted. 

8. 	
The granting of the variance will secure and in no way diminish the public safety and welfare; not impair prevention of or increase risk of fire, flood, traffic congestion or other hazard. 

9. 	
The granting of the variance is necessary to cause substantial justice to be done. 

10. 
The granting of the variance will not allow uses or densities not permitted in the zoning district in which it is granted nor shall the variance allow the expansion or establishment of a nonconforming use.   


B. 	In granting a variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies and may impose such conditions on the use of the property for which the variance is sought as are consistent with the purposes of this title. If such safeguards or conditions are imposed, the variance shall not become effective until the owner of the property and the applicant agree to abide by such conditions. 
Section 17.597 Not Transferable.  Each variance shall apply specifically to the property or structure described in the approval and shall not be transferable to any other property or structure. 
Section 17.598 Duration. 
A. Unless limited by its terms, a variance shall remain in full force and effect as long as the use for which the variance is sought continues.  However, failure to apply for a building permit to carry out the work involved in the variance, within one (1) year from the date the variance was granted, shall constitute abandonment of the variance.   
B. Discontinuance of the use for which the variance was granted for a period of one (1) year or more shall constitute abandonment of the variance.  Upon abandonment, the variance shall automatically cease to exist with no further action by the board of adjustment.

Moreover, if the addition, enlargement, or change in use increases the building or the developed area of the use, or the required parking by twenty percent (20%) or more in a nonresidential district or thirty percent (30%) or more in a residential district, then parking for the entire building shall be brought into conformance with all requirements of this title, including required number of spaces, access, landscaping, lighting, screening, and other applicable standards.
