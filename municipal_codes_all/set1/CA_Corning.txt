PREFACE 
    The Corning, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1978, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of C.A. Stromsness, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 674, passed June 12, 2018.

I. HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

The City Council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the City Council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the City to the difference between the low bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. 
G.  Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the purchasing officer and shall be identified as bids on the envelope.

The City Council is the administrative body vested with complete authority to make final decisions with respect to the foregoing matters. 
J.  Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening. 
K.  Security for Contracts.

(Ord. No. 648, § 2, 11-22-2011) 
3.12.082 - Exceptions from purchasing procedures. 
A.  The procedures set forth above may be dispensed with only when: 
1.  An emergency requires that the purchase be made immediately; 
2.  The product or services being sought are of such a unique nature that they are reasonably available from only a single source; 
3.  The services being sought are of a professional or other nature where factors other than price are considered significant; 
4.  The product or services being sought have already been put out to bid by the state or another public entity and the city may utilize the benefits of that process to obtain a competitive price; 
5.  The product being sought is a used or surplus product and it would be extremely difficult to seek competitive bids for something which is similar in nature. 
6.  The City Council determines that the supplies or equipment being sought should not go out to formal bid because the City's needs will be better met by soliciting prices from several different vendors, negotiating prices from a single vendor or following other procedures designed to expeditiously acquire what the City needs at a reasonable price. This exception to the formal bidding requirement recognizes that the lowest price available is a very important consideration but that it should not be the sole consideration when the City is also seeking the best quality product which most closely meets the City's needs. When this exception is applied, it shall only be done by the City Council and the final price, however it has been arrived at, shall only become a binding commitment of the City when the City Council approves it and authorizes the purchase to take place. 
B.  The purchasing officer shall not have authority to invoke any of the foregoing exceptions to purchasing procedures when services rather than supplies and/or equipment are the subject of the purchase. 
C.  When the purchasing officer or the city council authorizes a purchase using one or more of the foregoing exceptions from the regular purchasing procedures, the vendor to be used and the price to be paid should be thoroughly researched and aggressively negotiated so that the product or services being obtained are in the best interests of the city. 
(Ord. 583 §1k, 1999). 
(Ord. No. 648, § 2, 11-22-2011)

In case such determination is made, the finance director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the finance director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing on the amount assessed is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the finance director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the finance director shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the finance director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in themanner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in Section 3.28.090 of this chapter for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the finance director. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the finance director that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section; but only when the tax was paid to the finance director, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the finance director that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

Chapter 5.40 - YARD SALES 
Sections: 

5.40.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that it is a common practice for persons residing in the city to conduct yard sales, as they are defined in this chapter, and that some such sales are in fact commercial enterprises which are carried on without business licenses and in areas not zoned for commercial enterprises. Because such sales are not regulated, and may be used for the disposition of property illicitly obtained, it is deemed necessary to regulate such sales. 
(Ord. 326 §1, 1979). 
5.40.020 - Defined. 
    As used in this chapter, "yard sale" means a sale by an individual or group of individuals of items of personal property, conducted at a place of residence, as an occasional sale and not on a regular basis. The term is synonymous with the term "garage sale." Yard sale, as used in this chapter, shall not include a rummage sale, conducted by a bona fide, nonprofit organization, conducted at any public building, church, or building in a commercial zone. 
(Ord. 326 §§2, 8, 1979). 
5.40.030 - Requirements. 
    One or more persons may join together in conducting a yard sale, and conduct such sales more than once each year, if such persons have obtained a business license from the city and have paid the fee provided by Section 5.20.420, and further provided, that such sale is not conducted in any R zone in the city. Sales shall begin no sooner than eight a.m. of any day, and shall end at sunset of a sale day. 
(Ord. 326 §4, 1979). 
5.40.040 - Permit-Required. 
    No yard sale shall be conducted by any person or persons in the city without first having obtained a permit from the city to conduct such sale. 
(Ord. 326 §6, 1979). 
5.40.050 - Permit-Application. 
    An application to hold a yard sale shall be made to the city clerk not less than seven days prior to the first day of such sale.

Such permit shall be granted by the city clerk without fee, provided the applicant or applicants, or any of them, have not conducted a yard sale in the city within the year preceding the application for a permit. The applicants shall further agree in the application to permit an inspection of the personal property being sold by any peace officer, such inspection to take place during the hours of sale.

If the officer determines that the dog is dangerous, no further administrative enforcement action shall occur until twenty days have elapsed following the decision, except that impoundment of the dog under Section 6.16.250 may be continued until a determination becomes final and disposition of the dog is resolved. If legal proceedings challenging the decision are instituted and a summons is served before twenty days have elapsed, then administrative enforcement shall be suspended pending a final determination by the courts.

If there is a prosecution and conviction under Sections 6.l6.l96A, 6.16.196B, 6.l6.260A or 6.16.260B, then such conviction shall conclusively establish that the minimum conditions of maintenance and control of the dangerous dog have been violated. If there is a final determination, either by administrative hearing or by court conviction as set forth above, that any of the conditions of maintaining or controlling a dangerous dog have been violated, then after the time for appeal has elapsed the officer has discretion to either release the dog to its owner or custodian on such terms and conditions as the officer may specify to protect the public safety and welfare or order that the dangerous dog be humanely destroyed. 
G.  If pursuant to subsection F of this section the officer orders that the dangerous dog be destroyed, and the dog has not been impounded under Section 6.16.250, then the owner or custodian of the dog shall comply within thirty days by either (1) delivering the dog to the animal control officer for destruction, or (2) having the dog humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian.

    It is important for the city to be and to appear clean, well kept and generally clear of public nuisance, eyesores and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating in a particular area. A clean community can increase property values, provide a healthy environment and make citizens proud of the area they live in, which acts as its own encouragement to keep the community clean in the future. As such a community needs to develop a plan and a set of regulations to keep the area cleaned up, to remove unsightly conditions and prevent future problems from occurring. The following program has been designated to meet these needs, and protect the citizens health, safety and property values from public nuisances.

Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions or perform any duty imposed by this chapter or other applicable law, the code enforcement officer is authorized to enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty imposed upon the code enforcement officer by this chapter or by the other applicable law; provided, that if such property is occupied the code enforcement officer must present proper credentials to the occupant and request entry, explaining the reason therefor. If such property is unoccupied, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the property and request entry, explaining the reasons therefor. If such entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the owner or other person having charge or control of the property cannot be found after due diligence, the code enforcement officer shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the code enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that there is an accumulation of refuse or litter, or both, or other unsanitary conditions prohibited by this chapter on the premises which could be seriously detrimental to the public health or safety, the city shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect such property. If such entry is refused, the code enforcement officer shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.

A.  Each code officer is authorized to issue citations for violations of the provision of Titles 8, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of this code which they have the duty to enforce. The code enforcement officer will notify the alleged violator that a public nuisance exists and, if the public nuisance has not been abated within what he or she deems a reasonable period of time, he or she may then issue a criminal citation to the alleged violator. Although not mandatory, in most cases the code enforcement officer should warn the alleged violator that a citation will be issued if voluntary compliance is not achieved within a specified time period. Proof that notice of a violation (or the existence of a public nuisance) has been given to an alleged violator is not a prerequisite to a finding that a violation has occurred, nor is it a requirement which must be satisfied before a citation may be issued or a conviction obtained. The form of the citation issued pursuant to this chapter shall be approved by the city council and the district attorney. 
B.  Prior to issuance of a citation: 
1.  The code enforcement officer shall identify himself or herself; 
2.  Identify the violation; 
3.  Shall then request the alleged violator to present his or her driver's license or other satisfactory evidence of his or her identity for examination;

8.25.090 - Money judgments. 
    Any judgment of conviction which imposes a fine shall become a money judgment, as provided by Penal Code Section 1214. It shall be the responsibility of the code enforcement officer to determine if the fine imposed has been paid. In any case where the fine remains unpaid for more than thirty days, a code enforcement officer shall record an abstract of the judgment in the office of the county recorder, as provided by Code of Civil Procedure Sections 674 and 697.310.

Chapter 9.20 - SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESS OR CONTRIBUTIONS OF MONEY OR OTHER PROPERTY 

9.20.010 - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council makes the following findings: 
A.  On city streets, sidewalks and intersections, the activity of soliciting employment, business or contributions from occupants of vehicles is hazardous because it distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and be alert for potential hazards in the roadway, to observe all traffic control signals, signs or warnings, and to be prepared to move through the city's streets and intersections. 
B.  In public and private parking lots and parking structures, the activity of soliciting employment, business, or contributions from occupants of vehicles is hazardous because it distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch other vehicles or pedestrians and to move through the lot or structure with safety. 
C.  The practice of soliciting employment, business or contributions from within a public street, highway, or parking facility subjects the solicitor, pedestrians and vehicles to an unacceptable level of danger by distracting drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and results in the delay and obstruction of the public's free flow of travel, and results in congestion and blockage of the streets, parking lot driveways, and sidewalks when such persons approach the vehicles to negotiate with the occupants. 
D.  Distracted drivers are more prone to be involved in automobile accidents; and accidents on the public streets constitute a substantial traffic safety problem. 
E.  The cumulative impact of this type of activity on the streets, highways, sidewalks and parking facilities on a daily basis creates a potential safety hazard, which poses a significant and substantial risk to the interest of the public in the free flow of travel. 
F.  Solicitation within parking lots and structures is of particular concern, because it presents a potentially threatening environment for people traveling to or from their vehicle and provides a greater opportunity for someone desiring to conceal his or her presence from the unsuspecting. 
G.  People exiting or entering a vehicle are in a very vulnerable position when approached by a solicitor and are exposed to reasonable fear for safety and the possibility of a carjacking, robbery or other person or property crime. 
H.  Soliciting in a manner that is confrontational and involves conduct that is perceived by the person being solicited as harassing, coercing, or intimidating or which obstructs the free passage of that individual is detrimental to the quality of life and economic vitality of the community. 
I.  Soliciting at times and places where individuals feel particularly vulnerable, such as during times of darkness, or in the vicinity of automatic teller machines, causes the person being solicited to feel unsafe, which in turn leads to people who would be engaged in legitimate activities tending to avoid certain areas, resulting in a decline in business and community life and a possible increase in crime. 
(Ord. No. 638, § 1, 10-27-2009) 
9.20.020 - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall be construed as defined in this section: 
    "Aggressive manner" means approaching or speaking to a person, or following a person before, during or after soliciting if that conduct is intended or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm to oneself or to another, or damage to or loss of property or otherwise feel threatened; continuing to solicit from a person after the person has given a negative response to such soliciting; intentionally touching or causing physical contact with another person without that person's consent in the course of soliciting; intentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle in conjunction with soliciting; or using violent or threatening gestures or language in conjunction with the solicitation. 
    "Business" means any type of product, good, service performance or activity which is provided or performed, or offered to be provided or performed, in exchange for money, labor, goods or any other form of consideration. 
    "Commercial parking area" means privately owned property which is designed or used primarily for the parking of vehicles and which adjoins one or more commercial establishments. 
    "Employment" means services, industry or labor performed by a person for wages or other compensation or under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied. 
    "Median strip" means a paved or planted area of public right-of-way dividing a street or highway into lanes according to the direction of travel. 
    "Public right-of-way" means land which is dedicated to the public use for sidewalk, street or highway purposes, or other transportation purposes. 
    "Solicit" means making any oral or written request, offer or enticement, or taking any action which indicates the availability of a person for employment or availability to provide services for compensation or which seeks to purchase or secure services or goods, the purchase or sale of goods, or a request for money or other property, or a contribution of money or other property.

C.  It is unlawful for any person to solicit or attempt to solicit, employment, business or contributions of money or other property from any occupant of a vehicle, or from any person getting into or out of a vehicle within any public parking lot or structure where such parking lot or structure is posted with a sign prohibiting such activity.

Chapter 9.21 - BUTANE RESALE ORDINANCE 

9.21.010 - Authority and title. 
    Under the authority granted in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution and Government Code §§ 36900 and 36901, the City of Corning, by and through its Council, does enact this chapter of its Municipal Code, which shall be known as the butane resale ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 666, § 1, 4-12-2016) 
9.21.020 - Findings and purpose. 
    The northern region of our state has experienced a recent increase in explosions caused from the manufacture of honey oil (also known as hash oil) in clandestine labs using refined butane. These incidents have caused considerable property damage, personal injury and even incidents of death to those participating in the manufacturing process, and to innocent bystanders. 
    Refined butane is used to dissolve the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) resin, which concentrates into a liquid/oil form as a result of the butane's stripping process. The stripping of the THC through use of refined butane causes flammable butane vapors to accumulate low to the ground and remain exposed to ignition sources. Studies suggest that ninety-nine and one-half percent of the extracted THC butane mixture will volatilize into the immediate area and find an ignition source. 
    That the honey oil lab using refined butane presents a serious hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by a combustible gas instrument. Such conditions present grave risk of loss where devices such as a Taser are capable of igniting the gas resulting in an explosion. 
    That the resale of refined butane occurs at levels sufficient to aid the manufacture of honey oil. That such sales and possession of butane should be regulated to prevent the use of butane in the manufacture of honey oil where such activity presents grave dangers to the occupants of the City of Corning and the first responders therein. 
(Ord. No. 666, § 1, 4-12-2016)

E.  It is unlawful for a reseller to sell to a customer more than eight hundred forty milliliters of butane during a consecutive thirty-day period. 
(Ord. No. 666, § 1, 4-12-2016)

Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 541 (part), 1993). 
13.04.475 - Affirmative defenses to discharge viola-tions. 
A.  Upset. 
1.  For the purpose of this section "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment stan-dards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack or preventive maintenance, or careless or improper opera-tion. 
2.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (A)(3) of this section are met. 
3.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information if provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days). 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreat-ment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
B.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's pretreatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the pretreatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or sub-stantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (B)(3) and (4) of this section. 
3.  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the di-rector of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the an-ticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four hours. 
4.  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
iii.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (B)(3) of this section. 
b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the di-rector determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (B)(4)(a). 
(Ord. 541 (part), 1993). 
13.04.476 - Validity. 
    If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, no other provision of this chapter will be affected thereby. 
(Ord. 541 (part), 1993).

A.  Cross-connection Control Required. It shall be the responsibility of the public works department of the city of Corning to protect the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow or back-siphonage of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the director of public works or a designated agent, an approved backflow-prevention device is required at the city's water service connection to any customer's premises, for the safety of the city water system, the director or designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved device at each service connection to their premises. The customer shall immediately install such device, at their expense. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install such device shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device has been properly installed. 
B.  Approved Standards for Cross-connection Control Devices and Systems. 
1.  Any backflow-prevention device required by this code shall be a model and size approved by the public works director. The term "approved backflow-prevention device" means a device that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association (A.W.W.A.), entitled "A.W.W.A. C506-78 Standards for Reduced Pressure and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices"; and which has met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California, and Specifications of Backflow Prevention Devices (#69-2) or the most current issue. 
2.  Said A.W.W.A. and F.C.C.C. and H.R. standards and specifications have been adopted by the city of Corning by resolution. The public works department shall maintain a current list of approved devices. 
3.  As a protection to the customer's plumbing system, a suitable pressure-relief valve shall be installed and maintained at the customer's expense. The relief valve shall be installed between the backflow-prevention device and the customer's water heater. 
4.  In special cases, the city may require the customer to eliminate certain plumbing or piping connections as an additional precaution to prevent backflow. 
C.  Approval of Public Works Director Required. Prior to the installation of any such devices, the customer shall submit to the public works director a statement containing the make and model of the device, and location and method of installation of such device for approval. Failure to do so could result in the installation of a nonapproved device. 
D.  Annual Inspection of Cross-connection Control Devices Required. 
1.  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where said devices have been installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once a year. If in the opinion of the director or his designated agent a hazard is great enough, he may require a certified inspection at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be done at the customer's expense and shall be performed by the device manufacturer's representative, by the city's utility personnel, or a certified tester approved by the city. 
2.  It shall be the duty of the public works depart-ment to insure that these timely tests are made. The customer shall notify the city in advance of these tests so that a representative may witness the tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced whenever said devices are found to be defective at the customer's expense. Records of such tests, repairs or replacement shall be kept and made available to the city. 
3.  When a customer-user fails to complete the annual testing and/or repairs in a timely manner, the director of public works is hereby authorized to order said testing and repairs be completed by a certified tester and/or appropriately qualified repair firm. The costs incurred for the testing and /or repairs of the backflow prevention device(s) shall be the responsibility of the customer user, and may be assigned and collected as part of the water service billing. 
(Ord. 443 §2, 1986). 
(Ord. No. 644, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-2011) 
13.08.180 - Meters-Foreign water use-Generally. 
    All foreign water used within the city, and in any way discharging into the sewage collection system, shall be metered by water meters of a type or brand approved by the city. The cost of the meter and of installing the same, including all costs relating thereto, shall be borne by the property owner. The meter shall be sealed by the city and maintained by it as is the normal meter, and shall be owned by the city. Hereafter all such meters shall be installed by the city. Sewage service charges for such foreign waters discharge into the sewage collection system shall be billed in accordance with established rules, regulations and ordinances governing the sewage collection system. Any failure to establish the necessary valves and the required meter within sixty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall result in the city turning off the water to the premises from the city distribution system. 
(Ord. 111 §17, 1953). 
13.08.190 - Equipment-Inspection and repair. 
    For the purpose of conserving the water supply and protecting the public interest and health, no leaky or defective plumbing, water pipes, hydrants, or other fixtures shall be used in connection with such water consumption. For the purpose of carrying out this provision, the water superintendent shall, at all reasonable hours of the day, have the right to inspect all such property, water pipes, hydrants and fixtures; and if any are found to be leaky or defective to an extent sufficient to be wasteful, then he shall notify such owner or the occupant of the premises to cause the same to be properly repaired within three days. If such repairs are not so made within three days, he shall have the right to cut off the water supply until such time as the repairs are properly made and a charge shall be made for again turning on the water. This section shall apply to the undue or excessive use of water in aircooling systems. The charge to be made shall be as fixed by resolution.

In the event of a violation of any term of this chapter, or any rule or regulation or resolution established pursuant to this chapter, the water superintendent shall notify in writing the person or persons causing, allowing or committing such violation, specifying the violation and the time after which (upon the failure of such person or persons to prevent or rectify the violation) the water superintendent will exercise his authority to disconnect the property served by the city; provided, that such time shall not be less than five days after the deposit of such notice in the United States Post Office at Corning, California, addressed to the person or persons to whom notice is given; provided, however, that in the event such violation results in a public hazard or menace, then the water superintendent may enter upon the premises without notice and do such things and expend such sums as may be necessary to abate such hazard, and the reasonable value of the things done and amounts expended in so doing shall be a charge upon the owner so in violation. 
C.  Right of Entry for Inspection. An authorized employee of the city shall have reasonable access to any premises supplied with water for the purpose of making inspections for cross-connection control, inspections of the water system and water meters upon such premises. Any person who, as owner or occupant of any premises, refuses admittance to or hinders or prevents inspection by an authorized employee of the city, may have all water shut off, after service of twenty-four hours notice of the inspection of the city to do so. 
D.  All enforcement of violations shall be in conformance with California Public Utilities Code Section 10001 et seq., insofar as they may conflict with city ordinances. 
(Ord. 443 §3, 1986; Ord. 111 §21, 1953). 
13.08.230 - Drilling of new wells prohibited. 
    No person or other entity shall drill for water within the city limits of the city of Corning without first obtaining a permit therefor from the person designated as the water superintendent of the city. The water superintendent of the city shall deny the issuance of the permit if, in his or her opinion, the premises where the well is to be located can reasonably be served by the municipal water system. If municipal water services are located within two hundred feet of any property line of the premises, it is presumed that the premises can "reasonably be served" by the municipal water system, notwithstanding the cost to be borne by the private party in having such services extended. 
    The water superintendent of the city shall only grant such a permit when he or she determines that the premises cannot reasonably be served by municipal water services and further determines that the proposed well will not contaminate existing water sources or constitute a health hazard to the community. 
    When a permit is granted, it shall only continue to be valid as long as the well does not provide a source of contamination or become a health hazard and only until such time as municipal water services are extended to a location within two hundred feet of any property line of the premises. Whenever any of the foregoing circumstances occur, the permit shall automatically expire and the owner of the property where such well is located shall immediately be obligated, at his or her sole expense, to abandon the well and connect to the municipal water system after paying all applicable charges. 
    Any decision made by the water superintendent of the city concerning such a permit may be appealed to the city council by filing a notice of appeal, in writing, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 13.08.210 of this code. 
(Ord. 585 §1 (part), 2001). 
13.08.240 - Exception for new agricultural wells on large parcels. 
    The drilling of wells designed strictly for agricultural purposes rather than for production of water for human consumption also requires a permit from the city. The term "agricultural" in this chapter means the growing of crops or the raising of livestock regardless of the zoning designation of the land. The water superintendent of the city shall grant a permit for this type of well when (1) the applicant signs a certification, which shall become a covenant running with the land upon recordation in the Tehama County Recorder's Office, assuring the city that the water from such well will be used strictly for agricultural purposes; (2) the applicant grants, as a part of the same certification, continuing permission for the city to enter upon his or her property to inspect such well and all connections thereto; (3) the water superintendent determines that the proposed well will not contaminate existing water sources or constitute a health hazard to the community; and (4) the parcel on which the well is proposed to be placed is at least five acres in size. 
(Ord. 585 §1 (part), 2001). 
13.08.250 - Abandonment of existing wells. 
    Any property owner who has a producing well on his or her property at the time of the enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be required to abandon the same unless (1) such well becomes a source of contamination to the water system of the city or of any other party; (2) such well becomes a public health hazard; (3) the owner elects to connect to the municipal water system; (4) the owner applies to the city for a division of the land on which the well is located; (5) the owner applies to the city for a building permit for the land where the well is located; or (6) such well has not been actively used in the production of water for a period in excess of one year. If any of the foregoing six circumstances occur(s), then the owner of the subject property shall immediately abandon the producing well in the manner directed by the water superintendent of the city. 
(Ord. 585 §1 (part), 2001).

13.12.030 - Evaporative cooler-Requirements. 
    In any and all cases where evaporative coolers are supplied with water from the city water system to be used as a cooling agent, such coolers will be fitted with a pump by means of which the water may be raised from the drip pan to the filter pads of the cooler. The pump may be an integral motor-driven unit or may be driven by the fan motor of the cooler, but in any case shall be sufficient capacity to obviate the necessity of a continual supply of water from the city water line to the cooler. The water supply line to an evaporative cooler shall be equipped with a manually or electrically operated valve or float valve which shall normally be kept closed and without leakage. It shall be opened only when make up water is being supplied to the cooler. The drain line from the drip pan of the cooler may be conducted to the sewer installation on the premises, or the water may be used for sprinkling or irrigation purposes upon the property whereon the cooler is located; provided, that such water is not permitted to be discharged in one place, but is moved from place to place with sufficient regularity to prevent the growth of noxious weeds or breeding of mosquitoes or creating other problems of health. 
(Ord. 195 §3, 1963). 
13.12.040 - Escape of water into public streets or sew-ers prohibited. 
    Any sprinkling of yards or lawns from city-supplied water sources shall be so carried on that the water shall not escape from the property into the city streets or sewers. In like manner, water which has been used in the operation of evaporative coolers shall not be permitted to escape from the land whereon the cooler is situated into the public streets or sewers. 
(Ord. 195 §4, 1963). 
13.12.050 - Swimming pools-Draining or changing of water. 
    In the draining of swimming pools or the changing of the water in swimming pools, the water shall not be discharged upon the public streets or into storm sewers, but shall be discharged into the sewer on the premises where the swimming pool is located. The discharge opening to the city sewer shall not exceed one and one-half inches. 
(Ord. 195 §5, 1963). 
13.12.060 - Inspection generally. 
    The director of public works shall cause all air conditioning systems, evaporative coolers and swimming pools to be inspected from time to time for compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. 195 §6, 1963). 
13.12.070 - Noncompliance-Correction-Notice. 
    In case of noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter, the director of public works shall notify the offending person or persons to correct the condition within ten days. 
(Ord. 195 §7, 1963). 
13.12.080 - Noncompliance-Discontinuance of service. 
A.  In the event of the failure or refusal of the offending person to comply as ordered, the director of public works shall cause the city-supplied water to the property to be stopped and the water service discontinued. 
B.  In addition to any other action which may be taken, any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such. 
(Ord. 195 §8, 1963). 
Chapter 13.14 - PROPOSED WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM 
Sections: 

13.14.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish a proposed water conservation program to equitably distribute the available water to the city's customers and to ensure an adequate supply for human consumption, sanitation and fire protection. The purposes of this plan are met by the establishment of a four stage plan of management. 
(Ord. 545 §1(part), 1994). 
13.14.020 - Stage I-Volunteer conservation program-Fifteen percent reduction in normal usage. 
    The following represent the elements of Stage I of the proposed water conservation program: 
A.  Notification to customers by direct mailing, newsletters, press releases, public meetings, educational materials (handouts) and/or meetings in the local schools explaining that a drought condition exists and that the city must reduce its water consumption. Local grade schools may be encouraged to hold water conservation poster contests. The posters could be displayed by local merchants in their windows for a period of time; 
B.  Provide educational literature for conservation practices regarding waste, over watering, leaks, etc. 
Provide information and assistance to customers on reading their water meters and monitoring water usage; 
C.  Encourage the use of native plants or other water conserving vegetation; 
D.  Encourage the use of efficient landscaping systems (drip, timed sprinkler, etc.). Encourage evening and early morning watering to reduce evaporation; 
E.  Discourage the emptying and refilling of swimming pools, ponds, etc; 
F.  Informational/educational warnings for waste, overwatering and leaks; 
G.  Encourage water-reducing methods in household use (full loads for dishwasher and clothes washer, low-flow showerhead, patio sweeping, use shut-off valve on hose for car washing and watering, patio cleaning, etc.). 
(Ord. 545 §1(part), 1994). 
13.14.030 - Stage II-Mandatory reduction of outdoor irrigation of ornamental landscapes or turf with potable water.[4] 
A.  All customers must reduce their consumption in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  All customers must limit outdoor irrigation of ornamental landscapes or turf with potable water to no more than two days per week; 
2.  Outdoor irrigation shall be limited to between the hours of eight p.m. and eight a.m. 
3.  Upon a customer's violation of Section 13.14.030 (A)(1) or (2) the public works director shall provide an advisory letter of the violation. Every subsequent violation occurring in the following twelve-month period shall be assessed a penalty of fifty dollars per day for each violation. 
B.  New water service connections may be granted by the public works director upon the condition that the water shall be used for internal purposes, or if used outside the onsite structure for landscaping, it shall be used to irrigate landscape features that are drought tolerant (xeriscape) plants until drought conditions are lifted. The following consumption conditions will be applicable: 
1.  New service will be limited to eleven thousand gallons of water per month, and such water will be charged at the current rates in effect. 
2.  A penalty of fifty dollars per day for each and every day the eleven thousand gallon allotment is exceeded and where water usage continues to occur by the customer in that given month; 
C.  Water service to landscape maintenance districts, parks, cemeteries and other services which fall in this category will be required to comply with the same restrictions as the other customers. Notwithstanding this directive, the city council may find and declare that a particular property is temporarily exempt from compliance with the provision of this Section where the following is determined: 
1.  That the property is presently bound to abide by the water conservancy measures imposed by the city; 
2.  That the property is accessible to the general public; and 
3.  That by granting a temporary exemption of the water conservation measures imposed in this section, a substantial benefit is derived to the general public accessing such property. 
D.  Water service for construction projects will be handled on a case-by-case basis. A written request detailing the needs, time of use, etc., will be required and reviewed by staff. Final approval for services in this category (construction projects) will be granted by the director of public works. Services in this category will be monitored on a project basis.

(Ord. 545 §1(part), 1994). 
13.14.060 - Special conditions. 
A.  Special Conditions: 
1.  During drought years, city wells will be closely monitored in respect to groundwater level. When the groundwater drops significantly, the city council will be notified to implement Stage I. Should groundwater continue to drop, council would be notified to implement further reduction measures. Conservation measures shall be in effect until such time that staff notifies council that groundwater levels have recovered sufficiently to remove water use restrictions. 
2.  When available, actual previous four-year average usage will be used to determine allocations. For any situations when a full four years of data is not available, the available data will be used. If previous data is not available, the allocation will be based on histories of a comparable type customer 
3.  Previous four-year average consumptions will be used to determine allocations available to each service address (customer). When a new customer transfers a service address into their name, the four-year average consumption for that address will be used to determine their allocations. 
4.  No transfer of water will be allowed between billing cycles, customers or service addresses. 
5.  Any customer who wilfully neglects to adhere to the provisions of the mandatory stages of this proposed water conservation program will be issued a written warning. Continued negligence will be reviewed by the director of public works for corrective action necessary to insure compliance. Compliance measures may include the installation of a flow restrictor at the meter. 
(Ord. 545 §1(part), 1994). 
13.14.070 - Exceptions, variances and appeals. 
A.  For hardship cases only, variances may be granted for any of the regulations in this chapter upon application in writing stating, in detail, the circumstances warranting special consideration.

B.  It must be recognized that in times of water shortage emergencies, the city has very limited discretion to grant exceptions and/or variances to this drought management plan. 
(Ord. 545 §1 (part), 1994). 
Chapter 13.16 - FEES FOR PLANNED DRAINAGE FACILITIES 
Sections: 

13.16.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  The city council does find that there is substantial new construction of residential and commercial structures in the city, which has resulted in serious deficiencies in the drainage of surface water and stormwater from the city area. The entire city shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be considered as one drainage area. The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 66483 of the Government Code of the state of California. 
B.  The city of Corning is located in the county of Tehama, which has not adopted a countywide general drainage plan, and there is no district in the county, in which the city is included, which has a district-wide general drainage plan. 
(Ord. 341 §§1, 3, 1979). 
13.16.020 - Drainage plan generally-Costs. 
    The city has adopted a drainage plan for the city, which plan was adopted by resolution of the city council on January 22, 1979. The estimated total cost of constructing the drainage facilities required by the plan is one million eight hundred fifty thousand dollars, based on a 1978 Engineering News Record construction costs index. The construction cost estimate and corresponding fees will be amended periodically in accordance with the engineering construction costs applicable to the period when the work is actually undertaken. A map showing the drainage area, and the location of the drainage facilities is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Exhibit A. 
(Ord. 341 §2, 1979). 
13.16.030 - Construction of facilities-Schedule of fees. 
    The city council has made findings that the estimated costs of the drainage plan, as set forth in Section 13.16.020, are as accurate as possible, and that the subdivision and development of property in the city will require construction of the facilities described in the drainage plan. The schedule of fees which the city council has adopted by resolution are fairly apportioned within the area of the city on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision or on the need for such facilities created by the proposed subdivision and development of other property within the city. 
(Ord. 341 §4, 1979). 
13.16.040 - Relation to existing facilities. 
    The drainage facilities planned are in addition to existing facilities serving the area at the time of the adoption of the drainage plan for the city. 
(Ord. 341 §6, 1979). 
13.16.050 - Drainage fees-Generally. 
    The drainage fees provided for in this chapter are in addition to any other fees which might be levied by the city for new construction of either residential or commercial property. The drainage fees shall be applied only to lands which are subdivided as shown on a tentative or parcel map filed thirty days or more after May 23, 1979, or to developments of real property. As used in this chapter, "developments of real property" refers to any commercial or manufacturing developments or mobile home parks to be located on land not subdivided for residential purposes. 
(Ord. 341 §10, 1979). 
13.16.060 - Drainage facility fee-Limitation. 
    The drainage facility fee as to any property proposed for subdivision within the city shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total actual or estimated cost of all facilities within the city which would be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a per-acre basis. 
(Ord. 341 §5, 1979). 
13.16.070 - Fees-Payment and use. 
    The fees provided for in this chapter shall be paid to the city at the time of the approval by the city council of any final subdivision map, or the approval of any development. In the event the fee is not paid when due, no building permits shall be issued for construction of any facilities or structures. In those instances where only a building permit is required, the fee shall be paid when the building permit is issued, and the building permit shall not be issued unless such fees are paid. The fees which are paid shall be deposited into a special fund, to be designated as planned local drainage facilities fund. Moneys from such funds shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of city drainage facilities within the city, or to reimburse the city for the cost of engineering and administrative services to form the area and design and construct the facilities. The city council shall have the option of accepting consideration other than money in lieu of the payment of fees. Consideration other than money shall be of a value at least equal to what the fees would have been. 
(Ord. 341 §7, 1979). 
13.16.080 - Use of surplus funds. 
    After the completion of the drainage facilities, if there be any surplus in the drainage facilities fund, the surplus shall be distributed in the manner provided by Section 66483.1 of the Government Code of California. 
(Ord. 341 §8, 1979). 
13.16.090 - Payment of acreage fee-Options by city. 
    The city shall have the following options: 
A.  To collect from the subdivider or developer the acreage fee which is fixed from time to time by resolution. If the city elects to take this option, the subdivider or developer is not obligated to provide any off-site drainage work; 
B.  To require the subdivider or developer to do off-site drainage works, in accordance with city specifications and standards, whereby the subdivider or developer would connect the subdivision or development to a natural drain or storm drain, subject to the approval of the city engineer. The cost to the subdivider or developer of installing the off-site drainage works shall be credited against an amount equal to what the acreage fee would have been and if the cost thereof is less than what the acreage fee would have been, the subdivider or developer shall pay to the city the difference between his cost and the acreage fee. 
(Ord. 341 §9, 1979). 
Chapter 13.19 - TRAFFIC MITIGATION FEES-STREET, BRIDGES AND SIGNALIZATION 
Sections: 

13.19.010 - Funding and purpose. 
    The city council does find that Corning is facing considerable growth, and such growth will overwhelm existing streets, intersections and bridges. The city, through its master planning, has taken into account the impacts and proposes the implementation of a fee to be levied on all new development in order to ensure that all development shares fairly in the cost of building the required city infrastructure. 
(Ord. 619 (part), 2005: Ord. 618 (part), 2005). 
13.19.050 - Traffic mitigation fee due. 
    A traffic mitigation fee for the purposes of providing for street, bridge and signalization improvements shall be paid to the city at the time of issuance of a building permit for each new single-family dwelling unit, each new multifamily dwelling unit, in new or expanding mobile home parks, each new mobile home or manufactured home, and each new commercial or industrial acre developed. 
A.  The fee shall be paid at the time of issuance of a building permit. 
B.  Each single-family unit shall pay one equivalent dwelling unit fee. 
C.  Each multifamily unit and mobile home unit shall pay one equivalent dwelling unit fee for each new dwelling unit. 
D.  For commercial and industrial development, including new motels and hotels, the fees shall be calculated at four equivalent dwelling units times each acre rounded to the next higher full acre. Such acreage fee is calculated on the basis of the average residential dwelling unit capacity of four units per acre. 
E.  The city recognizes that there are many methods of computing traffic mitigation fees, but has determined that the simple method of calculating mitigation fees on the basis of equivalent dwelling units (EDU) makes it possible for both builders and the city to quickly calculate costs while ensuring that the costs of infrastructure are spread evenly among all those who wish to build. 
F.  The initial traffic mitigation fee for streets, bridges and traffic signalization shall be set at five thousand four hundred eighty-eight dollars per dwelling unit or equivalent dwelling unit. 
G.  The city council may, from time to time, make changes in the traffic mitigation fees, by resolution of the city council. 
H.  The traffic mitigation fees for streets, bridges and signalization shall be collected and placed in a fund and used solely for traffic mitigation as approved by the city council. 
(Ord. 619 (part), 2005: Ord. 618 (part), 2005).

Chapter 15.17 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[4] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 652, § 1, adopted May 28, 2013, amended Chapter 15.17 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Chapter 15.17, §§ 15.17.010-15.17.220, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Ordinance List and the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for full disposition. 

15.17.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Corning does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Corning are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

    "Accessory structure" means a structure that is either: 
1.  Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or 
2.  A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars in value. 
    "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

    "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter.

    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "Flooding." 
    "Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.

    "Fraud and victimization," as related to Sections 15.17.230 through 15.17.250 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

a.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.17.170 C.3.; 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.17.170 A; 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.17.170 B; and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.17.180. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sheet flow area" - see "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means: 
1.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or 
2.  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement.

15.17.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
    The city building official is designated the floodplain administrator for the city of Corning and is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Corning; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage. 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.17.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 15.17.170 through 15.17.220. 
    NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
    Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 15.17.170 C.1 and Section 15.17.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.17.170 C.2 (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Sections 15.17.170 C.3 (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.17.190 A.3 (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.17.220 B (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.17.160. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.17.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
J.  Non-conversion of Enclosed Areas Below the Lowest Floor. To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the floodplain administrator shall: 
1.  Determine which applicants for new construction and/or substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are five feet or higher; 
2.  Enter into a "Non-Conversion Agreement For Construction Within Floodplain Areas" or equivalent with the city of Corning.

"Accessory structures" used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in Section 15.17.050 may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements: 
a)  Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited storage; 
b)  The portions of the accessory structure located below the BFE must be built using flood-resistant materials; 
c)  The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement; 
d)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the BFE; 
e)  The accessory structure must comply with floodplain encroachment provisions in Section 15.17.220; and 
f)  The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of flood waters in accordance with Section 15.17.170 C 3. 
2.  Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 15.17.170. 
5.  Crawlspace Construction. This subsection applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to two feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. 
a.  The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or engineer; 
b.  The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technology Bulletin 1-93; 
c.  Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; 
d.  Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and 
e.  Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above the BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. 
f.  Requirements of all below-grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following: 
1.  The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01; 
2.  The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed four feet (shown as L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any point; 
3.  There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event, not to exceed seventy-two hours; and 
4.  The velocity of the floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.180 - Standards for utilities. 
A.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.190 - Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development. 
A.  All new subdivisions proposals and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
1.  Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood elevations (BFE). 
2.  Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures and pads on the final plans. 
3.  If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the floodplain administrator: 
a.  Lowest floor elevation. 
b.  Pad elevation. 
c.  Lowest adjacent grade. 
B.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
C.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
D.  All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.200 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Section 15.17.200 A will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.210 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed in zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.17.150 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.17.200 A. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.220 - Floodways. 
    Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Corning. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Corning shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Sections 15.17.220 A and B are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.17.170 through 15.17.220. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.230 - Nature of variances. 
    The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.240 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.17.130 through 15.17.220 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.17.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Tehama County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
15.17.250 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.17.250 A through 15.17.250 D are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.17.240 A and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. 508 §1.04, 1991) 
ARTICLE II. - GENERAL CRITERIA AND STANDARDS 

15.28.040 - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to any new residential, commercial, industrial, institutional or utility development. 
(Ord. 508 §2.01, 1991). 
15.28.050 - Maximum allowable release rate. 
    The maximum allowable release rate of stormwater originating from the proposed development shall not exceed 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre and shall not exceed the predetermined safe carrying capacity of any limiting downstream restriction. If more than one detention basin is involved in the development of the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from any one detention basin shall be in the direct ratio that its drainage area bears to the entire drainage area of the watershed. 
(Ord. 508 §2.02, 1991). 
15.28.060 - On-site detention of excess stormwater runoff. 
    The increased stormwater runoff resulting from the proposed development will be detained on-site by the provision of appropriate wet or dry bottom reservoirs, by leach trenches, by storage on flat roofs, parking lots, on streets, or by other acceptable techniques. Storage will be sufficient to store flows from twenty-five-year storms of four-hour durations in excess of the runoff from the site before development. Control devices shall limit the discharge from storage to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this chapter. 
(Ord. 508 §2.03, 1991). 
15.28.070 - Other retarding measures. 
    Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels such as swales or ponding are encouraged to par-tially control runoff rates. 
(Ord. 508 §2.04, 1991). 
15.28.080 - Joint development of control systems. 
    Stormwater control systems may be planned in coordination by two or more property owners as long as flood or stormwater hazards are not increased at intervening locations. 
(Ord. 508 §2.05, 1991). 
15.28.090 - Detention facilities in floodplains. 
A.  If detention storage is provided within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood at that location unless compensatory storage is also provided. 
B.  Facilities in Floodway Fringes. An exception to the policy in subsection A of this section is authorized when the floodways and floodway fringes have been established for floodplains by state or federal agencies. Under those conditions, detention facilities may be authorized in floodway fringe areas and no compensatory storage will be deemed necessary. 
(Ord. 508 §2.06, 1991). 
15.28.100 - Flows from upland areas. 
    The total tributary area must be used in calculating the allowable release rate. The required storage volume will be based on the project area only, with extraneous flows from upland areas being bypassed or discharged via overflow spillways or other devices. 
(Ord. 508 §2.07, 1991). 
15.28.110 - Certification of documents. 
    All computations, plans and specifications related to the implementation of this chapter must be prepared and sealed by a pro-fessional engineer registered in California.

    The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to controlling the runoff of stormwaters: 
A.  Design. Streets, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to reduce the velocity of overland flow and allow the maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwaters into the ground, and to preserve and utilize natural streams, channels and detention basins. 
B.  Channel Straightening. Meandering streams on channels may be partly straightened and minor changes made in other channels where it can be demonstrated that down-stream flooding will not be increased in frequency on depth. 
C.  Streets Designed for Detention. Cross-sections of streets selected by the developer for the detention of stormwater runoffs shall be constructed above flood elevations and shall be designed to temporarily store and convey flows in excess of storm drain capacities, together with over-the-curb runoff. Those streets also shall be provided with adequate outlets for the safe disposal of flows. Where grading of lots is necessary to avoid damage to adjoining buildings, the lot grade adjacent to each building should be at least two feet higher than the crown of the pavement, and the minimum sill elevation of openings in the outer walls of such habitable buildings shall be at least two and one-half feet above the crown elevation. 
D.  Manholes. All sanitary sewer and storm drain manholes constructed in a floodplain, in a street designed for detention, or in an area designed for the storage or passage of flood or stormwaters, shall be provided with either a watertight bolted manhole cover, or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of one foot above the high water elevation of the design flood or the high water elevation of the design storm, whichever is applicable to the specific area. 
(Ord. 508 §3.03, 1991). 
15.28.150 - Detention basins. 
    Basins may be construct-ed to temporarily detain the stormwater runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this chapter. 
A.  Storage Volumes. The volume of storage provided in these basins, together with storage as may be authorized in other on-site facilities, will be sufficient to control the runoff from the twenty-five-year storm of four-hour duration. 
B.  Maximum Depth. The maximum planned depth of stormwaters stoned shall not normally exceed six feet. 
C.  Side Slopes. The side slopes of the basin will conform as closely as possible to regraded or natural land contours and preferably shall be under ten percent. If the side slopes exceed twenty percent, erosion control and safety measures shall be provided. 
D.  Outlet Control Structures. Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate simply and automatically. They will limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed predetermined maximum authorized peak flow rates. 
E.  Emergency Spillway. Emergency overflow facilities must be provided in all instances so that stoned waters will not exceed the safe capacity of the basin. 
(Ord. 508 §3.04, 1991). 
15.28.160 - Wet bottom basins. 
    For basins designed with permanent pools: 
A.  Wet bottom basins shall not be permitted unless specifically approved by the city council. 
(Ord. 508 §3.05, 1991). 
15.28.170 - Dry bottom basins. 
    For detention basins designed to be completely dewatered: 
A.  Interior Drainage. Provisions must be incorporated to facilitate complete interior drainage of dry bottom basins, to include the provision of natural grades to out-let structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to per-imeter drainage facilities, pumps or the installation of subsurface drains. 
B.  Multipurpose Features. These shall be designed to serve secondary purposes for recreation, open space or other types of use which will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. 
C.  Aesthetics. Designs should result in aesthetical-ly pleasing configurations which will enhance public acceptability. 
(Ord. 508 §3.06, 1991). 
ARTICLE IV. - BUILDING REGULATIONS 

15.28.180 - Rooftop storage. 
    Detention storage requirements may be met in total or in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of such designs to be included in the building permit application shall include the depth and volume of storage, details of outlet devices and down-drains, elevations of overflow scuppers, design loadings for the roof structure and emergency overflow provisions. 
(Ord. 508 §4.01, 1991). 
15.28.190 - Parking lot storage. 
    Paved parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or a portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to slowly empty the stored water, and depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles and access to parked vehicles is not impaired. Ponding should be relegated to those positions of the parking lots farthest from the area served. 
(Ord. 508 §4.02, 1991). 
15.28.200 - Other detention storage. 
    All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided in underground or surface detention facilities, to include basins, tanks, swales or leach trenches. 
(Ord. 508 §4.03, 1991). 
15.28.210 - Maintenance. 
    Designs of detention facilities will incorporate features which facilitate their inspection and maintenance. The growth of obnoxious weeds, the creation of conditions which support the growth of mosquitoes and other insects, and the decrease in available storage by accumulated sediments will all be controlled. The cleanup of accumulated debris and other materials after runoff events have subsided will be assured. Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one lot or holding will be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds or by other methods acceptable to the city unless responsibility is formally assigned to a public body. 
A.  Inspections. All privately owned detention storage facilities may, as resources permit, be inspected by representatives of the city not less often than once every three years. A certified report will be submitted covering the physical conditions, required storage capacity and operational conditions of key elements of the facility. 
B.  Corrective Measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector, the owner(s) of the detention facility may be required to take the necessary measures to eliminate nuisances and correct structural deficiencies. If the owner(s) fails to do so, the city may undertake the work and collect from the owner(s) using lien rights if necessary. 
(Ord. 508 §4.04, 1991). 
15.28.220 - Safety features. 
    Designs of detention facilities will incorporate safety features, particularly at outlets, on steep slopes and at any attractive nuisances to include, as necessary, fencing, handrails, lighting, steps, grills, signs and other protective or warning devices so as to restrict access during critical periods and to afford some measure of safety to both authorized persons. 
(Ord. 508 §4.05, 1991). 
ARTICLE V. - ADMINISTRATION 

15.28.230 - Enforcement.

D.  Other Retarding Measures. Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels such as swales or ponding are encouraged to partially control runoff rates. 
E.  Joint Development of Control Systems. Stormwater control systems may be planned in coordination by two or more property owners as long as flood or stormwater hazards are not increased at intervening locations. 
F.  Detention Facilities in Floodplains. If detention storage is provided within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood at that location unless compensatory storage is also provided. 
1.  Facilities in Floodway Fringes. An exception to the above policy is authorized when the floodways and floodway fringes have been established for floodplains by state or federal agencies. Under those conditions, detention facilities may be authorized in floodway fringe areas and no compensatory storage will be deemed necessary. 
G.  Flows from Upland Areas. The total tributary area must be used in calculating the allowable release rate. The required storage volume will be based on the project area only, with extraneous flows from upland areas being by-passed or discharged via overflow spillways or other devices. 
H.  Certification of Documents. All computations, plans and specifications related to the implementation to this title must be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer registered in California. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994).

C.  Site Plan. As described in Section 16.25.050(C). 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.070 - Subdivision design. 
    The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to controlling the runoff of stormwaters: 
A.  Design. Streets, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to reduce the velocity of overland flow and allow the maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwaters into the ground, and to preserve and utilize natural streams, channels and detention basins. 
B.  Channel Straightening. Meandering streams or channels may be partly straightened and minor changes made in other channels where it can be demonstrated that downstream flooding will not be increased in frequency or depth. 
C.  Streets Designed for Detention. Cross sections of streets selected by the developer for the detention of stormwater runoff shall be constructed above flood elevations and shall be designed to temporarily store and convey flows in excess of storm drain capacities, together with over-the-curb runoff. Those streets also shall be provided with adequate outlets for the safe disposal of flows. Where grading of lots is necessary to avoid damage to adjoining buildings, the lot grade adjacent to each building should be at least two feet higher than the crown of the pavement, and the minimum sill elevation of openings in the outer walls of such habitable buildings shall be at least two and one-half feet above the crown elevation. 
D.  Manholes. All sanitary sewer and storm-drain manholes constructed in a floodplain, in a street designed for detention, or in an area designed for the storage or passage of flood or storm water, shall be provided with either a watertight bolted manhole cover, or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of one foot above the high water elevation of the design flood or the high water elevation of the design storm, whichever is applicable to the specific area. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.080 - Detention basin. 
    Basins may be constructed to temporarily detain the stormwater runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this title. 
A.  Storage Volumes. The volume of storage provided in these basins, together with such storage as may be authorized in other on-site facilities, will be sufficient to control the runoff from the twenty-five-year storm of four-hour duration. 
B.  Maximum Depth. The maximum planned depth of stormwaters stored shall not normally exceed six feet. 
C.  Side Slopes. The side slopes of the basin will conform as closely as possible to natural land contours and preferably shall be under ten percent. If the side slopes exceed twenty percent, erosion control and safety measures shall be provided. 
D.  Outlet Control Structures. Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate simply and automatically. They will limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed predetermined maximum authorized peak flow rates. 
E.  Emergency Spillway. Emergency overflow facilities must be provided in all instances so that stored waters will not exceed the safe capacity of the basin. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.090 - Wet bottom basins. 
    For basins designed with permanent pools: 
A.  Wet bottom basins shall not be permitted unless specifically approved by the city council. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.100 - Dry bottom basins. 
    For detention basins designed to be completely dewatered: 
A.  Interior Drainage. Provisions must be incorporated to facilitate complete interior drainage of dry bottom basins, to include the provision of natural grades to outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities, pumps, or the installation of subsurface drains. 
B.  Multipurpose Features. These shall be designed to serve secondary purposes for recreation, open space or other types of use which will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. 
C.  Aesthetics. Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing configurations which will enhance public acceptability. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.110 - Building regulations. 
A.  Rooftop Storage. Detention storage requirements may be met in total or in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of such designs to be included in the building permit application shall include the depth and volume of storage, scuppers, design loadings for the roof structure and emergency overflow provisions. 
B.  Parking Lot Storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to slowly empty the stored water, and depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles and access to parked vehicles is not impaired. Ponding should be relegated to those positions of the parking lots farthest from the area served. 
C.  Other Detention Storage. All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided in underground or surface detention facilities, to include basins, tanks, swales or leach trenches. 
D.  Maintenance. Designs of detention facilities will incorporate features which facilitate their inspection and maintenance. The growth of obnoxious weeds, the creation of insects, and the decrease in available storage by accumulated sediments will all be controlled. The cleanup of accumulated debris and other materials after runoff events have subsided will be assured. 
    Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one lot or holding will be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds or by other methods acceptable to the city unless responsibility is formally assigned to a public body. 
1.  Inspections. All privately owned detention storage facilities may, as resources permit, be inspected by representatives of the city not less often than once every three years. A certified report will be submitted covering the physical conditions, required storage capacity and operational conditions of key elements of the facility. 
2.  Corrective Measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector, the owner(s) of the detention facility may be required to take the necessary measures to eliminate nuisances and correct structural deficiencies. If the owner(s) fails to do so, the city may undertake the work and collect from the owner(s) using lien rights if necessary. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.120 - Safety features. 
    Designs of detention facilities will incorporate safety features, particularly at outlets, on steep slopes, and at any attractive nuisances to include, as necessary, fencing, hand rails, lighting and steps in order to restrict access during critical periods and to afford some measure of safety to both authorized persons. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.25.130 - Administration. 
A.  Responsibility. The administration of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the director of the department of public works. 
1.  Variances. No variance shall be issued without the prior concurrence of the city council. 
2.  Special Use Permit. No special use permit shall be issued without the prior concurrence of the city council. 
B.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this title, the provisions expressed herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city of Corning and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes or exercised by Uniform Building Code requirements.

Chapter 16.26 - DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS 
Sections: 

16.26.010 - Two development patterns. 
    Two development pattern options are acceptable. One pattern is the traditional, uniform development design pattern. The second pattern is a planned development pattern which is designed to conform to physical constraints and opportunities afforded by the site. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.26.020 - Uniform development pattern. 
A.  The city will permit traditional, grid-based, uniform development if all of the following site conditions exist: 
1.  No natural area in the development exceeding a ten-percent slope; 
2.  Absence of one-hundred-year floodplain, natural spring, seasonal stream course of wetland; 
3.  Absence of established natural tree cover or groves of trees the mature individuals of which have trunk diameters exceeding six inches at three feet above ground level;

5.  No evidence of rare or endangered plant or animal species; 
6.  No riparian habitat as delineated on maps or as defined in text adopted by the city. 
B.  Permitted Densities and Design. Where a uniform development pattern is approved by the city, the maximum densities will be allowed, as specified by the appropriate zoning district classification. 
C.  Density Bonuses (Affordable Housing). In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the environmental conservation policies of the land use element and the affordable housing requirements of the housing element density, bonuses may be allowed. The city may allocate these bonuses as specified by Chapter 4.3 of the State Planning, Zoning and Development Law. Government Code Section 65915. 
    To qualify for affordable housing density bonuses, the development proponent must agree to provide all additional bonus units in the form of units determined to be needed by the housing element of the general plan. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.26.030 - Planned development pattern. 
A.  A planned development pattern will be required by the city whenever local site conditions indicate a need for environmental conservation due to an unstable, hazardous or ecologically sensitive landscape. Design review by the city will be required and will be consistent with all policies and standards of the PD use permit provisions of city regulations. 
B.  Conditions Requiring a Planned Development Pattern. Where the conditions listed below are found on a project site development shall conform to a plan submitted to the planning commission. This plan shall conform to the city's design review guidelines and planned development use permit zoning regulations. The plan shall also include conditions applied to development relating to density, grading, land cover, landscaping, improvements, erosion control and/or surface restoration. 
1.  Natural area within the project site exceeding ten percent slope; 
2.  One-hundred-year floodplain, natural spring, seasonal stream course or wetland; 
3.  Natural tree cover or stands of trees, the mature individual of which have trunk diameters exceeding six inches at three feet above ground level; 
4.  Evidence of highly erodible soils or unstable surface or subsurface geology; 
5.  Evidence of rare or endangered plant or animal species; 
6.  Presence on site of a greenway overlay designated in general plan or zoning district text and/or maps; 
7.  Presence on site of a noise corridor overlay designated in general plan or zoning district text and/or maps; 
8.  Annexation or prezoning is requested. 
C.  Permitted Density and Design. Where a planned development pattern is approved by the city, the maximum density will be established as specified by the appropriate zoning district and as specified in these land development policies in Part III. (Design Policies for Environmental Conditions Requiring Planned Development Pattern). 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
Chapter 16.27 - GROUND COVER STANDARDS 
Sections: 

16.27.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these standards is to promote site development practices that will preserve the natural physical site characteristics of development sites in the city of Corning. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.020 - Development prohibited in certain areas. 
    Plans must be submitted to the city demonstrating that the following areas will not be disturbed: 
A.  Areas with a natural (undisturbed by human activity) slope of twenty percent or more; 
B.  Areas within a one-hundred-year floodplain as delineated on the current flood insurance rate maps (F.I.R.M.) published by the Federal Emergency Management Administration; 
C.  Areas within the boundaries of the one-hundred-year flood level of any seasonal stream or drainage way is such a boundary if not delineated on the F.I.R.M. described in subsection (B) of this section; 
D.  Areas between the tops of banks of seasonal or year-round creeks, sloughs, streams, drainage ways or oxbows;

G.  Areas within fifty feet of the areas described in subsections (B) through (F) of this section. 
    Exception: The reason for granting an exception to this standard is to avoid loss of all development density if one hundred percent of small lots exist in the areas listed in this section. After making appropriate findings and approving a planned development use permit the planning commission may allow development of the areas listed in this section. Any such areas that are disturbed must be replaced with environmentally equivalent systems. The planning commission does not have the authority to override federal or state regulations and conditions on these matters. 
    Subdivisions shall not create lots that consist entirely of the areas listed in this section. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.030 - Preservation. 
A.  Where surface grading is not required for buildings, facilities or improvements consistent with these policies, nonhazardous and desirable natural vegetation shall be left undisturbed on the site. Trees or shrubs shall not be removed prior to submission and approval of development plans except for weed-mowing abatement procedures. Development plans which minimize disruption of desirable natural vegetation are necessary. 
B.  Streets, buildings and utilities must be aligned away from rare or scenic species. A mixture of large native trees and young trees must be preserved to assure continuation of the species and a balanced landscape as older trees are removed during the life of the project. 
C.  If natural vegetation is lost or damaged, the same species shall be reintroduced to restore original cover as closely as possible. Restore as much of the original vegetation character as possible. Native oak trees with a diameter of six inches or more at three feet above grade, if removed for development, shall be replaced on-site or off-site with the same species or other species approved by the city. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.040 - New vegetation.

B.  Commercial Spaces. Trees or shrubs shall be planted adjacent to sound attenuation walls and walls of commercial, professional and multifamily residential buildings. (This will create visual breaks of the building line.) 
C.  Parking Lots. Trees shall be planted in parking lots at an average density of not less than one tree per three thousand six hundred square feet (approximately sixty feet on center). The mature crown of the tree shall shade at least fifty percent of the surface area of the parking spaces. The planter area for each tree shall not be smaller than the area of one noncompact auto parking space. The trees required in subsection (D) of this section shall not be included in the count of trees required to conform to this section. 
D.  Street Rights-of-Way. Grass, shrubs and trees shall be planted along right-of-way margins to stabilize soil and inhibit surface runoff. Developers should maintain vegetation until such time as the exposures are stabilized. 
E.  Maintenance of Planted Vegetation. Development plans shall include a statement that the owner shall be responsible for irrigating planted vegetation species until they become self-sustaining. Drought-resistant species shall be planted to insure their long-term survival in areas where no permanent irrigation is provided. Landscape maintenance plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.050 - Yards. 
    If trees have not been preserved on a residential lot, at least two shall be planted on the street frontage yard. In nonresidential yards, trees shall be planted in street frontage yards at not more that fifty feet on center.

(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.080 - Street rights-of-way. 
    Grass, shrubs and trees shall be planted along right-of-way margins to stabilize soil and inhibit surface runoff. Developers should maintain vegetation until such time as the exposures are stabilized. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.090 - Maintenance of planted vegetation. 
    The owner should be responsible to irrigate planted vegetation species until they become self-sustaining. Drought resistant species shall be planted to insure their long-term survival in areas where no permanent irrigation is provided. Landscape maintenance plan shall be prepared by qualified personnel. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.27.100 - Applicability. 
    These policies apply to grading activities and vegetation and drainage issues regardless of whether a project is exempt from provisions of the Uniform Building Code, Appendix Chapter 70. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
Chapter 16.29 - FENCING REQUIREMENTS

    Whenever the land involved in any subdivision is of such size or shape or is subject to such title limitations of record or is affected by such topographical location or conditions or is to be devoted to such use that it is impossible, impractical, or undesirable in a particular case for the subdivider to fully conform to the regulations contained in this title, the planning commission may permit modification thereof as may be reasonably necessary if such modifications are in conformity with the spirit and purpose of the Subdivision Map Act and of this title. Application for any such modifications shall be made by a petition of the subdivider, stating fully the grounds of the application and the facts relied upon by the petitioner. Such petition shall be filed with or after the acceptance of the tentative map of the subdivision. In order for the property referred to in the petition to come within the provisions of this chapter, it shall be necessary that the planning commission finds the following facts with respect thereto: 
A.  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property such as topography, fixed rights-of-way, unique location of easements, etc.; or 
B.  Because of the unique nature of a particular subdivision concept, design innovations are proposed which meet the functional standards of the zoning and subdivision regulations without strict adherence to the requirements of this title; or 
C.  That the modification is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner; or 
D.  That the granting of the modification will not be detrimental to the public welfare or safety, or injurious to other property in the territory in which said property is situated. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.30.020 - Referral of proposed modifications. 
A.

(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.30.030 - Condominiums, community apartment and cluster-type subdivisions. 
    In the case of condominium subdivisions and community apartment subdivisions, as defined by the Subdivision Map Act of the state, and cluster-type subdivisions, the planning commission may approve or conditionally approve such subdivisions providing that the following findings are made: 
A.  Adequate light and air space, vehicular and pedestrian access, utilities, including but not limited to water, sewer, electric power, gas and storm drainage, public services, such as fire protection, police protection and solid waste disposal; landscaping and such other factors as the city may deem appropriate, must be provided to insure the development of improvements necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
B.  That a legal entity pursuant to the laws of the state will be established for the control and maintenance of all land and improvements to be held in common. Such legal entity shall possess the authority to make sufficient assessment and be responsible for the maintenance of all facilities and shall be self-sustaining. 
C.  That the granting of approval or conditional approval of such subdivision shall not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which such property is situated. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
Chapter 16.31 - RIGHT TO FARM 
Sections: 

16.31.010 - Definitions. 
    Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions govern the construction of this chapter in order for more effective interpretation and enforcement. 
A.  "Agricultural land" means those land areas of the city designated with an agricultural land use category (Ag.) and/or agricultural zoning districts (R-1-A, A, A-2, and OS-2). 
B.  "Agricultural operation" means and includes, but is not limited to, cultivation and tillage of the soil, the production, irrigation, cultivation, growing, harvesting, processing and storing of any agricultural commodity, including viticulture, horticulture, apiculture, the raising of livestock, dairying, fish, poultry, and commercial practices performed and incident to or in conjunction with such agricultural operation, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or market, or to carriers or transportation to market. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.31.020 - Findings and policy. 
A.  It is the policy of the city of Corning to protect agricultural production, and it is the intent of this policy to provide the citizens of the city proper notification of agriculture's right to farm. 
B.  Where nonagricultural land uses, especially residential development, extend into agricultural areas or exist side by side, agricultural operations have often become the subject of nuisance complaints. As a result, agricultural operations are sometimes forced to cease or curtail operations. 
C.  The further purpose of this code is to promote a good neighbor policy between agriculture and residents by establishing a buffer between agricultural and residential uses. Generally, buffer shall be defined as a physical separation of one hundred to two hundred feet. These may be modified based upon topographic features, a stand of trees, watercourse, or similar existing feature. In some circumstances, a landscaped berm or other man-made feature may enhance the buffer. The requirement for a buffer may be modified following a written recommendation from the agricultural commissioner. 
D.  In addition to providing a buffer, this chapter advises purchasers and users of property adjacent to or near agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with proximity to agricultural operations including but not limited to the sounds, odors, dust and chemicals that may accompany agricultural operations so that such purchasers and users will understand the inconveniences that accompany living side by side with agriculture. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.31.030 - Nuisance. 
    No existing or future agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances conducted in a manner consistent with proper and accepted standards on agricultural land shall become or be a nuisance. 
(Ord. 550 (part), 1994). 
16.31.040 - Consumer disclosure by seller. 
    The transfer of any property located in the city of Corning shall include the delivery of the following disclosure statement required by this chapter to the prospective transferee as follows: 
A.  In the case of a sale, as soon as practicable before transfer of title; 
B.  In the case of transfer by real property sales contract, before execution of the contract. For the purpose of this subsection "execution" means the making or acceptance of an offer.

Multi-family buildings shall contribute to the sense of community by carefully relating to the scale and form of adjacent properties, and by designing street frontages that create architectural and landscape interest for the pedestrian and neighboring residents. The guidelines established in this chapter will be applicable to all multi-family development in R-2, R-3, and R-4 Zoning Districts. 
(Ord. No. 669, 9-27-2016)

1.  The predominant color of the building and accessory structures shall be a muted, non-garish tone. 
2.  Color shall be used as an important accent in the project's appearance. More than one predominant paint color is encouraged. Compatible accent colors shall be used to enhance important architectural elements and features. 
3.  Bright or intense colors shall be used very sparingly, and shall typically be reserved for more refined or delicate detailing. 
4.  Materials such as brick and stone shall be left in their natural colors. 
(Ord. No. 669, 9-27-2016) 
17.11.050 - Landscaping and lighting.

A.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requires that flood-hazard regulations be adopted by all agencies participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, which was established by Congress for the purpose of minimizing flood losses by providing federally subsidized flood insurance for existing structures and reduced premiums for new structures. To participate in the program, the city must adopt and enforce floodplain-management measures to reduce the risk of flood losses. It is the purpose of the FP combining district to implement this federal mandate, to carry out the city's general plan policies regarding development in floodplain areas, and to provide land-use regulations in areas with properties situated within the designated floodplains of rivers, creeks, streams, and watercourses in order to: 
1.  Protect public health, safety, and welfare; 
2.  Minimize public and private losses as a product of floods or construction in flood-hazard areas; 
3.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood damage by incorporating floodproof construction standards in their design or be developed outside flood-prone areas at the time of their initial construction; 
4.  Protect riparian corridors along waterways by reducing alterations to the natural floodplain and stream channels which help accommodate floodwaters by encouraging sensitive development adjacent to and within floodplains; 
5.  Prohibit filling, grading, dredging, or development which may individually or cumulatively cause flood damage or danger to life or property; 
6.  Prevent stream erosion which may adversely affect the fisheries of streams and the river or cause loss of property; 
7.  Prevent the construction of flood barriers which may unnaturally direct floodwaters or raise flood levels thereby increasing flood hazards in other areas; 
8.  Protect areas of pleasing appearance to the community and visitors; enhance the natural environment through the provision of open space; break up the monotony of continuous urban development; and increase community pride; 
9.  Make every effort to reserve and improve public access to and along the creeks for riding, hiking, fishing, and nature observation; 
10.  Encourage development to occur outside of flood-prone areas; 
11.  Reduce public liability and the need for expensive public works projects in flood-prone areas; 
12.  Preserve wildlife and wildlife habitat along the Sacramento River and area creeks from erosion, loss of vegetation, degradation of water quality, and a loss of thermal cooling; 
13.  Ensure that adequate capacity for future urban runoff is reserved; 
14.  Ensure that, as a product of any encroachment into the floodplain, flood levels are not significantly raised on other properties resulting in a need for further encroachment to protect the property; 
15.  Ensure that stream velocities are not significantly increased which could cause erosion above, below, or across from an area of encroachment or realignment; 
16.  Ensure that proposals to encroach into floodplains fully address the following issues: 
a.  Size of a stream, major or minor, 
b.  Existing and future volume of water, 
c.  Existing and future changes in the velocity of water, 
d.  Impact on adjoining properties, 
e.  Potential for increased erosion upstream or downstream, 
f.  Potential for riprap and type of riprap, 
g.  Riparian habitat, 
h.  Fisheries and wildlife, 
i.  Urban trails and fishing access, 
j.  Water temperature, 
k.  Aesthetics, 
l.  General plan consistency, 
m.  Liability, both public and private, 
n.  Depth of floodplain and fill needed, 
o.  Amount of existing usable area on parcel and additional area to be created, 
p.  Maintenance responsibility and costs, 
q.  Short-term gains versus long-term costs, 
r.  Future increases in runoff; 
17.  Protect individuals from buying land by identifying such land which is unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.

    "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of flood water, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels, or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature such as a flash flood, or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition. 
    "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway. 
    "Flood fringe" means the area between the one-hundred-year flood boundary and the floodway shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map incorporated in the Flood Insurance Study. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the "floodplain" and "risk-premium" zones applicable to the city. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the FIRM, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water-surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain" includes the floodway, flood fringe, and means the same as "base floodplain" and the "area of special flood hazard." "Floodplain" or "floodplain area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. (See definition of "flooding.") The elevations and boundaries of flooding within the floodplain are defined by zones A, AO, A1-30, and AE of the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
    For creeks where FEMA has not established floodplain elevations with a detailed study, the elevations shall be determined by a registered civil engineer and approved by the planning commission pursuant to Section 18.47.110. 
    "Floodplain area" means an area having flood, mud slide (i.e., mud flow and/or flood-related erosion hazards, as shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map. 
    "Floodplain district (FP)" is a zoning district that is combined with other zoning designations of lots that are either wholly or partially within the floodplain. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of zoning corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood-control works, and floodplain-management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state of local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood-damage prevention and reduction. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate, or improved real property, water, and sanitary facilities, and structures and their contents.

    "Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a river, creek, or other body of water as a result of erosion of undermining caused by currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels, or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature such as a flash flood or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    "Floodway" includes the channel and adjacent area of a waterway that must be kept free of encroachment or alteration in order that a base-flood event may be carried without substantial increases in flood heights or flood velocities. The width and location of the floodway are determined by cross sections presented in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency dated January 3, 1985, on file in the city planning department, as may be amended from time to time. 
    "Freeboard" means a factor of safety expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    "Hydraulic Engineering Center Model 1 (HEC-1)." The model is designed to stimulate the surface runoff response of a stream basin to precipitation by representing the basin as an interconnected system of hydrologic and hydraulic components. Each component models an aspect of the precipitation-runoff process within a portion of the basin, commonly referred to as a subbasin. A component may represent a surface-runoff entity, a stream channel, or a reservoir. Representation of a component requires a set of parameters which specify the particular characteristics of the component and mathematical relations which describe the physical processes. The result of the modeling process is the computation of stream flow by hydrographs at desired locations in the stream basin. 
    The model can be used in making flood predictions from rainfall run-off for any state of upstream urbanization. 
    In so doing, the model considers time of concentration and detention characteristics of the tributary area. The model can also be used to estimate the velocity of surface water but cannot be used to determine backwater-curve elevations. A hydraulic computer program (HEC-2) is generally used in conjunction with HEC-1 to obtain backwater curves or surface-water profiles. 
    The model can be used to develop discharge-frequency curve and associated levels of confidence through sensitivity analysis of rainfall and run-off parameter input. 
    "Hydraulic Engineer Center Model 2 (HEC-2). This model is intended for calculating water-surface profiles for steady, gradually varied flow in natural or man-made channels. Both subcritical and supercritical flow profiles can be calculated. The effects of various obstructions such as bridges, culverts, weirs, and structures in the floodplain may be considered in the computations. The computational procedure is based on the solution of the one-dimensional energy equation with energy loss due to friction evaluated with Manning's equation. The computational procedure is generally known as the standard step method. The program is also designed for application in floodplain management and flood-insurance studies to evaluate floodway encroachments and the designate flood-hazard zones. Also, capabilities are available for assessing the effects of channel improvements and levees on water-surface profiles. 
    "Hydraulic Engineering Center Water Resources Council Model CPD-13." This model is used in calculating the flood-frequency curve from data over a period of time from stream-gauge history of sufficient length (at least ten years). The model is capable of developing confidence limits associated with the frequency curve. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest flood of the lowest enclosed area, including a basement and garage. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain-management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Scenic or riparian corridor" includes areas that border segments of seasonal creeks which contain vegetation natural to waterways. 
    "Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1-30, VE, or V. 
    "Standard protection flood" is the largest flood that can be expected from the most severe combination of meteorological and hydrological conditions reasonably characteristic of the geographical region involved. Such a flood provides a reasonable upper limit to be considered in designing flood-control works, in delineating floodplain limits, and shall be generally applicable where its occurrence would have a high probability of hazard to human life. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; not does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    The term does not, however, include either: 
A.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
B.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Velocity of water" is the rate of flow measured in feet per second at specified depths within the floodway, flood fringe, or area immediately adjacent to a proposed floodplain encroachment. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain-management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.030 - Applicability. 
    The regulations of this chapter provide seven levels of protection within and along waterways of the FP combining district by (1) generally prohibiting development within the floodway; (2) allowing only limited use and development in the floodway fringe; (3) regulating uses and development in properties contiguous to the flood fringe and outside of the floodplain, which do not meet the minimum protection standards; (4) reviewing proposed development located in designated scenic corridors; (5) reviewing all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; (6) reviewing all permits to determine that the site is reasonably safe from flooding; and (7) reviewing all development permits to determine if the proposed development adversely affects the flood-carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. 
    Accordingly, the regulatory scope of this chapter is as follows: 
A.  These regulations and standards shall be applied uniformly to all lots which, after considering evidence from flood experience and engineering studies, are deemed subject to inundation by a one-hundred-year flood, are within the FP district of the city limits and are recommended for all lots meeting the same criteria within the city's sphere of influence. 
B.  These regulations and standards shall apply to land outside of the floodplain but within the FP district if the planning commission determines that the proposed development or use of the property bears relationship to the floodplain, has an unprotected finished floor level of less than two feet above the one-hundred-year flood elevation, may adversely affect a designated scenic corridor, or where a potential of bank undermining exists. 
C.  Ensure that floodplain development does not unnecessarily adversely affect a scenic corridor, or riparian habitat. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.040 - General provisions. 
A.  Except as provided for in this chapter, all development and uses in the base floodplain, including grading and fill, are prohibited without approval, as specified in this chapter. 
B.  Any development within the floodplain shall comply with the standards of Section 60.3(a, b, c, and d) and Section 60.6(a) of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59), incorporated in this chapter by reference; the development standards of this chapter; and any conditions of approval applied to the development. 
C.  Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and the conflict cannot be attributed to fill materials being deposited to alter the elevations, the planning commission may make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundary of the floodway and flood fringe consistent with the purpose of this chapter. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such appeals shall be reviewed consistent with the variance and exception procedures to Title 44, Section 60.6 of the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59, etc.). All costs for information necessary to make an interpretation shall be borne by the property owner and shall follow the procedures listed in Section 18.47.100. 
D.  Backwater areas along streams, which rise or fall with the level of water in the adjacent stream are considered to be within the base floodplain of the adjacent creek or stream unless proven by a registered hydrologist/engineer that these water levels are not the same level as the base flood of the adjacent stream and may have a base floodplain of their own. 
E.  Encroachment into floodplains shall not cause the water velocity of the base flood to exceed two feet per second, as measured at the closest point to the proposed encroachment or any existing structures where the depth is two feet; nor shall water velocities be made sufficient to carry obstructions into the floodway; nor shall the base-flood elevation, as a product of encroachment, be raised by more than three inches from encroachment on one side only or more than six inches taking into consideration encroachment on both sides. 
F.  All floodplain elevations shall include run-off from future upstream urbanization and shall assume equal encroachment on both sides of a stream. 
G.  When base-flood elevation data has not been provided by federal, state, or local agencies, the owner shall be responsible for obtaining the information in accordance with Section 18.47.110. 
H.  Certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, flood-proofed elevation, or the elevation of the structure's lowest horizontal member, is required at the time when the footings are set and slab poured. Failure to submit elevation certification shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for a project. As-built plans certifying the elevation of the lowest adjacent grade are required to be submitted to the building official. 
I.  The building official and city engineer will review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.050 - Uses prohibited in a flood fringe area. 
    The following uses in a flood fringe area are prohibited unless the area is raised to a height of one foot above the estimated base-flood elevation based upon an approved application for encroachment: 
A.  The storage of processing of materials that, in time of flooding, are buoyant or explosive; that could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life; or that may unduly affect the capacity of the floodway or unduly increase flood heights. 
B.  Mobile homes, manufactured homes. This prohibition also applies to trailers, campers, and similar vehicles when placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. 
C.  Underground storage of toxic or flammable substances that would be injurious to human, animal, or plant life.

C.  Removal of water-deposited debris that could result in channel alteration subject to obtaining a grading permit and any permits from the Department of Fish and Game. 
D.  Maintenance and repair to existing structures and yards and normal maintenance of existing channels, ditches, or levees. 
E.  Bridges with a design capacity to pass a one-hundred-year flood without impedance of base-flood waters, taking into consideration full urbanization of the tributary area. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.070 - Permitted uses within the FP district, outside the floodway and the flood fringe. 
    The following uses are permitted without a use permit in the FP district for the area outside of the flood fringe: 
    Any permitted use in the district combined with the FP district, provided there is not any encroachment into the floodplain. The minimum setback from creeks shall be fifteen feet. The finished floor elevation of any habitable structure shall be one foot above the base floodplain elevation, as identified by FEMA, and the structure shall have year-round access not subject to inundation by a base flood of a depth of more than one foot. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.080 - Uses requiring a use permit within the flood fringe. 
    The following uses may be permitted by use permit in the FP district for the area outside of the floodway, provided such uses meet the standards of Section 18.47.090: 
A.  Flood-control project; 
B.  Gravel and sand-extraction operations when a riparian and fishery reclamation plan has been approved by the planning commission and necessary permits have been obtained from the State Department of Fish and Game and the Army Corps of Engineers, provided such operations will not broaden the floodplain nor direct flood flows out of the natural floodplain; 
C.  Public parks, picnic areas, playgrounds, boat launch, equestrian, pedestrian and bicycle trails, and golf courses which involve only the open use of land without permanent structures and which do not impede flood flows; 
D.  Water-related recreational uses not exceeding thirty consecutive days in any one year, excluding recreational uses that create noise levels exceeding a fifteen-minute leq of sixty dbA adjacent to the nearest residential property boundary, which would create permanent improvements or would result in destruction of banks; 
E.  Underground utilities including sewer, water, electric, telephone, and cable lines properly floodproofed. Overhead electric lines greater than twelve kV; 
F.  Agriculture and hobby farming including field crops, orchards, vineyards, and grazing;

3.  The use is consistent with the zoning of the parcel, 
4.  Adequate floodproofing and/or flood-protection measures have been installed meeting with the approval of the city's engineer, chief building official, and fire marshal, and planning commission. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.090 - Construction standards. 
    Any structures or construction activities within the flood fringe or floodway shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Construction, General. No construction or grading is to limit the capacity of the floodway or increase the elevation of the base-flood surface by more than one-half foot, assuming equal encroachment on both sides or more than three inches from encroachment on one side only. All structures are to be located outside the floodway. 
B.  Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
C.  Construction Materials and Methods. 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall use methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
3.  All nonstructural elements that function as a part of the structure, such as furnace, hot-water heater, air conditioner, etc., shall be elevated to one foot above the base-flood elevation or depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
D.  Elevation and Floodproofing. 
1.  New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor elevated six inches above the base-flood elevation and the finished floor elevation shall be one foot above the base-flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor. The certification shall then be submitted to the building official, who shall then verify that certification requirements have been met. 
2.  If there is not a depth number on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the base-flood elevation, then the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor shall be elevated six inches above the calculated base-flood elevation. Nonhabitable structures will meet standards in subsection (D)(3) of this section. Upon completion of the structure, evidence of compliance to the elevation requirement shall be submitted to the building official, which shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor. 
3.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (D)(1) or (D)(2) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed to the base-flood elevation, including the following standards: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below the base-flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the city's building department. 
E.  Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to the flooding shall be provided, or the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or 
2.  Be certified to comply with a local flood-proofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
F.  Standards for Utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from systems into floodwaters. 
2.  On-site waste-disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
G.  Standards for Levees. Design criteria for levees shall incorporate adequate design and operation and maintenance systems to provide protection from the base flood. The following requirements must be met: 
    Freeboard. Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An additional one foot above the minimum is required within one hundred feet in either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the minimum at the downstream end of the levee, is also required. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.100 - Existing parcels. 
    Existing parcels which at the time of the effective date of this chapter, fall wholly within a floodplain, or which have a residual area outside of the floodplain which by itself, does not meet the minimum lot size for the zoning district in which it is located or is less than five thousand square feet, whichever is less, may seek relief as follows: 
A.  Petition to encroach into the flood fringe pursuant to Section 18.47.110; 
B.  Seek a use permit to reduce any required setback by fifty percent, provided the floodplain area is placed in an open-space easement or dedicated to the city; 
C.  Offer to dedicate the flood-fringe area to the city council in exchange for a dwelling-unit credit at a ratio of one unit per ten acres dedicated. Floodplain areas claimed by the state of California are not eligible for a dwelling-unit credit. If the city council approves the exchange, the dwelling-unit credit could then be added to the density of any subdivided residential property of five acres or more in the city, subject to the following: 
1.  Any dwelling-unit credit must be used within five years of the date approved by the city council. 
2.  The density of the recipient property is not increased by more than twenty percent above what the Corning general plan otherwise would allow. 
3.  The dwelling-unit credit would not change the intended use shown by the general plan. For example, single family would not be multiple family. 
4.  The development of the recipient property meets all other standards of the city pertaining to the property. 
5.  The dwelling-unit credit is not in addition to any other bonus-density provisions sought for the property. 
6.  Any dwelling-unit credit shall be in the form of a recorded agreement. 
D.  The fringe area shall be calculated as follows: 
    The base-floodplain elevation and the edge of floodway shall be plotted on a one to four foot interval contour map of the property. The area then bonded by the edge of the floodway, edge of the base floodplain and property lines shall then be planimetered to calculate the flood fringe. That number shall then be divided by ten and reduced to the nearest whole number. In the event the flood-fringe area is less than ten acres, one dwelling unit credit can be given. 
E.  Areas that are surrounded by floodway are not considered eligible for density credit. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.110 - Application for encroachment into the flood fringe. 
A.  Property owners requesting permission to encroach into the flood fringe shall submit to the planning commission a hydraulic assessment of the base-flood event prepared by a hydrologist who is a registered civil engineer. The cost of evaluating the analysis by the city or its consultant will be the responsibility of the applicant. The assessment shall meet the requirements for surveying, hydraulic analysis, and flood-flow frequency analysis, as outlined in the Guidelines for Contractors prepared by FEMA, dated September 1982 or as subsequently amended. The city shall specify the hydraulic method and model to be used. Acceptable models for water-surface profiles include the latest version of the HEC-2. The city shall also require that calculations include the runoff from projected upstream urbanization of the tributary area, which may be obtained from the HEC-1 hydrograph model. 
B.  The assessment shall include a flood-flow frequency analysis obtained from HECWRC Program Model (CPD 13) and, when there is insufficient gauged-flood history, then frequency analysis and associated levels of confidence shall be developed through sensitivity analysis of rainfall and runoff parameters impacts using HEC-1. The results of the base-flood event and resulting surface-water analysis shall be compared with a frequency chart using a ninety-percent confidence limit and curves of standard deviations from the mean versus the frequency exceedance range showing bands of confidence ranging from .05-.95. 
C.  The assessment shall also include calculations and cross sections with a minimum interval of one hundred feet or less based on one-foot contour intervals and shall be submitted in a format for review by the city, relative to FEMA Flood Insurance Study Guidelines. Additional information may also be required by the city as necessary to make a final determination. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.120 - Equal encroachment. 
    All requests for encroachments into a floodplain shall assume equal encroachment on both sides of a stream, unless it can clearly be determined that the opposite bank above the base-floodplain elevation which would be affected is unusable and not subject to erosion, undercutting from increased water velocity or raised flood levels, or has been placed in a permanent open-space status to the extent that there would be no impact from an increase in the level of the base flood. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.130 - Environmental review. 
    Any application for encroachment into a flood-fringe area shall have an environmental assessment. Any encroachment which exceeds twenty thousand square feet in area, or significantly raises the projected flood levels on adjacent property, or has the potential to increase erosion, or diverts the natural flow of water, shall be subject to an environmental-impact report. The environmental-impact report shall evaluate the area needed to make a determination, taking into consideration the cumulative and long-term impact of the proposed encroachment, the relationship of the project to the purpose of this chapter, and alternatives to the proposed project. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.135 - Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated. 
    The city will notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, and assure that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.140 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. It is more probable that larger floods can and will occur, that the base flood may occur more often than the one percent frequency, and that flash floods may cause equal or greater damage. Flood heights inside the city limits may also be increased by man-made or natural causes in unincorporated areas. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.150 - Nonconforming uses to floodplains. 
    If any nonconforming use or structure within the floodway is destroyed by any means, including floods, to an extent of fifty percent or more of its value, it shall not be reconstructed. Within the flood fringe, a structure may be reconstructed pursuant to Chapter 18.58 of this code, and provided that, upon reconstruction, the structure is adequately and safely floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected in conformity with the requirements of FEMA. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.160 - Prohibitions. 
    No building permit, license, certificate, or other approval or entitlement shall be issued or given by the city or any department or employee thereof with respect to any improvement subject to design review until the design of the improvement has been approved, as provided in this chapter, and the one-hundred-year flood elevation has been determined. No certificate of use and occupancy or similar approval shall be issued or given for any improvement subject to use permit by this chapter, unless and until a representative of the planning department has certified that the improvement has been completed in accordance with the use permit approved pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. 547 §4(part), 1994). 
17.45.170 - Nuisance. 
A.  Any improvement constructed, located, repaired, altered, or maintained contrary to provisions hereof, after the effective date of this chapter, is declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. If any permit is issued based on plans or other submittals by the applicant or his/her representative which are contrary to the chapter or planning commission approval, the applicant shall be responsible for correcting any work done under such permit in order to bring it into conformance with the approved design.

17.45.180 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A.  Unless encroachment into the flood fringe has been approved by the planning commission or the city council, as the case may be, no subdivision shall be approved which creates lots that extend into any flood fringe or floodway area and no lots shall use areas subject to flooding by a base flood in order to meet minimum area requirements. The surface area of all lots in a subdivision that are not subject to flooding by a base flood shall be a minimum of one foot above the estimated base-flood elevation; and all finished floor elevations, including basements, shall be at least one foot above the estimated base-flood elevation. Both the tentative and final map for a subdivision shall show the boundary of the base flood. The boundary shall be certified by the engineer preparing the map. All final maps shall also have a warning note on the map similar to Section 18.47.140. 
B.  All final subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structures, pads, and adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood, the final pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the director of public works and shown on the map. 
C.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
D.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize floor damage.

B.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the city council. 
C.  In considering a variance application, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards, etc., specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed uses that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management for that area. 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system, and streets and bridges. 
D.  Generally, variances may only be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base-flood level, providing subsections A through F of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
E.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 18.47.190(D) and the purpose of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. 
F.  The planning director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
G.  Conditions for Variance. 
1.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
2.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base-flood discharge would result. 
3.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. Variances issued for economic considerations, aesthetics, or because variances have been used in the past, are not good and sufficient cause. 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization to the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
5.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest flood elevation below the base-flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

A.  Implement the provisions and policies of the general plan. 
B.  Provide maximum opportunities for innovative community design and site planning, consistent with orderly development and protection of the downtown business environment while allowing for new commercial growth potentials. 
C.  Improve the visual image, economic well-being and overall integrity of the Highway 99W Corridor. 
(Ord. 573 (part), 1997). 
17.53.030 - Application. 
A.  These visual design guidelines shall be applied only in the Highway 99W corridor specific plan area, which has been designated the Corning business development zone. 
B.  These visual design guidelines are to be used in conjunction with existing city regulations, including but not limited to the city's zoning ordinance and land division standards and other regulations that apply. 
C.  If any portion of these regulations are, for any reason, declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, such decisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. The city council declares that it would have enacted these regulations and each portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more portions be declared invalid and ineffective. 
(Ord. 573 (part), 1997). 
17.53.040 - Visual design guidelines. 
A.  1.  The visual design guidelines have been created to provide guidelines for the implementation of the Highway 99W corn-don specific plan. They have been designed as a companion document (Appendix D) to the specific plan and are intended to aid planners, architects, landscape architects, engineers, property owners and developers in adhering to the guidelines which will promote an improved image and character for the Highway 99W Corridor and Corning business development zone. These design guidelines will be utilized by the city staff and planning commission in reviewing projects requiring site plan review. 
2.  There are key design elements which contribute significantly to the overall visual impact of a community. These include architecture or building design and criteria which deal with signs, lighting, landscaping, parking and other details. The specific plan provides criteria for minimum design standards. This chapter addresses in general terms the long range goals of the specific plan and establishes the guidelines which can be used and expanded upon in more detail through the site plan review process. 
3.  The visual design guidelines are not intended to limit the work of designers, but to provide a flexible framework to accomplish an overriding design concept and to encourage quality development which will establish the Highway 99W corridor and Corning business development zone as a special place to work and run a business. 
B.  1.  Community Design Goals. 
a.  Create a high-quality and distinct community image and a functional and aesthetically pleasing commercial corridor; 
b.  Encourage the development of superior architectural and site planning design which, in time, will create an image for the city of Conning that attracts quality businesses and increases the market population. 
2.  Community Design Policies. 
a.  Provide an avenue for new development to complement and promote the future vision for the Highway 99W corridor; 
b.  Revitalize existing building facades and signs as well as sidewalks and parking areas; 
c.  Protect residential zones abutting the specific plan study area from incompatible commercial intrusion through the use of design techniques; 
d.  Provide for the elimination or screening of visually objectionable views such as outdoor storage, utility cabinets, trash containers, roof-mounted equipment, blank side walls, and loading areas through the implementation of the design guidelines; 
e.  Promote complementary landscape treatments throughout the study area to enhance hardscape elements, pedestrian amenities and storefronts; 
f.  Enhance and promote the creation of public space throughout the study area, through the use of street furniture, landscaping, building design and pedestrian orientation; 
g.  Design gateways or entry points which provide a sense of arrival to the study area, initiate a streetscape design theme, and provide signs to important destinations. 
3.  Community Design Implementation Measures. 
a.  Develop consistent streetscape, landscaping and building design palettes for the study area that are sensitive to the creation of a high quality image. (It is not the intent of this thematic requirement to discourage innovative or contemporary architectural expressions or to imitate the architecture of the past, but to promote the harmonious coexistence of architectural styles varying from restoration to contemporary architectural themes); 
b.  Require compliance with the design guide-lines for the Highway 99W Corridor Specific Plan study area in plans for new development or expansion or redevelopment of existing development; incorporate design as a major consideration in design review and approval; 
c.  Develop an incentive program that rewards private sector development for providing certain "extra" design and pedestrian amenities within their projects; 
d.  Provide incentives and incorporate an encouragement program to expedite removal of signs that do not conform to the regulations of this specific plan. (Participation of existing land use owners is voluntary.)

Chapter 17.60 - ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

17.60.010 - Purpose.

The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult-oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of these provisions to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult-oriented businesses in certain areas.
