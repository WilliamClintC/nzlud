PREFACE 
This Code of the City of New Haven consists of two volumes divided into five titles. Volume I has been reserved. Volume II contains Title I, the City Charter; Title II, a compilation of Special Laws affecting the City; Title III, a Code of General Ordinances; Title IV, the Building Code of the City; and Title V, the Housing Code. As expressed in Title III, section 1-1, Titles III, IV and V collectively comprise the Code of Ordinances of the City of New Haven. 
Titles III, IV and V represent a new and comprehensive codification which, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included therein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. This Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as the ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. All of the ordinances have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances rewritten. 
Volume II of the Code was reprinted in 1985, and this reprinted volume merely provided a replacement volume without alteration to the contents of the Code. In 2006 the city initiated a review and recodification of selected chapters and portions of chapters of the Code under the direction of Attorney Mary F. Haddon. The publisher would like to gratefully thank Thomas W. Ude, Jr., Corporation Counsel, and Sally Brown, Deputy City Clerk, for their assistance in this project. These recodified chapters along with the remaining chapters of Volume II have been republished as a new volume in a new format of 8½ × 11 pages. This republished volume includes ordinances adopted through December 15, 2008 and replaces both previous versions of Volume II supplemented through Supplement No. 109 (old format) and Supplement No. 3 to the partially completed (new format) Volume II. 
In 2011 the parts of Titles IV and V, which were not superseded or repealed, were transferred from former Volume III to Volume II, and former Volume III discontinued. 
As it will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order where possible and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws. 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 13 is 13-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustrations: If it is desired to add new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5, the new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be inserted in their alphabetical sequence by the addition of a fractional number after the chapter number. Thus, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 13 and 14, it will be designated as Chapter 13½. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be included at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
The pagination sytem used in the republished Code is a prefex system. The number or letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the hyphen represents the number of the page in that portion. The following are typical parts of Codes of Ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Code 	CD1:1 
Code Appendix 	CDA:1 
Code Comparative Tables 	CCT:1 
Charter Index 	CHTi: 
Code Index 	CDi:1 
 
The parentheses which follow most of the sections in the Code designate the source of the material used. Where no historical citation follows a section, the provisions were officially adopted as of the date of the ordinance which adopted this codification. 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this new looseleaf system, the Code of Ordinances will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected, reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting and deleting obsolete pages. To each such amendment will be attached an editorial footnote explaining briefly the effect of the amendment on the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintaining of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing same, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The general index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
The publishers are most grateful to the Corporation Counsel, Mr. Harold M. Mulvey, the Assistant Corporation Counsel, Mr. Horace Trotta, the Assistant Director of Administration, Mr. Dennis Rezendes and the other officials and heads of the various departments for their cooperation and untiring efforts during the progress of the editorial work on the 1962 codification of the New Haven Code. Publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and C. Julian Manson, of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation. 
The 2006 republication of this Code was under direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the entire project. 
This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of New Haven.

If any such owner(s) shall neglect or refuse to comply with such Order, or to remove snow, ice or sleet from the sidewalk adjacent to their land in the manner required by Ordinance, it shall be the duty of the superintendent of streets (or such other position as may be designated by the Director or by law), at the expense of the City, to perform the things required by such Order or Ordinance, and the expense so incurred shall, from the time when such superintendent begins to act and make expense in the premises, be and continue a lien and real encumbrance in favor of said City upon such land.

H.  Special assessment liens 709 . All assessments of benefits made under this Charter shall be and remain a lien upon the property especially benefited by the public works or improvement in view of which assessments were made, but the whole amount of assessments for benefits, by reason of any such work or improvement, shall in no case exceed the cost thereof, including the damages payable; and such liens, and liens for the expenses of the laying of any sidewalk, curb by said City, or for the cleaning of any sidewalk, shall take precedence and priority of all other liens or encumbrances on the property whereon the same is imposed (except taxes and other City liens prior in date), and may be foreclosed in the same manner as though said liens were mortgages on such property in favor of said City to secure the amount of such assessment or expense; provided, that no such lien shall continue to exist longer than sixty (60) Days after such assessment shall have become payable, or, as the case may be, after such expense shall have been incurred, unless within that period a certificate of lien, in the manner and form elsewhere provided, shall be lodged with the City Clerk, to be recorded in a book kept for that purpose. When any lien is put upon any land or buildings under the Charter and bylaws of said City, such land and buildings shall be liable for the assessment and interest on the amount of such lien from the date thereof until paid, and also for the City Clerk's fee and a fee of one ($1.00) dollar for the drafting of a lien certification, and, before such lien shall be removed, such assessment, interest and fees shall be paid to the collector.

Said court may, by a committee or otherwise, inquire into the allegations of such application, and may confirm, annul or modify the assessment or other action therein complained of, or make such Order in the premises as equity may require, and may allow costs to either party at its discretion; and said court may inquire into the validity of all the proceedings upon which said assessments or other action is based. No land taken as aforesaid shall be occupied by the City until the time for taking appeals shall have expired, and until all appeals have been finally disposed of; provided, however, if the City shall, on any such appeal, if such appeal is not taken from the layout itself, file an offer to give such security as said court may require for the payment of all such damages as may be finally awarded to the appellant, said court, or in vacation, any judge thereof, after hearing the parties upon such notice as said court or judge may deem sufficient, shall proceed to fix the security to be given by said City for the payment of said damages; and when said City shall have given the security fixed as aforesaid, said City may immediately enter upon, take possession of, and use such land for the purpose or purposes for which said land is taken.

COMMENT ON THE END NOTES: 
These end-notes are prefatory in nature (Note: Don't be hoodwinked by the placement at the back of the book). They are designed to meet a couple of objectives. First, the 2013 Charter Revision represents the most comprehensive reorganization and restructuring of the Charter since the enactment of the Home rule Charter in 195_. The footnotes reference the sections of the 1993 Charter so that the reader may actually be able to reconstruct the changes. The thrust of these notes is to establish a pathway to understand and follow the transition from the current Charter to the proposed revised Charter. Furthermore, these end-notes refer to the Special Acts, other historical documents and source materials. The annotation was commenced within both budget and time constraints and should be viewed in that context. For example, if a section has no historical reference may simply mean that there was not sufficient time to burrow through all the versions of the charter or special acts to locate the historical foundation for the provision. These footnotes should not be relied upon as a definitive research tool or as the foundation for authoritative conclusions of the facts contained herein. They should be simply guideposts to the further research that will be necessary to reach any reach such conclusions or objectives.

Sec. 89. - Revenue bonds for parking facilities. 
(a)  Authorized; form. The board of aldermen is authorized to provide for the issuance of revenue bonds of the city of New Haven to finance said parking facilities. Any such revenue bonds may be issued in part for the purpose of redeeming bonds of the authority or of the city heretofore issued to finance parking facilities of the authority or for the purpose of reimbursing the city for money advanced by the city to the authority. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding six per cent per annum, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, as may be provided by the board of aldermen prior to the issuance of the bonds. The board of aldermen shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. All bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall be negotiable instruments within the meaning of the general statutes. Such bonds may be sold in such manner and for such price as said board may determine to be for the best interest of the city of New Haven, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six per cent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity or maturities of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity. 
(b)  Debt limitation. Bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall not be subject to the debt limitation prescribed by section 807 of the general statutes, as amended by section 275c of the 1953 supplement to the general statutes, [9] or to any other debt limitation applicable to the city of New Haven, and the obligation evidenced by such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of said city. 
(c)  Nature of obligation. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the city of New Haven. Said bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from the income derived from said parking facilities and, to the extent and in the manner provided in the vote authorizing said bonds, revenues derived from on-street parking meters and appropriations from the general funds of the city of New Haven and such bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to that effect. 
(d)  Security. The vote authorizing the issuance of said revenue bonds shall pledge the revenues to be received from said parking facilities for which such bonds are issued. Such vote may also provide, subject to any agreement with bondholders, for the pledging of revenues from other parking facilities and for the pledging of on-street parking meter revenues. Such vote to further effectuate the provisions of this act may contain a covenant with bondholders to maintain substantially the existing on-street parking meters and to collect the fees imposed in connection therewith. Such vote may also contain a covenant with bondholders to make annual appropriations, in amounts to be determined or limited as provided in such vote, which appropriations shall be pledged to the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due. Such vote may also provide for mortgaging such parking facilities as additional security, and may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the city of New Haven, the board of aldermen and the parking authority in relation to the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, maintenance, operation and insurance of such parking facilities, and provisions for the establishment and maintenance of appropriate sinking funds and reserves, including use of a part of the bond proceeds therefor, for the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and for the employment of necessary personnel. Except as otherwise provided in this act, the board of aldermen may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the parking facilities to such officer, bank, trust company or other fiscal agent as it may designate for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such vote shall be treated as a part of the cost of operation, provided any engineering, legal, advertising, printing or other cost incurred in relation to parking facilities which are to be financed by the issuance of revenue bonds may be paid from the proceeds of said revenue bonds. 
(e)  Other limitation. The vote providing for the issuance of revenue bonds may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the board of aldermen may deem proper.

Said authority shall also have the power to lease portions of the first floor of any parking structure or any portion of its real property rights, including air rights above or areas below any such structure not to be used for parking purposes, for commercial use where in the opinion of the authority such leasing is desirable or feasible in order to defray the expenses of the authority and thereby facilitate the erection of off-street parking structures. Any such lease of any portion of the first floor of any parking structure or any portion of real property rights, including air rights above or areas below any such structure not to be used for parking purposes, for commercial use, shall contain a provision whereby the lessee shall be obligated to make a payment in lieu of taxes to the city of New Haven for each portion of the property in the possession of the lessee. Such payment shall be based upon its assessed valuation as of June 1 of each year and shall be at the rate of the tax rate set by the board of aldermen for that year. Before making or executing any contract for the leasing of such parking facility to be used for parking purposes said parking authority shall give an opportunity for competitive bidding, under such rules and regulations as shall be provided by the ordinances of said city, unless said authority and the board of aldermen find that the marking or executing of a contract for the leasing of such parking facility without an opportunity for competitive bidding is in the public interest. In the absence of such a finding all such leases or contracts to lease shall be based on competitive bids and shall be awarded to the highest responsible bidder, provided the authority shall make a finding that the parking facility or facilities shall be self-liquidating. 
If the authority and the board of aldermen find that making or executing a contract to lease without the opportunity for competitive bidding is in the public interest and prior to making or executing a contract to lease any portion of any parking structure not required for parking purposes, said authority shall: 
(1)  Hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of New Haven, the first publication of which notice to be not less than two weeks before the date set for the hearing, and 
(2)  Subsequent to said hearing submit said contract of lease to the board of aldermen of the city of New Haven for its approval.

ARTICLE IX. - RETIREMENT PLAN FOR CITY EMPLOYEES[11] 
Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note Art. IX is derived from an ordinance enacted and effective Dec. 1 and approved Dec. 8, 1969, which ordinance in its title states it is amendatory of Special Act 379 of 1965, previously codified as Art. IX, §§ 130149, and in turn amendatory of Act 397 of 1939. In view of the fact the manner of amendment was not specified, and the fact the ordinance is a total new regulation of the subject of retirement, said ordinance has been codified as effectively superseding Act 397 of 1939, as amended by Act 379 of 1965, at the discretion of the editors. Nature and extent of the changes effected, renders detailed analysis impractical. As previously codified, Art. IX was derived from the following Special Acts in addition to Act 397 of 1939 and Act 379 of 1965: Act 418 of 1941, Act 248 of 1947, Act 456 of 1957, Act 326 of 1961 and Act 389 of 1963; also codified as part of said Art. IX was an ordinance enacted Oct. 23, approved Oct. 27, effective Oct. 1, 1967. 
Special Act 397 of 1939 contained provisions parallel to those in §§ 271290 of the Revised Charter, hence amendments to said Act 397 operated to effectively supersede said Charter sections. 
Prior provisions concerning retirement of city employees are also contained in Special Act 449 of 1931, which failed to gain approval of the board of aldermen as required by § 16 thereof; and Special Act 66 of 1937 as amended by Special Act 564 of 1937, which Acts were expressly repealed by Special Act 397 of 1939. 
Cross reference Pensions for former mayors, § 159; custodians and engineers employed after Jan. 1, 1948, declared subject to city employees' retirement fund rather than custodians' and engineers' retirement fund, § 161.

Sec. 131. - Cost-of-living adjustment. 
Effective after December 1, 1969, the monthly amounts of those service and disability annuities payable to members who retired to January 1, 1968, and the monthly benefits payable to the qualified survivors of these members who died prior to January 1, 1968, shall be increased by cost-of-living adjustments which will approximately reflect the percentage increase in the federal Consumer Price Index between the calendar year when the payments commenced in each case and the calendar year 1968. The amount of increase for each case will be determined by multiplying the monthly payment by the appropriate percentage increase set forth in the following table, except for cases where the monthly payment is for the minimum amount of $83.33 (or $1,000.00 annual) or for lesser amounts: 
Year payments commenced 	% of increase 	Year payments commenced 	% of increase 	Year payments commenced 	% of increase

1960 	17.6 	1951 	33.9 	1942 	113.4 
 
For any case with monthly payments of the minimum amount of $83.33 or less, the amount of increase will be determined by multiplying the smaller annuity which would have been provided by the regular benefit provisions, before increase to the minimum amount, by the appropriate percentage of increase from the above table. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. I, § 11; Amd. of 7-6-87)

(a)  In the event the fund merges or consolidates with, or there is a transfer of assets or liabilities to any other plan or trust, each member would (if the fund then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the fund had then terminated).

The allocation of the available assets in the fund shall be in the manner and order described in the following paragraphs. If the amounts available shall be insufficient for a complete allocation in accordance with any paragraph, such amounts shall be allocated in a uniform manner to all persons in the group mentioned in such paragraph and no allocation shall be made under any subsequent paragraph. 
(1)  First, toward the payment of that portion of a member's benefit earned to date derived from his contributions (after reduction for annuity payments), whether to the contributing members, their survivors or beneficiaries.

(3)  Third, an amount shall be allocated, which when added to the amount indicated in paragraph (1), will be sufficient to provide retirement benefits for members still in the service of the city who were eligible to retire on an early retirement date. 
(4)  Fourth, an amount shall be allocated, which when added to the amount indicated in paragraph (1), will be sufficient to provide benefits earned to date by those members who have earned ten (10) years of credited service (but are not identified in paragraphs (2) or (3)). 
(5)  Fifth, amounts then remaining shall be allocated to provide benefits for all members no provided for above. 
Amounts allocated in accordance with (1) through (5), above, may be applied in the discretion of the board to provide benefits through the purchase of paid-up annuities on an individual or group basis, through allocation of reserves within the then existing fund and/or under a separate trust instrument or through participation in any other retirement plan or by any combination of these alternative or other means.

In the event of discontinuance after ten (10) or more years of continuous service, and provided he does not qualify for greater benefits under the provisions of section 138, any terminating member who does not request a refund of his contributions will be retained as a conditional member and will be eligible for a deferred pension commencing when he attains age sixty-five (65).

Such conditional member and his survivors will not be eligible for any disability, survivorship or other benefits which are provided for regular members by other sections of this division. 
In the event of a member's or a conditional member's death, the retirement board shall pay to his beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of his total contributions over the total of any annuity payments made to him. 
In the event that a regular member is survived by a qualified widow or child or children under age eighteen (18), the retirement board shall, in lieu of such repayment of contributions, pay the survivorship benefits provided in section 139 of this division. If the total benefit payments to such member and his surviving widow and children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions, the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. 
In the event of the discontinuance of the retirement fund, each member and conditional member shall be paid an amount equal to his total contributions less any annuity payments made to him. 
In no event shall a member or a conditional member have a vested interest in the funds of the retirement system, in the amount, or any portion thereof, of the contributions of the city, or in any contribution except his own.

(f)  Reinstatement of such member's prior participating service in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe, and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three (3) per cent interest compounded annually.

The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall thereafter be entitled to any benefits for which he is eligible to receive as provided for in section 135. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 138.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1973. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 5; Amd. of 4-26-72)  
Sec. 138. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  For employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service; provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuities. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 138.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1973. 
(b)  Any member who is not otherwise eligible to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obliged to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  A member who qualifies for benefits under subsection (b) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five (65) for male members and age sixty (60) for female members, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this division, in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five (55), but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five (65) on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(d)  Early retirement option prior to July 1, 1973: Any active member who has completed twenty (20) years of continuous service may elect to receive a reduced early retirement annuity to commence at any time after he has attained his sixtieth birthday. The reduced amount of such early retirement annuity shall be actuarially equivalent to the full retirement annuity normally payable commencing at a later date when he would have first attained the regular eligibility age for retirement in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 136, and shall be determined by the retirement board on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for actuarial valuations of the retirement fund. 
(e)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1973: Any active member may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of section 136. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section 138, shall be reduced in amount by four (4) per cent for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes his earliest eligibility date for normal retirement with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 6; Amd. of 4-26-72)  
Sec. 138.1. - Additional conditions for all disability annuities approved to commence after June 30, 1973. 
Any disability annuity which is approved by the retirement board with an effective commencement date later than June 30, 1973 shall be subject to adjustment on account of the member's earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind, and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return. The reduction in his disability annuity shall equal fifty (50) per cent of any excess of his earnings in the preceding calendar year over the sum of one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1,800.00) and such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve (12) months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five. For anyone of these members whose period of credited membership shall have commenced after his fortieth birthday, the amount payable as a disability annuity (before adjustment for earnings) shall be limited to a percentage of his annual rate of pay at the time of disability; this percentage is to be determined by multiplying two (2) per cent by the number of years of membership which he could have accumulated up to his sixty-fifth birthday if he were able to continue his employment for the city until that date.

Any such widow, on her remarriage, shall receive only such benefits as are payable to her children alone. 
(b)  "Average annual pay," as used in computing survivorship benefits shall mean the average annual rate of pay received by the deceased member for the final five (5) years of his service or employment by the city, or the duration of such service or employment if less than five (5) years, subject to a maximum of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for such average annual pay. 
(c)  Upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city or who has qualified for a disability annuity or a retirement benefit by reason of age and service, a minimum monthly benefit will be paid to his qualified survivors if greater than the amount determined from the benefit table above. Said minimum monthly benefit shall be equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of the monthly annuity to which the member would have been entitled if he had been permanently disabled on the date of his death, or fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of his actual monthly annuity in the case of a member who has been receiving retirement or disability benefits from the fund. The minimum monthly benefit when payable to a qualified widow without qualified child or children in her care shall be further reduced in amount by two per cent (2%) for each year that the age of the widow is less than the age of the deceased member. 
(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section a widow who does not have children of the deceased member under eighteen years of age in her care must have resided with him, except through no fault of her own, at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of his retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the widow and children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 7)  
Sec. 140. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All members eligible under this division who were enrolled prior to December 1, 1969 shall continue to participate in the fund so long as they serve as eligible employees of the city. 
(b)  The following provisions shall apply to eligible employees whose service shall commence after December 1, 1969: 
(1)  Any employee who shall enter, or transfer to, the classified civil service prior to attainment of age fifty-five shall be required to participate in the retirement fund. 
(c)  No eligible employee entering service after December 1, 1969 shall be admitted to membership in the retirement fund unless he can complete at least ten (10) years of continuous service to qualify for a retirement annuity at his mandatory retirement age. 
(d)  In computing the benefits provided in section 138, and section 139 no credit shall be given for any period of service subsequent to January 1, 1938 for which the member has not made the contribution required for participation in the retirement fund. 
(e)  An open period of six (6) months starting December 1, 1969 is hereby established during which any eligible employee, who had not previously enrolled as a member, may make written application for membership provided his total period of continuous service will be at least ten (10) years on his mandatory retirement date. Such application should specify that his membership is to be effective either from the date of his application without payment of back contributions, or from the date on which his service commenced. On the latter basis he must agree to pay all back contributions which would have been required for his prior services with three per cent (3%) compound interest, the amount of which will be determined or estimated by the retirement board whose decision shall be final. Such payment must be made in a lump sum or in equal monthly installments of at least ten dollars ($10.00) over a period not exceeding thirty-six (36) months. Such admission to membership will entail the discontinuance of any Social Security coverage on the member's subsequent earnings. Further, any retirement or disability annuity to which he becomes entitled in accordance with section 138 will be subject to reduction by a Social Security adjustment in case he has elected retroactive membership on his prior service. This adjustment will be applied where the city has paid F.I.C.A. taxes for Social Security coverage on his prior earnings and will equal fifty per cent (50%) of a proportion of the Social Security primary benefit available to him on date of his retirement. Such proportion shall be determined as the percentage which the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from the city bears to the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from all sources since January 1, 1938. 
(f)  This open period and the provisions and requirements of paragraph (e) will also be available to any member who wishes to establish credit for any period of non-participating prior service which preceded the effective date of his membership, provided such prior period was of at least twelve months' duration. 
(g)  The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) for establishing retroactive membership credits will expire at the end of the open period on May 31, 1970. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 8; Amd. of 12-1-75)  
Sec. 141. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under section 138 and 139 credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, or the Korean War subject to the following conditions: Any member who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States or any service auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties connected with air forces, or any member who shall enter such services while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six months after the termination of such military service, shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the retirement fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 9)  
Sec. 142. - Preservation of benefits paid under previous acts. 
The provisions of this division shall not affect the benefits already in course of payment in accordance with the provisions of previous acts. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. II, § 10)  
Sec. 142.1. - Future cost-of-living adjustments. 
On July 1, 1973, and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivors' benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased, or decreased, for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the Federal Consumer Price Index. For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1973 by relating such index for the full calendar year 1972 to that for the full calendar year 1971, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of one hundred three per cent (103%) and to a minimum of ninety-seven per cent (97%); further, no adjustment will be made where the increase or decrease for the year is less than one-quarter (¼) of one per cent. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1972, the monthly payment for June 1973, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve (12) months following July 1, 1973. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payments each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost-of-living adjustments. 
(Amd. of 4-26-72) 
Editor's note The amendments of April 26, 1972 specifically amended the city employees retirement fund provisions pertaining to Local 884 by adding § 12 which, in order to conform to existing style and at the discretion of the editor, has been redesignated § 142.1 as herein set out.

(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 1)  
Sec. 144. - Determination of contributions of participating members. 
The rate of contributions shall be five per cent (5%) of pay, said percentage to be deducted from each eligible participating member's pay and transmitted to said board. Computation of the average rate for use in determining benefits under this division shall be based on the employee's basic rate of pay except that earnings including overtime if greater will be used for any year when his contributions were based on such larger amount. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 2)  
Sec. 145. - Refund of contributions or deferred pension for members withdrawing from service; refund of contributions upon death of member with no qualified survivors; effect of discontinuance of fund; nature of member's interest in fund. 
Withdrawal of contributions of a member shall not be permitted except in the event of a discontinuance of employment. In the event of such discontinuance, the retirement board shall pay upon request, to the member or to his representative, designated or otherwise, an amount equal to his total contributions to the retirement fund. In event of discontinuance after ten (10) or more years of continuous service, and provided he does not qualify for greater benefits under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 148, any terminating member who does not request a refund of his contributions will be retained as a conditional member and will be eligible for a deferred pension commencing when he attains age sixty-five. Such deferred pension shall be for an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the conditional member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, subject to a maximum of seventy per cent (70%) of such average rate of pay. Such a conditional member and his survivors will not be eligible for any disability, survivorship or other benefits which are provided for regular members by other sections of this division. In the event of a member's or a conditional member's death. the retirement board shall pay to his beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of his total contributions over the total of any annuity payments made to him. In the event that a regular member is survived by a qualified widow or child or children under age eighteen, the retirement board shall, in lieu of such repayment of contributions, pay the survivorship benefits provided in section 149 of this division. If the total benefit payments to such member and his surviving widow and children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions, the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. In the event of the discontinuance of the retirement fund each member and conditional member shall be paid an amount equal to his total contributions less any annuity payments made to him. In no event shall a member or a conditional member have a vested interest in the funds of the retirement system, in the amount, or any portion thereof, of the contributions of the city, or in any contribution except his own. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 3(b)) 
Editor's note The introductory phrase to § 3(b) provides that effective July 1, 1970, § 3(a) is repealed and § 3(b) substituted therefor, hence § 3(a) has been omitted.  
Sec. 146. - Eligibility for retirement. 
(a)  Any male member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty-five years; but at the age of seventy years (sixty-five years if he became a participating member after July 1, 1970) his retirement shall be mandatory. 
(b)  Any female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty years (sixty-five years if she became a participating member after July 1, 1970); but at the age of seventy years (sixty-five years if she became a member after July 1, 1970) her retirement shall be mandatory. 
(c)  After June 30, 1974 any male or female member who has completed thirty (30) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty (60) years. 
(d)  Any member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement on account of total permanent disability according to the provisions of section 147. 
(e)  Continuous service for the purposes of this division shall mean uninterrupted service or employment but absence from service or employment for any reason, followed by reinstatement within one year thereafter shall not be considered as breaking the continuity of the service. In the case of absence from said service or employment for more than one year, the retirement board shall determine the period within which the member may return without breaking the continuity of his service or employment. 
(f)  Reinstatement of a member in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three per cent interest compounded annually. 
(g)  In computing years of service to determine eligibility for retirement, no year shall be included in which the member has not been in actual service for at least nine (9) months. 
(h)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (g) of this section, veterans of the U.S. armed forces shall be granted credit toward the computation of their years of service to be eligible for city retirement pension for up to four years served in active duty in the U.S. armed forces. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 5; Amd. of 12-17-90, § 2) 
Editor's note Sec. 4, also outlining eligibility for retirement, provides that said section becomes null and void, effective June 30, 1970; hence the section has been omitted.  
Sec. 147. - Disability annuities. 
Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of continuous service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job shall be entitled to an annuity to be granted on the basis of the completed years of service, provided proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board, which shall cause examinations to be made by at least two impartial medical examiners. The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall thereafter be entitled to any benefits for which he is eligible to receive as provided in section 145. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 6) 
This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 148.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974.  
Sec. 148. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  For employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service; provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuitants. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 148.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974. 
(b)  Any city employee who is not otherwise eligible to receive retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obligated to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  A member who qualifies for benefits under subsection (b) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five for male members and age sixty for female members, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this plan, in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five, but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(d)  Early retirement option prior to July 1, 1974: Any active member who has completed twenty (20) years of continuous service may elect to receive a reduced early retirement annuity to commence at any time after he has attained his sixtieth birthday. The reduced amount of such early retirement annuity shall be actuarially equivalent to the full retirement annuity normally payable commencing at a later date when he would have first attained the regular eligibility age for retirement in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 146, [12] and shall be determined by the retirement board on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for actuarial valuations of the retirement fund. 
(e)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1974. Any active member may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of section 146. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section 148, shall be reduced in amount by four (4) per cent for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes his earliest eligibility date for normal retirement with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year.

Sec. 148.1. - Additional conditions for all disability annuities approved to commence after June 30, 1974. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Special Act No. 379 and any amendment thereof, the following additional conditions are to apply to all disability retirement allowances for employees which are approved to commence after June 30, 1974. The amount of each such disability pension is subject to annual adjustment on account of the member's earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind, and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return. The reduction in his disability pension shall equal fifty (50) per cent of any excess of his earnings in the preceding calendar year over the amount which a Social Security beneficiary is entitled to earn without causing a reduction of his Social Security benefits. Such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve (12) months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five (65).  
Sec. 149. - Survivorship benefits.

(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section a widow who does not have children of the deceased member under eighteen years of age in her care must have resided with him, except through no fault of her own, at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of his retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the widow and children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section.

Sec. 150. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All members eligible under this division who were enrolled prior to December 1, 1969 shall continue participation so long as they are employed by the city. Each new employee entering the service of the city under civil service tenure shall be required to participate in the retirement fund. Each other new eligible employee who enters the service of the city may elect, within the first year of his service, to participate in the retirement fund and, failing such election he shall not thereafter be admitted to said fund unless he makes an application to participate within five (5) years next following and then only with the consent of the retirement board and after having passed a physical examination to be prescribed by the retirement board. In such event he may choose to have the effective date of his entry be either the date of his application or the date following one year after the commencement of his employment, and if he shall choose the latter, he shall pay the amount which he would have been required to contribute during the interim, with interest compounded annually at three per cent (3%).

(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. III, § 9)  
Sec. 151. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under sections 148 and 149 credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, or the Korean War subject to the following conditions: Any member who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States, or any service auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties connected with the air forces, or any member who shall enter such services while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six (6) months after the termination of such military service, shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the retirement fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service.

On July 1, 1975 and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivors benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased, or decreased, for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the Federal Consumer Price Index. For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1975 by relating such index for the full calendar year 1974 to that for the full calendar year 1973, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of one hundred three per cent (103%) and to a minimum of ninety-seven per cent (97%); further, no adjustment will be made where the increase or decrease for the year is less than one-quarter (¼) of one per cent. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1974 the monthly payment for June 1975, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve (12) months following July 1, 1975. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payments each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost-of-living adjustments.

In the event of a member's death prior to the commencement of an annuity or a disability annuity, if no widow or dependent children survive, the retirement board shall pay to the member's beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to his total contributions. Upon the death of a member, after commencement of an annuity or disability annuity, the amount of any excess of such total contributions made by him over the total annuity payments made to him shall be paid to his representative designated or otherwise, except that should he be survived by minor children or a wife, they shall receive annuities in lieu of such repayment of contributions, according to the provisions of this division. If the total benefit payments to the member and his surviving widow and minor children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions, the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. In the event of the discontinuance of the retirement fund, each member shall be paid an amount equal to his total contributions. In no event shall a member have a vested interest in the funds of the retirement system, in the amount, or any portion thereof, of the contributions of the city, or in any contribution except his own.

Sec. 156. - Eligibility for retirement. 
(a)  Any male member who has completed twenty (20) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this plan at the age of sixty-five years; but at the age of seventy years, his retirement shall be mandatory. 
(b)  Any female member who has completed twenty (20) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this plan at the age of sixty years; but at the age of sixty-five years, her retirement shall be mandatory. 
(c)  After June 30, 1974 any male or female member who has completed thirty (30) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty (60) years. 
(d)  Any member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement on account of total permanent disability according to the provisions of this division. 
(e)  "Continuous service," for the purposes of this division, shall mean uninterrupted service or employment, but absence from service or employment for any reason, followed by reinstatement within one year thereafter shall not be considered as breaking the continuity of the service. In the case of absence from said service or employment for more than one year, the retirement board shall determine the period within which the member may return without breaking the continuity of his service or employment. 
(f)  Reinstatement of a member in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three per cent (3%) interest compounded annually. 
(g)  In computing years of service to determine eligibility for retirement, no year shall be included in which the member has not been in actual service for at least nine (9) months. 
(h)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (g) of this section, veterans of the U.S. armed forces shall be granted credit toward the computation of their years of service to be eligible for city retirement pension for up to four years served in active duty in the U.S. armed forces.

Sec. 157. - Disability annuities. 
Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of continuous service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job shall be entitled to an annuity to be granted on the basis of the completed years of service provided proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board, which shall cause examinations to be made by at least two impartial medical examiners. The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall be entitled to any excess of his total contributions over the amount of disability annuities paid. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. 
This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.1.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 5; Amd. of 11-29-74)  
Sec. 157.1. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 1961, for employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service; provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuitants. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.1.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974. 
(b)  Any city employee who is not otherwise eligible to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obliged to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  Early retirement option prior to July 1, 1974. A member who qualifies for benefits under subsection (b) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five for male members and age sixty for female members, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this division, in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five, but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(d)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1974. Any active member may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of section 136. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section 156, shall be reduced in amount by four (4) per cent for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes his earliest eligibility date for normal retirement with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 6; Amd. of 11-29-74)  
Sec. 157.1.1. - Additional conditions for all disability annuities approved to commence after June 30, 1974. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Special Act No. 379 and any amendment thereof, the following additional conditions are to apply to all disability retirement allowances for employees which are approved to commence after June 30, 1974. The amount of each such disability pension is subject to annual adjustment on account of the member's earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind, and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return. The reduction in his disability pension shall equal fifty (50) per cent of any excess of his earnings in the preceding calendar year over the amount which a Social Security beneficiary is entitled to earn without causing a reduction of his Social Security benefits. Such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve (12) months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five (65). 
(Amd. of 11-29-74)

Any such widow, on her remarriage, shall receive only such benefits as are payable to her children alone. 
(b)  "Average annual pay," as used in computing survivorship benefits, shall mean the average annual rate of pay received by the deceased member for the final five (5) years of his service or employment by the city, or the duration of such service or employment if less than five (5) years, subject to a maximum of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for such average annual pay. 
(c)  Upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city or who has qualified for a disability annuity or a retirement benefit by reason of age and service, a minimum monthly benefit will be paid to his qualified survivors if greater than the amount determined from the benefit table above. Said minimum monthly benefit shall be equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of the monthly annuity to which the member would have been entitled if he had been permanently disabled on the date of his death, or fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of his actual monthly annuity in the case of a member who has been receiving retirement or disability benefits from the fund. The minimum monthly benefit when payable to a qualified widow without qualified child or children in her care shall be further reduced in amount by two per cent (2%) for each year that the age of the widow is less than the age of the deceased member. 
(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section a widow who does not have children of the deceased member under eighteen years of age in her care must have resided with him, except through no fault of her own, at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of his retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the widow and children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 7)  
Sec. 157.3. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All members eligible under this division who were enrolled prior to December 1, 1969, shall be required to continue participation so long as they are employed by the city. Each new eligible employee who enters the service of the city may elect, within the first year of his service, to participate in the retirement fund and, failing such election, he shall not thereafter be admitted to said fund unless he makes an application to participate within five (5) years next following and then only with the consent of the retirement board and after having passed a physical examination to be prescribed by the retirement board. In such event he may choose to have the effective date of his entry be either the date of his application or the date following one year after the commencement of his employment, and if he shall choose the latter, he shall pay the amount which he would have been required to contribute during the interim, with interest compounded annually at three per cent (3%). No credit shall be given for service subsequent to January 1, 1938, for any period for which such employee has not made the contribution required for participation in the retirement fund. 
(b)  In no event shall an employee be admitted to membership in the retirement fund unless he can complete at least twenty (20) years of continuous service to qualify for a retirement annuity at his mandatory retirement age, unless the retirement board determines that it shall be in the best interest of the city. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 8)  
Sec. 157.4. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under sections 157.1 and 157.2 credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, or in the Korean War subject to the following conditions: Any member, who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States, or any service auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties with the air forces, or any member who entered such service while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six (6) months after the termination of such military service shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the retirement fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 9)  
Sec. 157.5. - Preservation of benefits paid under previous acts. 
The provisions of this division shall not affect benefits already in course of payment in accordance with the provisions of previous acts. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. IV, § 10)  
Sec. 157.5.1. - Future cost of living adjustments. 
On July 1, 1975 and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivors benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased, or decreased, for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the Federal Consumer Price Index. For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1975 by relating such index for the full calendar year 1974 to that for the full calendar year 1973, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of one hundred three per cent (103%) and to a minimum of ninety-seven per cent (97%); further, no adjustment will be made where increase or decrease for the year is less than one-quarter (¼) of one per cent. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1974 the monthly payment for June 1975, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve (12) months following July 1, 1975. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payments each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost-of-living adjustments.

Editor's note The amendments of Nov. 29, 1974 specifically amended the city employees retirement fund provisions pertaining to Local 713 by adding § 12 to Art. IV which, in order to conform to existing style and at the editor's discretion, has been codified as § 157.5.1 as herein set out.  
DIVISION 5. - PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY LOCAL 217 OF THE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AND BARTENDERS UNION, AFL-CIO 
 
Sec. 157.6. - Definitions.

Local 217 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees, and Bartenders Union, AFL-CIO or Local 217 members means all the non-professional board of education cafeteria employees, including probationary employees, of the City of New Haven, for whom Local 217 or its successor has a legal responsibility to represent according to Public Act 159 as amended of the State of Connecticut 1965 General Assembly. New employees holding positions under new classifications, which shall come under the representation of Local 217 or its successor in the future, shall also accrue the terms and benefits of this division. All full-time employees who work twenty (20) hours or more per week, and who are otherwise eligible in accordance with the provisions of Special Act 379, may join the retirement plan of the city. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 1; Amd. of 1-3-75)  
Sec. 157.7. - Determination of contributions of participating members. 
The rate of contributions shall be five per cent (5%) of pay, said percentage to be deducted from each eligible participating member's pay and transmitted to said board. Computation of the average rate for use in determining benefits under this division shall be based on the employee's basic rate of pay except that total earnings including overtime if greater will be used for any year when his contributions were based on such larger amounts. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 2)  
Sec. 157.8. - Provision for refund of contributions or deferred pensions for members withdrawing from service; provision for refund of contributions upon death of member with no qualified survivors; effect of discontinuance of fund; nature of member's interest in fund. 
Withdrawal of contributions of a member shall not be permitted except in the event of discontinuance of employment. In the event of such discontinuance, the retirement board shall pay, upon request, to the member or to his representative, designated or otherwise, an amount equal to his total contributions to the retirement fund. In the event of discontinuance after the member has made contributions for ten (10) or more years and provided he does not qualify for greater benefits under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 157.11, any terminating member who does not request a refund of his contributions will be retained as a conditional member and will be eligible for a deferred pension commencing on the earliest date on which the member would have become eligible for normal retirement if he had continued in active service. Such deferred pension shall be for an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the conditional member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, subject to a maximum of seventy per cent (70%) of such average rate of pay. Such conditional member and his survivors will not be eligible for any disability, survivorship or other benefits which are provided for regular members by other sections of this article. In the event of a member's or a conditional member's death, the retirement board shall pay to his beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of his total contributions over the total of any annuity payments made to him. In the event that a regular member is survived by a qualified widow or child or children under age eighteen (18), the retirement board shall, in lieu of such repayment of contributions, pay the survivorship benefits provided in section 157.12 of this division. If the total benefit payments to such member and his surviving widow and children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions, the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. In the event of the discontinuance of the retirement fund, each member and conditional member shall be paid an amount equal to his total contributions less any annuity payments made to him. In no event shall a member or a conditional member have a vested interest in the funds of the retirement system, in the amount, or any portion thereof, of the contributions of the city, or in any contribution except his own.

(b)  Any female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty (60) years (sixty-five (65) years if she became a participating member after July 1, 1974); but, at the age of seventy (70) years (sixty-five (65) years if she became a participating member after July 1, 1974) her retirement shall be mandatory. 
(c)  After June 30, 1974 any male or female member who has completed thirty (30) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty (60) years. 
(d)  Any member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement on account of total permanent disability according to the provisions of section 157.10. 
(e)  "Continuous service," for the purposes of this division, shall mean uninterrupted service or employment, but absence from service or employment for any reason, followed by reinstatement within one year thereafter shall not be considered as breaking the continuity of the service. In the case of absence from said service or employment for more than one year, the retirement board shall determine the period within which the member may return without breaking the continuity of his service or employment. 
(f)  Reinstatement of such member's prior participating service in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three per cent (3%) interest compounded annually. Application for such reinstatement shall be made within six (6) months after the employee's return to employment. 
(g)  In computing years of service to determine eligibility for retirement, no year shall be included in which the member has not been in actual service for at least eight (8) months.

Sec. 157.10. - Disability annuities. 
Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of continuous service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job shall be entitled to an annuity to be granted on the basis of the completed years of service, provided proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board, which shall cause examinations to be made by at least two impartial medical examiners. The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall be entitled to any excess of his total contributions over the amount of disability annuities paid. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the condition set forth in section 157.11.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 5; Amd. of 1-3-75)  
Sec. 157.11. - Retirement and disability benefits.

Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuitants. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.11.1 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than June 30, 1974. 
(b)  Any city employee who is not otherwise eligible to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obliged to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  A member who qualifies for benefits under subsection (b) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five for male members and age sixty for female members, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this plan, in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five, but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(d)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1974. Any active member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsection (a), (b) or (c) of section 157.9. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section 157.11, shall be reduced in amount by four (4) per cent for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes his earliest eligibility date for normal retirement with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 6; Amd. of 1-3-75)  
Sec. 157.11.1. - Additional conditions for all disability annuities approved to commence after June 30, 1974. 
Any disability annuity which is approved by the retirement board with an effective commencement date later than June 30, 1974 shall be subject to adjustment on account of the member's earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind, and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return. The reduction in his disability annuity shall equal fifty per cent (50%) of any excess of his earnings in the preceding calendar year over the amount which a Social Security beneficiary is entitled to earn without causing a reduction of his Social Security benefits. Such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve (12) months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five (65). For any one of these members whose period of credited membership shall have commenced after his fortieth birthday the amount payable as a disability annuity (before adjustment for earnings) shall be limited to a percentage of his annual rate of pay at the time of disability; this percentage is to be determined by multiplying two per cent (2%) by the number of years of membership which he could have accumulated up to his sixty-fifth birthday if he were able to continue his employment for the city until that date.

Sec. 157.12. - Survivorship benefits. 
(a)  On and after the effective date of this division, upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has participated in the retirement fund for a period of not less than six (6) months or who had been retired by reason of age and service, or by reason of disability, there shall be paid to or on account of his or her surviving child or children under eighteen years of age, and in the case of a male member, to his qualified widow, monthly benefits consistent with the following table:

Any such widow, on her remarriage, shall receive only such benefits as are payable to her children alone. 
(b)  "Average annual pay," as used in computing survivorship benefits shall mean the average annual rate of pay received by the deceased member for the final five (5) years of his service or employment by the city, or the duration of such service or employment if less than five (5) years, subject to a maximum of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for such average annual pay. 
(c)  Upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city or who has qualified for a disability annuity or a retirement benefit by reason of age and service, a minimum monthly benefit will be paid to his qualified survivors if greater than the amount determined from the benefit table above. Said minimum monthly benefit shall be equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of the monthly annuity to which the member would have been entitled if he had been permanently disabled on the date of his death, or fifty per cent (50%) of the amount of his actual monthly annuity in the case of a member who has been receiving retirement or disability benefits from the fund. The minimum monthly benefit when payable to a qualified widow without qualified child or children in her care shall be further reduced in amount by two per cent (2%) for each year that the age of the widow is less than the age of the deceased member. 
(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section a widow who does not have children of the deceased member under eighteen years of age in her care must have resided with him, except through no fault of her own, at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of his retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the widow and children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 7)  
Sec. 157.13. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All members eligible under this division who were enrolled prior to December 1, 1969 shall be required to continue participation so long as they are employed by the city. Each new eligible employee who enters the service of the city may elect, within the first year of his service, to participate in the retirement fund and, failing such election, he shall not thereafter be admitted to said fund unless he makes the application to participate within five (5) years next following and then only with the consent of the retirement board and after having passed a physical examination to be prescribed by the retirement board. In such event he may choose to have the effective date of his entry be either the date of his application or the date following one year after the commencement of his employment, and if he shall choose the latter, he shall pay the amount which he would have been required to contribute during the interim, with interest compounded annually at three per cent (3%). No credit shall be given for service subsequent to January 1, 1938, for any period for which such employee has not made the contribution required for participation in the retirement fund. 
(b)  In no event shall an employee be admitted to membership in the retirement fund unless he can complete at least ten (10) years of continuous service to qualify for a retirement annuity at his mandatory retirement age. 
(c)  An open period of six (6) months starting on the date that the contract is signed is hereby established during which any eligible employee, who had not previously enrolled as a member, may make written application for membership provided he can complete at least ten (10) years of continuous service before he attains age sixty-five (65). Such application should specify that his membership is to be effective either from the date of his application without payment of back contributions provided his present age is less than fifty-five (55), or from the date on which his service commenced. On the latter basis he must agree to pay all back contributions which would have been required for his prior services with three per cent (3%) compound interest, the amount of which will be determined or estimated by the retirement board whose decision shall be final. Such payment must be made in a lump sum or in equal monthly installments of at least ten dollars ($10.00) over a period not exceeding thirty-six (36) months. Such admission to membership will entail the discontinuance of any Social Security coverage on the member's subsequent earnings. Further, any retirement or disability annuity to which he becomes entitled in accordance with section 157.11 will be subject to reduction by a Social Security adjustment in case he has elected retroactive membership on his prior service. This adjustment will be applied where the city has paid F.I.C.A. taxes for Social Security coverage on his prior earnings and will equal fifty per cent (50%) of a proportion of the Social Security primary benefit available to him on date of his retirement. Such proportion shall be determined as the percentage which the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from the city bears to the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from all sources since January 1, 1938. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 8; Amd. of 1-3-75 eff. 7-1-74)  
Sec. 157.14. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under sections 157.11 and 157.12 credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, or the Korean War subject to the following conditions: Any member who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States, or any auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties connected with the air forces, or any member who shall enter such services while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six (6) months after the termination of such military service, shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the retirement fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 9)  
Sec. 157.15. - Preservation of benefits under previous plans. 
The provisions of this division shall not affect benefits already in course of payment in accordance with the provisions of previous plans. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. V, § 10)  
Sec. 157.15.1. - Future cost-of-living adjustments. 
On July 1, 1975, and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivors' benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased, or decreased, for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the Federal Consumer Price Index. For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1975 by relating such index for the full calendar year 1974 to that for the full calendar year 1973, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of one hundred three per cent (103%) and to a minimum of ninety-seven per cent (97%); further, no adjustment will be made where the increase or decrease for the year is less than one-quarter (¼) of one per cent. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1974, the monthly payment for June 1975, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve (12) months following July 1, 1975. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payments each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost-of-living adjustments.

In the event of a member's death prior to the commencement of an annuity or a disability annuity, if no widow or dependent children survive, the retirement board shall pay to the member's beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to his total contributions. Upon the death of a member, after commencement of an annuity or disability annuity, the amount of any excess of such total contributions made by him over the total annuity payments made to him shall be paid to his representative designated or otherwise, except that should he be survived by minor children or a wife, they shall receive annuities in lieu of such repayment of contributions, according to the provisions of this plan. If the total benefit payments to the member and his surviving widow and minor children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions, the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. In the event of the discontinuance of the retirement fund, each member shall be paid an amount equal to his total contributions.

In the case of absence from said service or employment for more than one year, the retirement board shall determine the period within which the member may return without breaking the continuity of his service or employment. 
(e)  Reinstatement of a member in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three per cent (3%) interest compounded annually.

Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of continuous service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job shall be entitled to an annuity to be granted on the basis of the completed years of service, provided proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board, which shall cause examinations to be made by at least two impartial medical examiners. The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall be entitled to any excess of his total contributions over the amount of disability annuities paid. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VI, § 5)  
Sec. 157.21. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 1961, for employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuitants. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. 
(b)  Any city employee who is not otherwise eligible to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obliged to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  A member who qualifies for benefits under subsection (b) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five for male members and age sixty for female members, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this plan, in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five, but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund.

(b)  Any female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this article at the age of sixty (60) years (sixty-five (65) years if she became a participating member after September 1, 1967); but, at the age of seventy (70) years (sixty-five (65) years if she became a member after September 1, 1967) her retirement shall be mandatory unless she is a paid full-time elected officer. 
(c)  After June 30, 1973 any male or female member who has completed thirty (30) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty (60) years. 
(d)  Any member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city shall be eligible for retirement on account of total permanent disability according to the provisions of section 157.30. 
(e)  "Continuous service," for the purposes of this division, shall mean uninterrupted service or employment, but absence from service or employment for any reason, followed by reinstatement within one year thereafter shall not be considered as breaking the continuity of the service. In the case of absence from said service or employment for more than one year, the retirement board shall determine the period within which the member may return without breaking the continuity of service or employment. 
(f)  Reinstatement of such member's prior participating service in the retirement fund shall be conditioned upon such medical examination as the retirement board may prescribe and upon payment to the retirement fund of contributions previously withdrawn with three per cent (3%) interest compounded annually. Application for such reinstatement shall be made within six (6) months after his return to employment. 
(g)  In computing years of service to determine eligibility for retirement, no year shall be included in which the member has not been in actual service for at least nine (9) months. 
(h)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (g) of this section, veterans of the U.S. armed forces shall be granted credit toward the computation of their years of service to be eligible for city retirement pension for up to four years served in active duty in the U.S. armed forces. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 4; Amd. of 12-1-75; Amd. of 12-17-90, § 6)  
Sec. 157.30. - Disability annuities. 
Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of continuous service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job shall be entitled to an annuity to be granted on the basis of the completed years of service, provided proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board, which shall cause examinations to be made by at least two impartial medical examiners. The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled and such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, said board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member and he shall thereafter be entitled to any benefit for which he is eligible to receive as provided for in sections 157.28 and 157.31. If such disability is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment by the city as defined by the workmen's compensation act, a member of the fund shall be eligible for retirement irrespective of the duration of his employment. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.32 for any member whose participation in the retirement fund commences after January 1, 1970. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 5)  
Sec. 157.31. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 1969, for employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two per cent (2%) of the member's average rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service; provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or eighty per cent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuitants. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the workmen's compensation act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of continuous service, provided such disability was not incurred as the result of any other gainful employment shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.32 for any member whose participation in the retirement fund commences after January 1, 1970. 
(b)  Any city employee who is not otherwise eligible to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service, is obliged to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service for each full year of service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty per cent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said last five (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes written application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(c)  Any paid full-time elected official whose period in office expires, or any paid full-time elected or appointed official whose service is terminated involuntarily, not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, after completion of ten (10) years of service and attainment of the age of forty-five shall subsequently receive, commencing upon the attainment of the age of sixty or upon qualification for disability annuity according to the provisions of this division, an annuity for life equal to forty per cent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two per cent (2%) of such average annual rate of pay for each full year of service in excess of ten (10) years, provided such annuity shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. 
(d)  A member who qualifies for benefits under either of the two preceding subsections and who has at least twenty-five years of service may elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five for male members and age sixty for female members, or upon qualification for disability annuity according to the provisions of this division, in an amount determined as two percent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service for each year of his total service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five, but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(e)  Early retirement option prior to July 1, 1973. Any active or conditional member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service may elect to receive a reduced early retirement annuity to commence at any time after he has attained his sixtieth birthday. The reduced amount of such early retirement annuity shall be actuarially equivalent to the full retirement annuity normally payable commencing at a later date when he would have first attained the regular eligibility age for retirement in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 157.29, and shall be determined by the retirement board on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for actuarial valuations of the retirement fund. 
(f)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1973. Any active or conditional member may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of section 157.29. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section 157.31, shall be reduced in amount by four percent (4%) for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes his earliest eligibility date for normal retirement with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 6; Amd. of 12-1-75)  
Sec. 157.32. - Additional conditions for disability annuities for members enrolled after January 1, 1970. 
The disability annuity payable to any member whose participation in the retirement fund commences after January 1, 1970 shall be adjusted by an amount equal to a percentage of his earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind; and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return; the percentage of his earnings, if any, for the preceding calendar year to be deducted from his disability annuity will be determined by the ratio of his disability annuity (before adjustment) to his annual rate of pay at the time of disability, and the amount of such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five. For any one of these members whose period of credited membership shall have commenced after his fortieth birthday the amount payable as a disability annuity (before adjustment for earnings) shall be limited to a percentage of his annual rate of pay at the time of disability; this percentage is to be determined by multiplying two percent (2%) by the number of years of membership which he could have accumulated up to his sixty-fifth birthday if he were able to continue his employment for the city until that date. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 7)  
Sec. 157.33. - Survivorship benefits. 
(a)  On and after the effective date of this division upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has participated in the retirement fund for a period of not less than six (6) months or who had been retired by reason of age and service, or by reason of disability, there shall be paid to or on account of his or her surviving child or children under eighteen years of age, and, in the case of a male member, to his qualified widow, monthly benefits consistent with the following table:

_____
Any such widow, on her remarriage, shall receive only such benefits as are payable to her children alone. 
(b)  "Average annual pay," as used in computing survivorship benefits shall mean the average annual rate of pay received by the deceased member for the final five (5) years of his service or employment by the city, or the duration of such service or employment if less than five (5) years, subject to a maximum of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for such average annual pay. 
(c)  Upon the death of a male or widowed female member who has completed ten (10) years of continuous service for the city or who has qualified for a disability annuity or a retirement benefit by reason of age and service, a minimum monthly benefit will be paid to his qualified survivors if greater than the amount determined from the benefit table above. Said minimum monthly benefit shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the monthly annuity to which the member would have been entitled if he had been permanently disabled on the date of his death, or fifty percent (50%) of the amount of his actual monthly annuity in the case of a member who has been receiving retirement or disability benefits from the fund. The minimum monthly benefit when payable to a qualified widow without qualified child or children in her care shall be further reduced in amount by two percent (2%) for each year that the age of the widow is less than the age of the deceased member. 
(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section a widow who does not have children of the deceased member under eighteen years of age in her care must have resided with him, except through no fault of her own, at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of his retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the widow and children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 8)  
Sec. 157.34. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All management and professional members and elected or appointed officers who were enrolled in this plan prior to December 1, 1969 shall continue to participate in the fund so long as they serve as eligible employees or officers of the city in accordance with the terms and conditions then prevailing for membership. 
(b)  The following provisions shall apply to eligible elected or appointed officers and management and professional employees whose service commences after December 1, 1969: 
(1)  Any employee who shall enter, or transfer to, the classified civil service prior to attainment of age fifty-five shall be required to participate in the retirement fund. 
(2)  Each other new employee who shall be hired prior to attainment of age fifty-five (55) may elect to be enrolled as a contributing member of the fund as of the first anniversary of the date of his employment by filing a written application before that date; such participation may also include the first year of his employment if the employee elects to pay the back contributions with three percent (3%) interest compounded annually on his first anniversary date or within six (6) months of the effective date of this amendment, if later. Failing this required application, he will be continued under the Federal Social Security program which will apply to all such noncivil service employees during their first year of service unless an application for immediate participation is filed with the retirement board during his first thirty (30) calendar days of service. Such Social Security coverage will be discontinued on the employee's earnings after the first year if he makes the application required for enrollment in the retirement fund. This provision for optional participation shall also apply to each appointed officer whose service commences prior to age fifty-five (55) and to each elected officer regardless of age. 
(c)  No eligible employee or officer entering service after December 1, 1969 shall be admitted to membership in the retirement fund unless he can complete at least ten (10) years of continuous service to qualify for a retirement annuity at his mandatory retirement age. 
(d)  In computing the benefits provided sections 157.31, 151.32 and 157.33 no credit shall be given for any period of service subsequent to January 1, 1938 for which the member has not made the contribution required for participation in the retirement fund. 
(e)  An open period of six (6) months starting December 1, 1969 is hereby established during which any eligible employee or officer, who had not previously enrolled as a member, may make written application for membership provided his total period of continuous service will be at least ten (10) years on his mandatory retirement date. Such application should specify that his membership is to be effective either from the date of his application without payment of back contributions, or from the date on which his service commenced. On the latter basis he must agree to pay all back contributions which would have been required for his prior service with three percent (3%) compounded interest, the amount of which will be determined or estimated by retirement board whose decision shall be final. Such payment must be made in a lump sum or in equal monthly installments of at least ten dollars ($10.00) over a period not exceeding thirty-six (36) months. Such admission to membership will entail the discontinuance of any Social Security coverage on the member's subsequent earnings. Further any retirement or disability annuity to which he becomes entitled in accordance with sections 157.31 and 157.32 will be subject to reduction by a Social Security adjustment in case he has elected retroactive membership on his prior service. This adjustment will be applied where the city has paid F.I.C.A. taxes for Social Security coverage on his prior earnings and will equal fifty percent (50%) of a proportion of the Social Security primary benefit available to him on the date of his retirement. Such proportion shall be determined as the percentage which the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from the city bears to the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from all sources since January 1, 1938. 
(f)  This open period and the provisions and requirements of paragraph (e) will also be available to any member who wishes to establish credit for any period of non-participating prior service which preceded the effective date of his membership, provided such prior period was of at least twelve (12) months' duration. 
(g)  The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) for establishing retroactive membership credits will expire at the end of the open period on May 31, 1970. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 9; Amd. of 12-1-75)  
Sec. 157.35. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under sections 157.31, 157.32 and 157.33 credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, or the Korean War subject to the following conditions: Any member who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States, or any auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties connected with the air forces or any member who shall enter such services while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six months after the termination of such military service, shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the retirement fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 10)  
Sec. 157.36. - Preservation of benefits under previous acts. 
The provisions of sections 157.26 through 157.35 of this division shall not affect benefits already in course of payment in accordance with the provisions of previous acts. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 11)  
Sec. 157.37. - Future cost of living adjustments. 
On July 1, 1970, and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivor's benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased or decreased for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the Federal Consumer Price Index. For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1970 by relating such index for the full calendar year 1969 to that for the full calendar year 1968, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of 103% and to a minimum of 97%; further, no adjustment will be made where the increase or decrease for the year is less than ¼ of 1%. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1969, the monthly payment for June 1970, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve months following July 1, 1970. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payment each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost of living adjustments. 
(Ord. of 12-1-69, Art. VII, § 12)

Footnotes:

In order to maintain existing Code format and at the discretion of the editor, the new provisions have been redesignated as Division 8, §§ 157.38157.49, as herein set out. 
 
Sec. 157.38. - Definitions. 
As used in this article [this division] the following term shall have the following meanings: 
Eligible employee or officer means: 
(1)  Any non-bargaining unit employee appointed to a full time general fund position, scheduled to work at least 35 hours per week and employed in one of the position titles under Section II "Executive Management and Confidential Employees Personnel Policy and Procedures" manual. 
(2)  Any non-bargaining unit employees as defined in the decision of the Connecticut State Labor Board or defined as confidential employees by the Management Union Contract and employed in a position title under Section II, "Confidential Employees of the City of New Haven Executive Management and Confidential Employees Personnel Policy and Procedures" manual. 
Specifically excluded are all those members who are eligible for retirement benefits of Articles II through VII [Divisions 2 through 7] inclusive; all positions represented by any employee organization recognized by the city and/or board of education under the Municipal Employee Relations Act (CGS 4-474 et seq.) or the Teacher Negotiations Act (CGS 153(a) et seq.); all temporary, seasonal, contractual (including board of education administrators), or part-time personnel. Eligible employees holding positions under new classifications which shall come under the category of executive management and confidential employees in the future shall also accrue the terms and benefits of this article. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.39. - Determination of contributions of participating members. 
The rate of contributions shall be six percent (6%) of pay, said percentage to be deducted from each eligible participating member's pay and transmitted to said board. Computation of the average rate for use in determining benefits under this article [this division] shall be based on such member's basic rate of pay except that total earnings including overtime, if greater, will be used for any year when such member's contributions were based on such larger amount. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.40. - Provision for refund of contributions or deferred pensions for members withdrawing from service; provisions for refund of contributions upon death of member with no qualified survivors; recovery from disability. 
Withdrawal of contributions of a member shall not be permitted except in the event of discontinuance of employment. In the event of such discontinuance, the retirement board shall pay, upon request, to the member or to his representative, designated or otherwise, an amount equal to his total contributions to the retirement fund. 
Even if no such request is made, in the event of such discontinuance before the member has earned ten (10) or more years of credited service, the retirement board, in its sole discretion, may pay to the member or to his representative, designated or otherwise, an amount equal to his total contributions to the retirement fund. 
In the event of such discontinuance after ten (10) or more years of credited service, and provided he does not qualify for greater benefits under the provisions of section 157.43, any terminating member who does not request a refund of his contributions will be retained as a conditional member and will be eligible for a deferred pension commencing when he attains age sixty-five (65) or upon such earlier date as may be elected by the member pursuant to section 157.43(e) and (f). Such deferred pension shall be for an amount determined as two percent (2%) of the conditional member's average rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of service producing the highest average, for each year of credited service, subject to a maximum of seventy percent (70%) of such average rate of pay and reduced as provided in section 157.43(d), if applicable. Such conditional member and his survivors will not be eligible for any disability, survivorship or other benefits which are provided for non-conditional members by other sections of this article [this division]. 
In the event of a member's or a conditional member's death, the retirement board shall pay to his beneficiary, or to his estate if no named beneficiary is surviving, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of his total contributions over the total of any annuity payments made to him. 
In the event that a member is survived by a widow, widower, or child or children under age eighteen (18), the retirement board shall, in lieu of such repayment of contributions, pay the survivorship benefits provided in section 157.45 of this article [this division]. If the total benefit payments to such member and his surviving widow or widower and children shall be less than the amount of his total contributions the amount of any excess shall be paid to the legal representative of the last survivor who received benefits. 
A member whose disability benefits are terminated by reason of the member's recovery shall be entitled to the benefits of this section, without regard to the amount of his credited service. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the retirement board shall not have the authority to pay any such member the amount of his total contributions to the retirement fund except upon such member's request. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.41. - Eligibility for retirement. 
(a)  Any male member who has completed ten (10) years of credited service for the city shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty-five years; but at the age of seventy years his retirement shall be mandatory. 
(b)  Any female member who has completed ten (10) years of credited service for the City shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this division at the age of sixty years (sixty-five years if she became a participating member after September 1, 1967); but at the age of seventy years her retirement shall be mandatory. 
(c)  After June 30, 1980 any (male or female) member the sum of whose age and years of credited service for the city equals or exceeds eighty-five (85) shall be eligible for retirement according to the provisions of this article [this division]. 
(d)  Any member who has completed ten (10) years of credited service for the city shall be eligible for retirement on account of total permanent disability according to the provisions of section 157.42. 
(e)  "Credited service" for the purposes of this article [this division] shall mean that number of full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis) with respect to which a member's pay is reduced by the amounts provided in section 157.39; provided, however, that the number of full and fractional years of credited service of a member as of July 1, 1986 shall not be less than the member's continuous service as of such date, as calculated pursuant to this section as if in effect on June 30, 1986. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event a member separates from the city's service and receives a refund of his contributions pursuant to section 157.40, the member's credited service shall include only those full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis), occurring after the latest such refund, with respect to which the member's pay is reduced by the amounts provided in section 157.39, unless: 
(1)  The member, within six (6) months of his return to the city's service, requests a reinstatement of his prior credited service, if any; and 
(2)  The member's prior credit service calculated as of the date of the latest refund exceeds the number of full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis) falling between the date the member last separated from the city's service and the date first following such separation on which the member contributed to the fund pursuant to section 157.39; 
(3)  The member repays the latest refund together with three percent (3%) interest compounded annually; and 
(4)  The member passes such medical examinations as the retirement board, in its sole discretion, shall prescribe. The retirement board shall have the sole discretion to determine whether the member has passed such medical examinations, and its decision shall be final and conclusive on all parties. 
In the event a member satisfies all of the foregoing conditions, his credited service shall consist of those full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis) occurring after the latest such refund with respect to which the member's pay is reduced by the amounts provided in section 157.39 plus his prior credited service. 
For purposes of this section the term "prior credited service" shall mean those full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis) with respect to which the latest refund was made. 
(g)  "Credited service" shall also include those full and fractional years (calculated on a daily basis) during which a member receives a disability benefit, provided such member recovers from such disability, is rehired by the city and thereafter earns at least five (5) years of credited service. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.42. - Disability annuities. 
Any member of the retirement fund who, after ten (10) years of credited service for the city, is permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job; or, irrespective of the duration of his employment, suffers such a disability which is shown to the satisfaction of the board to have arisen out of or in the course of his employment by the city, as defined in the Worker's Compensation Act, shall be entitled to an annuity in an amount determined pursuant to section 157.43; provided satisfactory proof of such disability shall be submitted to the retirement board. 
The retirement board shall cause examinations to be made by at least two (2) impartial medical examiners initially to verify the existence of such disability. 
The retirement board may, from time to time, call for similar medical evidence that the member continues to be permanently disabled. Such member shall be required to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the retirement board. If the retirement board, upon competent medical evidence, concludes that the disability for which the member is receiving an annuity no longer exists, such board shall thereupon order a discontinuance of all such annuities payable to such member, effective on the date which is ninety (90) days after the board concludes that the disability no longer exists. Each member whose benefits are terminated in accordance with this paragraph, shall regardless of the number of his years of credited service, thereafter be entitled to those benefits provided in section 157.40. 
Disability annuity benefits shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.44 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than January 1, 1970. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.43. - Retirement and disability benefits. 
(a)  For employees retiring by reason of age and service or by reason of disability, the retirement board shall pay to each eligible member an annuity for life in an amount determined as two percent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of service producing the highest average, for each year (or fraction) of credited service; provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of his average annual rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of service producing the highest average. Such annuity shall be paid monthly at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual amount so determined. A minimum annual pension of one thousand ($1,000.00) or eighty percent (80%) of the employee's annual rate of pay at the time of his retirement, whichever is smaller, is hereby established for present and future annuities. Any pension payable by reason of disability arising out of and in the course of employment as defined in the Worker's Compensation Act or arising after the completion of ten (10) years of credited service, provided such disability was not incurred as a result of any other gainful employment, shall not be less than one-half of the member's annual rate of pay at the time of disability. This disability annuity benefit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in section 157.44 for any member whose annuity is approved by the retirement board with an effective date later than January 1, 1970. 
(b)  Any appointed official whose service is terminated involuntarily, not due to malfeasance or misfeasance in office, after completion of ten (10) years of service and attainment of the age of forty-five shall subsequently receive, commencing upon the attainment of the age of sixty or upon qualification for disability annuity according to the provisions of this article [this division], an annuity for life equal to forty percent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay for the last five (5) years of his service, plus two percent (2%) of such average annual rate of pay for each full year of service in excess of ten (10) years, provided such annuity shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of his average annual rate of pay for his final five (5) years of service. 
(c)  Any member who is not eligible to receive a normal retirement or disability benefit under the provisions of this section and who, after reaching the age of fifty-five years and being a member of the retirement fund at the time, and after at least fifteen (15) years of credited service, is obligated to retire involuntarily from such service, which involuntary retirement is not due to malfeasance in office, shall receive an annual retirement benefit equal to forty percent (40%) of his average annual rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of service producing the highest average, plus two percent (2%) of his average annual rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of his service producing the highest average, for each full or fractional year of credited service in excess of fifteen (15) years but in no event more than fifty percent (50%) of his annual rate of pay for said (5) years of his service. This provision shall apply to any person retired on or after January 1, 1957, provided such person makes writing application to the retirement board within one year after such involuntary retirement. 
(d)  A member who qualifies for benefits under subsections (b) and (c) and who has at least twenty-five (25) years of credited service my elect an alternative benefit in the form of an annuity for life commencing at age sixty-five (65) for male and female members, but age sixty (60) for female members who became participating members prior to September 1, 1967, or upon qualification for a disability annuity according to the provisions of this article [this division], in an amount determined as two percent (2%) of the member's average annual rate of pay averaged over those five (5) years of service producing the highest average for each year of his credit service, provided such annuity shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of such average annual rate of pay and provided the member may elect to have said alternative form of annuity commence at any earlier age after the age of fifty-five (55), but in such event the amount of annuity will be reduced so as to be equivalent in present value to the annuity payable at the age of sixty-five (65) in the case of male and female members, and at age sixty (60) in the case of female members who became participating members prior to September 1, 1967 on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for determining actuarial reserves for the retirement fund. 
(e)  Early retirement option prior to July 1, 1973: Any active member who has completed ten (10) years of credited service may elect to receive a reduced early retirement annuity to commence at any time after he has attained his sixtieth birthday. The reduced amount of such early retirement annuity shall be actuarially equivalent to the full retirement annuity normally payable commencing at a later date when he would have first attained the regular eligibility age for retirement in accordance with subsection (a) and (b) of section 157.43, and shall be determined by the retirement board on the basis of the interest and mortality tables used for actuarial valuations of the retirement board. 
(f)  Early retirement option after June 30, 1973: Any (i) active member or (ii) conditional member having ten (10) or more years of credited service or (iii) member whose disability benefits are terminated by reason of his recovery, may elect early retirement on any date which is ten (10) or less years prior to the date on which he would first become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a), (b) or (c) of section 157.41, in the case of an active member; or would have become eligible for normal retirement as prescribed in subsection (a) or (b) of Section 157.41 in all other situations covered by this section had he remained in the city's employ. In such event his annuity, as determined by subsection (a) of this section or section 157.40, as the case may be, shall be reduced in amount by two percent (2%) for each full year by which his early retirement date precedes the earliest eligibility date for normal retirement as prescribed in subsections (a) or (b) or (c) of section 157.41, in the case of an active member, or subsection (a) or (b) of section 157.41 in all other situations covered by this section, with a further proportionate reduction for any fraction of a year. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.44. - Additional conditions for all disability annuities payable to any member approved after January 1, 1970. 
Any disability annuity payable to any member whose participation in the retirement fund commences after January 1, 1970 shall be subject to adjustment on account of such member's earnings from employment or self-employment of any kind, and his pension shall be discontinued unless he files with the retirement board annually before April 30th a sworn statement of such earnings for the preceding calendar year as shown in his federal income tax return. The reduction in his disability annuity shall equal fifty percent (50%) of any excess of his earnings in the preceding calendar year over six thousand eight hundred dollars ($6,800.00), but in no event shall such reduction exceed the amount of disability annuity paid for the period during which such excess earnings were earned. Such deduction shall be spread evenly over twelve (12) months, starting with the payment due on April 30th. No such adjustments for earnings shall be made after the disabled member attains the age of sixty-five. 
For any one of these members whose period of credited membership shall have commenced after his fortieth birthday, the amount payable as a disability annuity (before adjustment for earnings) shall be limited to a percentage of his annual rate of pay at the time of disability; this percentage is to be determined by multiplying two percent (2%) by the number of years of membership which he could have accumulated up to his sixty-fifth birthday if he were able to continue his employment for the City until that date.

Any such widow or widower, on remarriage, shall receive only such benefits as are payable to his children alone. 
In the event that payments are made pursuant to this section to surviving children under eighteen years of age who are represented by more than one legal guardian, such payments shall be apportioned among such guardians in proportion to the number of children represented by each guardian, respectively. 
(b)  "Average annual pay," as used in computing survivorship benefits, shall mean the average annual rate of pay received by the deceased member averaged over those five (5) years of service or employment by the city producing the highest average, or the duration of such service or employment if less than five (5) years, subject to a maximum of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) for such average annual pay. 
(c)  Upon the death of a member who has completed ten (10) years of credited service for the city or who has qualified for a disability annuity or a retirement benefit by reason of age and service, a minimum monthly benefit will be paid to his qualified survivors if greater than the amount determined from the benefit table above. Said minimum monthly benefit shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the monthly annuity to which the member would have been entitled if he had been permanently disabled on the date of his death, or fifty percent (50%) of the amount of his actual monthly annuity in the case of a member who has been receiving retirement or disability benefits from the fund. 
(d)  In order to qualify for benefits under this section, a widow or widower must have been married to the deceased member at the time of his death and, if such member had been retired due to age and service or disability, must have been married to him at the time of retirement. Proof of dates of birth of the children must be submitted before payment of benefits under this section. 
(e)  These benefits in section 157.45 shall no longer apply should such widow or widower remarry. In such cases they shall receive only such benefits as are payable to his children alone. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.46. - Requirements for participation. 
(a)  All executive management or confidential employee members who were enrolled in a city pension plan prior to December 1, 1969 shall continue to participate in the fund so long as they serve as eligible employees or officers of the city in accordance with the terms and conditions then prevailing for membership. 
(b)  The following provisions shall apply to eligible appointed officers and executive management or confidential employees whose service commences after December 1, 1969: 
(1)  Any employee who shall enter or transfer to executive management or confidential employee status prior to attainment of age fifty-five shall be required to participate in the retirement fund. 
(2)  Each other new officer or employee who shall be appointed or hired prior to attainment of age fifty-five (55) may elect to be enrolled as a contributing member of the fund as of the first anniversary of the date of his appointment or employment by filing a written application before that date; such participation may also include the first year participation may also include the first year of his appointment or employment if the employee elects to pay the back contribution with three percent (3%) interest compounded annually on his first anniversary date or within six (6) months of the effective date of this amendment, if later. 
Failing this required application, he will be continued under the federal Social Security program which will apply to all such non-civil service employees during their first year of service unless an application for immediate participation is filed with the retirement board during his first thirty (30) calendar days of service. Such Social Security coverage will be discontinued on the employee's earnings after the first year if he makes the application required for enrollment in the retirement fund. This provision for optional participation shall also apply to each appointed officer whose service commences prior to age fifty-five (55) and to each elected officer regardless of age. 
(c)  Each eligible employee shall, upon entering service after approval of these pension provisions by the board of aldermen, submit to such medical examinations as the retirement board shall by regulation or bylaw require in order to determine whether the eligible employee is then permanently disabled from performing duties of the nature required by his job and for use by the retirement board in evaluating future claims for disability. In the event any such employee refuses to submit to any such medical examination, he shall bear the burden of providing by clear and convincing evidence that he is entitled to a disability benefit. 
(d)  No eligible employee entering service after December 1, 1969, shall be admitted to membership in the retirement fund unless he can complete at least ten (10) years of credited service to qualify for a retirement annuity at his mandatory retirement age. 
(e)  An open period of six (6) months commencing with approval of these provisions is hereby established during which any eligible employee who had not previously enrolled as a member may make written application for membership, provided his total period of credited service will be at least ten (10) years on his mandatory retirement date. 
Such application should specify that his membership is to be effective either from the date of his application without payment of back contributions, or from the date on which his service commenced. On the latter basis he must agree to pay all back contributions which would have been required for his prior service with three percent (3%) compound interest, the amount of which will be determined or estimated by the retirement board whose decision shall be final. 
Such payment must be made in a lump sum or equal monthly installments of at least ten dollars ($10.00) over a period not exceeding thirty-six (36) months. Such admission to membership will entail the discontinuance of any Social Security coverage on the member's subsequent earnings. Further, any retirement or disability annuity to which he becomes entitled in accordance with section 157.43 will be subject to reduction by a Social Security adjustment in case he has elected retroactive membership on his prior service. This adjustment will be applied where the city has paid F.I.C.A. taxes for Social Security coverage on his prior earnings and will equal fifty percent (50%) of a proportion of the Social Security primary benefit available on the date of his retirement. Such proportion shall be determined as the percentage which the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from the city bears to the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from all sources since January 1, 1938. 
(f)  This open period subject to the provisions and requirements of paragraph (e) will also be available to any member who wishes to reinstate prior credited service or to establish credit for any period of non-participating prior service which preceded the effective date of his membership, provided such prior period was of at least twelve month's duration. 
(g)  The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) for establishing retroactive membership credits will expire at the end of the open period which will be six (6) months after aldermanic approval of these pension provisions. 
(h)  An open period of six (6) months is established starting the day this amendment is legally enacted, during which any eligible employee who has not previously enrolled as a member may make written application for membership. Such application should specify that this membership is to be effective either from the date of this application without payment of back contributions, or from the date which his service commenced. On the latter basis he must pay all back contributions which would have been required for his prior services, the amount of which shall be determined or estimated by the retirement board, with three percent (3%) compound interest. The decision of the retirement board shall be final. Such payment must be made in a lump sum or in equal monthly installments of at least ten dollars ($10.00) over a period not exceeding thirty-six (36) months. Such admission to membership shall entail the discontinuance of any Social Security coverage on the member's subsequent earnings. Further, any retirement or disability annuity to which he becomes entitled in accord with section 6 [157.43] shall be subject to reduction by a Social Security adjustment in case he has elected retroactive membership on his prior service. This adjustment shall be applied where the city has paid F.I.C.A. taxes for Social Security coverage on his prior earnings and shall equal fifty percent (50%) of a proportion of the Social Security primary benefit available to him on the date of his retirement. Such proportion shall be determined as the percentage which the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from the city bears to the total F.I.C.A. taxes paid on his earnings from all sources since January 1, 1938. Employees who had previously worked for CETA in city jobs without a break in service of greater than two (2) years and/or special funds without a break in service of greater than two (2) years or for redevelopment (who were previously offered a chance to have such redevelopment time credited as pension time) shall specifically be included in this section and be given one last opportunity to buy back said periods of service. 
(i)  This open period subject to the provisions and requirements of paragraph (h) shall also be available to any member who wishes to establish credit for any period of non-participating prior service which preceded the effective date of his membership, provided such prior period was of at least twelve months duration. 
(j)  The provisions of paragraphs (h) and (i) for establishing retroactive membership credits shall expire six (6) months after the date on which the open period shall have commenced.

Sec. 157.47. - Benefits for periods of military service. 
In determining benefits under sections 157.43 and 157.44, credit shall be given for periods of military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, subject to the following conditions: Any member who, after October 16, 1940, entered any branch of the armed forces of the United States or any service auxiliary thereto, or any civil emergency defense employment pursuant to requisition by the federal or state government, including those employees of the municipal airport who were displaced from their regular employment when the army took over the airport and who undertook duties connected with air force, or any member who shall enter such services while the United States is at war, and who has been or shall be re-employed by the city within six months after the termination of such military service, shall qualify for credit for his period of military service, provided he resumes his participation in the Retirement Fund, with an effective date antedating his entry into such service. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.48. - Preservation of benefits paid under previous acts. 
The provisions of this article [this division] shall not affect the benefits already in course of payment in accordance with the provisions of previous acts. 
(Amd. of 7-6-87)  
Sec. 157.49. - Future cost-of-living adjustments. 
On July 1, 1970, and annually on each July 1 thereafter, the monthly payments on those service annuities, disability annuities and survivors' benefits on which at least eighteen (18) monthly payments have been made will be increased, or decreased, for changes in the cost-of-living as indicated by the federal Consumer Price Index. Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, all Cities, revised (1967100). For this purpose the retirement board will determine an adjustment percentage for July 1, 1970, by relating such index for the full calendar year 1969 to that for the full calendar year 1968, but such adjustment percentage shall be limited to a maximum of one hundred three percent (103%) and to a minimum of ninety-seven percent (97%); further, no adjustment will be made where the increase or decrease for the year is less than one-quarter (¼) of one (1) percent. For each case on which payments commenced prior to January 1, 1969, the monthly payment for June 1970, including any previous cost-of-living adjustments, will be multiplied by such adjustment percentage as determined by the retirement board in order to calculate the adjusted monthly payments for the twelve (12) months following July 1, 1970. A similar procedure will be repeated to adjust payments each year thereafter. However, the monthly benefit originally provided for a retired member or for a survivor shall never be reduced because of the accumulative effect of all cost-of-living adjustments.

Sec. 167. - Retirement provisions not to affect authority of board of education to dismiss for cause.

(Special Laws 1959, Act No. 518, § 6)  
Sec. 168. - Board of examiners created; disability retirements. 
The board of retirement herein provided for shall annually appoint three physicians, or surgeons of the city of New Haven, of at least ten years' active practice, who shall be known as the board of examiners, who shall serve without pay and who shall, upon request of the board of education or the board of retirement, make such examinations as may be called for under the terms of this section and report their findings in writing to the board making such request. On recommendation by a majority vote of the board of retirement, the board of education may, by a majority of its members, place on the disability list for the remainder of his or her life, or any part thereof, any such custodian or engineer qualifying under subsection 1 (b) of section 4, [16] provided no custodian or engineer shall be placed upon the disability list until the board of examiners shall have filed a written report within thirty days of examination, certifying that such custodian or engineer is incapacitated for further service as a custodian or engineer. Any applicant for retirement to the disability list under the provisions of subsection 1 (b) of section 4* shall submit to a medical examination by the board of examiners before his or her application shall be considered. The board of education may, by a majority vote of its members and upon recommendation by a majority vote of the board of retirement, place such custodian or engineer on the disability list when such disability shall have been found to exist. No provision of this act [article] shall be construed as prohibiting the board of retirement from recommending, by a majority vote, to the board of education that the disability of any custodian or engineer retired as provided under subsection 1 (b) of section 4*; shall be declared ended. The board of education may, by a majority vote of its members, on such recommendation of said board of retirement, declare ended the disability of such custodian or engineer retired as provided under the terms of subsection 1 (b) of section 4*; and, upon delivery to such custodian or engineer, of a written offer of re-appointment to a position as custodian or engineer equal in remuneration to the one previously held by such custodian or engineer, the payment of the annuity of such custodian or engineer under the disability clause as provided in subsection 1 (b) of section 4*; shall be discontinued. No provision of this act [article] shall be construed as prohibiting a custodian or engineer who shall have been placed upon the disability list from applying once each year to be re-instated to active duty as custodian or engineer. On recommendation by a majority vote of the board of retirement after an examination of such applicant by the board of examiners, the board of education may, by a majority vote, restore such custodian or engineer to active duty, and the disability annuity shall cease on the day that such custodian or engineer shall resume his work at his former remuneration. The disability provided for in subsection 1 (b) of section 4*; shall not be declared ended until an examination shall have been made by the board of examiners and the board of examiners shall have certified, by a majority vote, that such custodian or engineer has been found to be physically and mentally fitted for further service in the public day schools of the city of New Haven. The provisions of this section shall not apply to ordinary cases of temporary disability.

(1)  A surviving widow; 
(2)  Each surviving dependent child. 
Total benefits shall be raised to the next highest multiple of ten cents. 
The maximum monthly benefit to families shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00). Total monthly family benefits shall be reduced to the greater of (1) one and one-half (1½) times the Survivorship Benefit Base, or (2) 80 percent (80%) of the average monthly wage from which the Survivorship Benefit Base was determined.

Footnotes: 
--- (18) --- 
Editor's note Division 1, §§ 180193 contains the provisions of the 1899 charter, Special Laws 1899, Act No. 467, §§ 6669 and §§ 71, 72, as amended, as well as pension provisions clearly applicable to the system there established. Section 70 of said charter was repealed by Special Laws 1929, Act No. 435, § 4, and is therefore not included. Special Laws, 1921, Act No. 376, which also dealt with police and fire pensions failed to gain approval at a required referendum, and has also been omitted from this compilation. This division is applicable only to firemen and policemen employed before December 31, 1957; for provisions concerning pensions for those employed subsequent to that date, see division 2 of this article §§ 200214. 
Subsequently this division was designated "Police and Fire Plan No. 1" and div. 2 was designated "Police and Fire Plan No. 2." The plans were merged into a single new pension plan and fund known as the "Policemen's & Firemen's Pension Fund" by an ordinance adopted May 29, 1990. 
 
Sec. 180. - Policemen and firemen's relief fundsestablished. 
There shall hereafter be a fund for the policemen and a fund for the firemen of said city, known as the Policemen's Relief Fund and the Firemen's Relief Fund, to which shall belong: 
(1)  All moneys and securities included in the fund now existing in each department. 
(2)  All bequests and donations from public or private sources to either department on account of services rendered, or for the purposes for which the fund is established. 
(3)  Five (5) percentum of all fees collected on account of licenses issued to sell spirituous or intoxicating liquors within the city of New Haven until the Policemen's Relief Fund amounts to the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), and the Firemen's Relief Fund amounts to the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). When the funds of these departments equal the sums above named, no more fees from licenses to sell spirituous or intoxicating liquors within the city of New Haven shall be paid into said funds, but shall be paid into the city treasury to be used for ordinary expenses, except the funds at any time shall fall below the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in the Policemen's Relief Fund, and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.) in the Firemen's Relief Fund, then the fees, to the amount of five percentum, collected on account of licenses to sell spirituous or intoxicating liquors within the city of New Haven, shall be paid into said fund until the amounts above named are reached, and the fee shall then cease to be paid, and revert to the city treasury. 
(4)  All moneys or property presented to any member of either department on account of special services, except such as may, by special vote of the board of commissioners of such department, and with the approval of the mayor, be retained by such member. 
(5)  Assessments on the salaries of members of the police department at the rate of two and one-half (2½) percent for the calendar year 1958, three (3) percent for the calendar year 1959, three and one-half (3½) percent for the calendar year 1960, four (4) percent for the calendar year 1961 and four percent per annum thereafter, payable monthly or quarterly as the trustees of such fund may determine.

Editor's note Section 180 above differs from § 252 of the 1952 Revised Charter in the following respects: (1) Said § 252 does not contain the provisions set out in subsection (3) above; (2) Section 252 contains a subsection (f) concerning estimates by the board of finance which does not appear in § 186 above; (3) The provisions of Special Laws 1957, Act No. 406, amending subsections (5) and (6) have been incorporated into § 186 above.

The boards of commissioners of such departments shall respectively be boards of trustees of said funds, and may invest and reinvest the same as the laws relating to trust funds may permit. The mayor shall be president of each of said boards, the city treasurer shall be its treasurer, and the clerk of the department its clerk. All orders on said funds shall be signed by the clerk and countersigned by the president.

Editor's note Section 182 above is the same as § 254 of the 1952 Revised Charter.  
Sec. 183. - Retirement of police, fire personnel for job-connected disability. 
The board of police commissioners, with the affirmative vote of four commissioners and with the mayor's approval, and the board of fire commissioners, with the affirmative vote of three commissioners and with the mayor's approval, may permanently retire any member of the department who, while in the actual performance of duty and by reason of the performance of such duty, and without fault and misconduct on his part, shall have become permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be entirely unfitted to perform such duties; and either of said boards may cause to be paid from the fund of said department to said member during his lifetime and in monthly installments, unless said vote is annulled by four of said police commissioners or three of said fire commissioners, as the case may be, a sum not greater than one-half nor less than one-fourth of his previous compensation; provided however, that in the cases mentioned in this section, such medical examiners as said board may appoint shall certify in writing that such disability exists, and in their opinion from such cause. 
(Special Laws 1899, Act No. 467, § 69) 
Editor's note The provisions of § 183 above are not included in the 1952 Revised Charter.  
Sec. 184. - Retirement of firemen after twenty-five years of service or reaching age of sixty-eight. 
Said board of fire commissioners shall permanently retire any member or employee of the fire department on his or her written request when such member or employee has performed twenty-five years of service in the department. Said board of fire commissioners shall permanently retire any member or employee of the fire department, except the chief thereof, when such member or employee shall reach the age of sixty-eight years, or is of the age of sixty-eight years or over. Said board of fire commissioners may at any time upon a certificate of the medical examiners of the fire department showing that such member is permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be unfit for duty, retire said member from service and place him on the pension list. All persons retired and placed on the pension list under this section shall be awarded an annual pension during his life-time of a sum not less than one-half of the full salary or compensation of such member so retired, payable in monthly installments, irrespective of whether he was retired prior to the passage of this amendment or subsequent thereto. Each pension granted under this section shall be for the natural life of the pensioner and shall not be revoked, repealed nor diminished, provided no member having the right to retire on pension at the time this act [article] shall take effect shall be deprived of such right by reason of his remaining a member of said department or of any provisions of this act [article].

Editor's note Special Laws 1941, Act No. 465, amended § 117 of the 1928 charter revision by adding the provisions which appear as § 184 above. Said § 117 was originally derived from § 69 of the 1899 charter so the editors have treated said 1941 act as an amendment to § 69.

Either the board of police commissioners or the board of fire commissioners may, from time to time, appoint medical examiners to determine whether or not such member of the department to be retired under the provisions of this act continues totally and permanently disabled and incapacitated for further duties, and such member shall be requested to submit himself to any medical examination requested by the board of commissioners of the department of which he was a member. In the event that either the board of police commissioners or the board of fire commissioners shall, upon competent medical evidence, conclude that the disability for which a member is receiving pension no longer exists, it shall order a discontinuance of the payment of benefits as provided herein, and shall restore such member to active duty in the department with which he was connected at the time of his retirement on account of disability.

No such payments or pension shall be allowed or paid to such widow or children so long or for such period as such widow or children shall receive or be entitled to receive compensation under the provisions of the general statutes relating to workmen's compensation. The term "widow," as used in this section, shall be limited in its meaning to the surviving wife of such member, who shall have been married to him prior to his retirement from such department, if retired, and who was living with him at the time of his death, or, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of his fault.

Sec. 206. - Payments to widows of policemen, firemen killed in line of duty. 
There shall be paid to a widow, as designated in section 7 of this act [section 205 of this compilation], of any member of either the police department or the fire department, including supernumeraries in the police department and substitutes in the fire department, who shall be killed while in the actual performance of duty or shall die from the proximate effects of any injuries received while in the actual discharge of such duty, irrespective of the length of service of such member at the time of his death or failure to contribute to the fund established by this act [division], a weekly compensation equal to the difference between the maximum weekly compensation to which a widow of any deceased member is entitled and received under the provisions of the general statutes relating to workmen's compensation, and the weekly earnings of her deceased husband at the time of his death as aforesaid. Such weekly compensation shall be paid to a widow as aforesaid for so long a period as she shall be entitled to and shall receive a weekly compensation under the provisions of the general statutes relating to workmen's compensation. The benefits provided for under this section shall be deemed to be benefits in addition to any otherwise granted. This section shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the pension provision of this act [division] with respect to policemen and firemen, and the benefits provided in this section shall be paid by appropriation from the general funds of the city of New Haven. After the benefits under workmen's compensation have been exhausted a widow may continue to receive benefits as provided for under section 7 of this act [section 205 of this compilation]. The benefits of this section shall be deemed waived by the widow if the widow or her representative or the representative of the estate of her deceased husband shall bring any action for money damages for the death of her husband against the city of New Haven or against any fellow employee of her late husband whom the city of New Haven must indemnify by law. In the event that any money damages are recovered by suit, settlement or otherwise by a widow, as designated in said section 7 [section 205 of this compilation], or by her representative or by the representative of the estate of her deceased husband, for the death of her deceased husband, the city of New Haven shall be entitled to reimbursement from said money damages for any benefits it shall have paid under this section to said widow.

After July 1, 1975, pension rights for members of the police department shall become vested after twenty (20) years of continuous service, conditioned upon the member leaving his contributions in the pension fund. Such deferred vested pension shall become payable on the date when such member would have first become eligible for retirement if he had remained in service, namely, upon his attainment of age forty-eight (48) or upon his completion of twenty-five (25) years of continuous service, if later. The amount of such vested pension shall be equal to two (2) per cent of his average annual rate of pay for his final ten (10) years of service for each full year of his actual service as a policeman. If a member shall die before retirement from active service and prior to completion of ten years of continuous service, the total amount of his contribution shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by him. If no designated beneficiary shall survive the member, said amount may be paid, in the discretion of the board, to the surviving widow, in equal shares to the member's surviving parents or parent or, if there be no surviving parent, in equal shares to the member's surviving brothers and sisters; if said amount is not so paid, it shall be paid to the member's executor or administrator. If a member shall die after retirement from active service and before he shall receive payments on account of his retirement allowance at least equal to the total amount of his contributions to the date of retirement, the difference between said payments and said contributions shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by him. If no designated beneficiary shall survive the member, said amount shall be paid as hereinbefore provided.

In the event of the discontinuance of employment, after ten or more years of continuous service, any member of the fire department shall retain full vested rights to receive a monthly pension commencing on the date when he would otherwise have completed twenty-five (25) years of continuous service, but not prior to his attainment of age forty-six (46), conditioned upon the member leaving his contributions in the pension fund. The amount of his pension will be determined by the regular formula, provided in section 209, as it may be amended from time to time, based on his years of continuous active service as a contributing member of the fund. The regular provisions for survivorship benefits, as contained in section 209, will apply to the vested pension, namely, fifty (50) per cent continuance to a widow alone, seventy (70) per cent to a widow and one child, and ninety (90) per cent to a widow and two (2) or more children, but such payments will be deferred if death occurs prior to the normal commencement date for the vested pension. No disability benefits are provided for vested members. "Continuous service," for the purposes of determining eligibility for vesting under this provision, shall mean uninterrupted service or employment, but absence from service or employment for any reason followed by reinstatement within one year thereafter shall not be considered as breaking the continuity of the service. The effective date of this vesting provision is July 1, 1976.

Sec. 260. - Fund established; divided into two parts. 
There shall be a fund to be known as the "Teachers' Retirement Fund" for the benefit of the teachers of the public day schools of the city of New Haven. Said fund shall consist of two parts: First, the permanent fund, and second, the operating or general fund. The permanent fund shall consist of all assets of the teachers' retirement fund now in the custody of the sinking fund commission as trustee, or its authorized agent, with all additions made to the permanent fund annually, which additions shall be so made by transfer of such unexpended balances as may be in the general fund as of August thirty-first each year, provided there shall always be retained in said fund as of said day a balance not less than twenty-five thousand dollars: 
(1)  All interest accruals of the permanent fund shall be a part of the general fund. 
(2)  All appropriations, gifts or bequests made to the teachers' retirement fund from public or private sources for the purposes for which said retirement fund is established shall be a part of said general fund. 
(3)  For the years beginning January 1, 1944, and January 1, 1945, the city of New Haven shall make an appropriation of, and shall pay into the general fund, a sum equivalent to two and one-half per cent of the actuarial deficit of the teachers' retirement fund as established in the supplementary actuarial report dated April 17, 1943, plus an amount equal to the difference between a yield of two and one-half per cent on the permanent fund as of August 31, 1942, and its actual earned income if less than two and one-half per cent, plus fifteen hundred dollars for the operating expenses of the general fund. Annually thereafter, for a period of thirty years, the city shall appropriate and shall pay into the general fund such proportional part of the actuarial deficit existing in May of each such year as will, by certification of a qualified actuary, amortize such actuarial deficit of the teachers' retirement fund within the years then remaining of said thirty-year period. For the purpose of estimating the actuarial deficit, a triennial survey of said fund shall be made by a qualified actuary, appointed for the purpose of recalculating the required annual amortization payment. Said annual payment shall be certified to by the actuary in May each year for inclusion in the annual budget of the board of education. The actuary shall be paid from the general fund. 
(4)  For the years beginning January 1, 1944, and January 1, 1945, the city shall make an appropriation of and shall pay into the general fund a sum equivalent to not less than one-half the amount of net salary savings of the members of said fund as estimated and appropriated by the board of finance and the board of aldermen each year in the city budget, which estimates and appropriations shall be based on the actual experience of the immediately preceding five years.

In no case shall a teacher be placed on the disability list until said board of examiners shall have filed a report, in writing, within thirty days from the date of examination, to the effect that said teacher has refused to submit to an examination or, after examination, if found by the board of examiners to be physically or mentally unfitted for further service in the day schools of New Haven.

(4)  Nothing in this act [division] shall be construed as prohibiting the board of retirement from recommending, by a majority vote, to the board of education that the disability of a teacher retired under this section shall be declared ended. Said board of education may, by a majority vote, on such recommendation of said board of retirement, declare ended the disability of a teacher retired under the terms of this section, and upon delivery to said teacher of a written offer of reappointment to a position as a teacher equal in remuneration to the one previously held by said teacher, the payment of the annuity of such teacher under this disability clause shall be discontinued. 
(5)  Nothing in this act [Division] shall be construed as prohibiting a teacher who has been placed on the disability list from applying, once each year, to be reinstated to active duty as a teacher. On recommendation by a majority vote of the board of retirement, after an examination of said applicant by the board of examiners, the board of education may, by a majority vote, restore said teacher to active duty, and the disability annuity shall cease on the day that said teacher resumes his or her work as a teacher. 
(6)  In no case, however, shall the disability provided for in subsections (2) and (3) of this section be declared ended or finished until an examination has been made by said board of examiners or the teacher in question has refused to be so examined, and said board of examiners shall have certified, by a majority vote, either to said teacher's refusal to be examined, or that, after such examination, said teacher is found to be physically and mentally fitted for further service in the public day schools of the New Haven city school district. The provisions of this section shall not, however, apply to ordinary cases of temporary disability.

(2)  Any teacher regularly placed on the disability list shall receive an annuity the amount of which shall be one-thirtieth part of the total annuity provided for in subdivision (1) of this section, for each year of service of said teacher, not exceding thirty years. 
(3)  No annuity shall be paid under the provisions of this act [Division], except as provided in subdivision (3) of section five [section 243(3) of this compilation], unless the retiring teacher shall have first paid into the retirement fund such sum or sums as shall make his or her total payments equal to the amount of the annuity paid for the first year; but should any retiring teacher be unable to pay the full amount of said sum before receiving an annuity, the board of trustees shall, in paying the annuity of such teacher, withhold, from each monthly payment, twenty per centum thereof until the full amount hereinbefore provided for shall have been so contributed to the fund.

Any member of said fund who shall die while in service of the department or while on leave of absence or before receiving the first installment benefit under the terms of this act [Division] shall have refunded to his estate, or to such person as shall have been nominated by written designation, executed and filed prior to death, with the secretary of the board of education, all assessments paid, with interest at two per cent per annum, on or after January 1, 1944.

Sec. 268. - Definition of "teachers," "public day schools," "majority."

Any pledge, mortgage sale, assignment, or transfer of, or of any right, claim, or interest in, said retirement fund or in any annuity granted under the provisions of this act [Division] shall be void and said retirement fund and all said annuities shall be exempt from attachment, levy, and sale, and from all legal process, at law or in equity, to sequester the same by or in behalf of any creditor of any person having an interest in said fund or entitled to any such annuity. 
(Special Laws 1911, Act No. 340, § 11)

The City of New Haven shall maintain two lists, each produced by such independent, expert consultant, showing the block by block condition of (1) all sidewalks, and (2) all streets in New Haven. These lists shall be kept current and shall be posted on the city's website; and

On an annual basis, each of the aldermen shall develop a list of projects for their ward ranked in order of greatest priority based on a scale which factors in public safety urgency, as well as the degree of constituent concern. Such list shall be submitted to the City Resources Allocation Subcommittee on a date determined by the allocation subcommittee in 2012 and annually no later than June 15 of each year thereafter. 
The appropriate type of paving treatment for a ward street to be repaved shall be determined by the city engineer and/or the director of public works. The subcommittee shall consult with and seek the advice and expertise of the city engineer, director of public works and director of parks, recreation and trees in expediting completion of the selected sidewalk, street and tree projects.

The new resource allocation process for sidewalk improvements, street paving, tree trimming or removal, and stump removal shall take effect and commence operation beginning with the Fiscal Year budget 2012-2013 and that; 
A.  The funds for street paving consist of the: 
1.  Emergency Street Paving Fund: Each fiscal year funds shall be allocated for this purpose based on the average of the last five (5) years actual expenditures for urgent unforeseeable projects throughout the city which posed a public safety risk and required immediate remedial action. 
2.  General Street Paving Fund: Each fiscal year funds a minimum of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) shall be allocated for this purpose. The C.R.A. subcommittee may recommend that the board of aldermen increase the amount. 
B.  The funds for sidewalks consist of the: 
1.  Emergency Sidewalk Fund: Each fiscal year funds shall be allocated for this purpose based on the average of the last five (5) years actual expenditures for urgent unforeseeable projects throughout the city which posed a public safety risk and required immediate remedial action 
2.  General Sidewalk Fund: Each fiscal year a minimum of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be allocated shall for this purpose. The C.R.A. subcommittee may recommend that the board of aldermen increase this amount.

The C.R.A. subcommittee may recommend that the board of aldermen increase this amount. 
Working within budgetary limits, the City Resources Allocation Subcommittee will select and approve all street and sidewalk work prior to any work commencing (with the exception of emergency repairs, which must be reported to the C.R.A. subcommittee for review no more than thirty (30) days from when such job commenced). The C.R.A. subcommittee shall prioritize and select all non-emergency projects to be scheduled, based on ratings by the consultant; recommendations and input on each ward's priorities based on lists supplied by individual aldermen; and based on advice and consultation with the city engineer, director of public works and other appropriate city officials. Emphasis is to be given to repairing those streets and sidewalks deemed to be in the worst condition or a greater safety risk. 
The C.R.A. subcommittee will communicate regularly with the board of aldermen on the selection and scheduling of the projects to be done on streets, sidewalks, and trees, as well as provide regular quarterly reports on all street, sidewalk and tree work to the entire board, upon submission such communication including but not limited to all quarterly reports shall also be posted on the city's website by the city staff on the C.R.A subcommittee; and 
The C.R.A. will report to the Finance Committee of the Board of Aldermen in November, 2012 and as needed to review this ordinance and make recommendations for amendment to the ordinance for future fiscal years.

(5)  The City of New Haven's policy on city-based businesses shall be stated in the request for proposal. 
(d)  Authority of the purchasing agent to determine status as an independent contractor and/or exempt professional, subject to review: 
(1)  The purchasing agent shall determine in the first instance whether a "request for proposal" is properly seeking work to be done by an independent contractor as defined herein;

(2)  Ensure that meritorious mayoral candidates are able to raise and spend sufficient campaign funds through public financing of elections to convey their messages to the voters; 
(3)  Reduce the need for ongoing fundraising and to encourage mayoral candidates to spend more time communicating with citizens; 
(4)  Give all citizens an opportunity for a reasonable supporting role in the selection of mayor by making even small contributions meaningful.

(2)  Candidate means an individual who seeks election or nomination for election to the office of mayor, whether or not such individual is elected. For purposes of this ordinance, an individual shall be deemed to seek election or nomination for election if such individual has (1) been endorsed by a party or become eligible for a position on the ballot at an election or primary, or (2) solicited or received contributions, made expenditures, or given his or her consent to any other person to solicit or receive contributions or make expenditures with the intent to bring about his or her election or nomination for election to the office of mayor.

For fiscal year 2008-2009 and subsequent fiscal years, the board shall issue in January a report to the mayor and the board of aldermen of its expenditures and the current balance of its account, and shall include a specific recommendation for funding for the following fiscal year. In 2007 and in subsequent years, the board of aldermen will consider the recommendation of the democracy fund board and the on-going funding needs of the fund in its budget deliberations and again in its post-budget approval amendment process. The board of aldermen will exercise its best efforts to make sufficient appropriations to the fund to allow it to carry out its operations effectively. The board of aldermen will also consider in a prompt manner any interim requests made by the board for supplemental appropriations needed during the fiscal year. The fund can also accept any voluntary individual contributions made to it. 
Once city general funds or individual contributions are appropriated and deposited into the fund, they cannot be transferred for other purposes, canceled, or rescinded. The city's finance department shall be responsible for the prudent investment of the fund's assets, balancing the need for investment growth with the need for liquidity at certain time periods. Investment earnings credited to the assets of the fund shall become part of the assets of the fund. All monies deposited in the fund shall be used only for the purposes of this article, including for the administration of the fund. Any unused funds shall carry over from year-to-year in the fund.

The mayor will indicate the length of the initial term of the first seven (7) members when nominating them. After each original term has expired, all appointments will be for terms of four (4) years. In the event that a member is no longer able to serve due to illness, death, or resignation, the mayor may nominate a replacement to serve out the remainder of the term. Replacement nominees must also be confirmed by the New Haven Board of Aldermen. If a member's term has expired and his or her successor has not been appointed and confirmed, the member shall continue to serve until his or her successor has been appointed and confirmed. A member may be removed only for just cause, which may include excessive absenteeism from board meetings or failure to carry out the duties of a board member, as determined by the mayor and approved by the board of aldermen. 
(c)  Said board's duties shall include the:

The investigator's responsibilities shall include the confidential investigation of, and the preparation of reports concerning, alleged violations and complaints made against participating candidates at the direction of the administrator or the board. 
(g)  The administrator shall draft any and all forms necessary to carry out the provisions of this article, including the forms for the standardized candidate contract and for candidate requests for public matching funds. Said forms must be approved by the board. The administrator shall also draft a schedule for the issuing of matching contributions to participating candidates. Said schedule must be approved by the board. 
(h)  The administrator shall review candidate contracts and declarations, participation and non-participation affidavits, nomination papers, requests for public matching funds, and campaign financial disclosure reports in a timely fashion to certify a candidate's eligibility to receive public matching funds. After review, and in accordance with the approved schedule for matching the contributions of participating candidates, and if the administrator determines that the candidate is eligible, the administrator shall issue a request to the treasurer of the city for checks or electric fund transfers to be issued to the candidate's qualified committee. 
(i)  The administrator shall have five (5) calendar days to process requests for public matching funds and disburse the public funds to the qualified committee.

(a)  No participating candidate, nor the mayoral committee of such candidate, shall accept contributions in excess of three hundred dollars ($300.00), in the aggregate for a particular election, from any individual or party town committee. Subject to the contribution limits of this ordinance and those imposed by Chapter 155 of the Connecticut General Statutes, a participating candidate and his or her mayoral committee may only accept contributions from individuals and from a New Haven party town committee, and may not accept contributions from "political committees" or "business entities" as those terms are defined in Connecticut General Statutes, Section 9-601(a). The contribution limits of this ordinance take precedence over state-imposed limits. Only contributions from registered voters of the City of New Haven shall be considered matchable contributions under this ordinance. 
(b)  No participating candidate, nor the mayoral committee of such candidate, shall make qualified campaign expenditures in excess of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) in a primary election, or in excess of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) in a general election, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(c)  If a nonparticipating candidate, or the mayoral committee of such candidate, makes expenditures of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for either a primary or a general election, participating candidates who have reached eighty-five (85) percent of the expenditure ceiling can either choose to (1) apply for and spend an additional twenty-five thousand-dollar ($25,000) public financing grant from the fund or (2) have the expenditure ceiling lifted. A participating candidate who has not reached eighty-five percent (85) of the expenditure ceiling of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) shall not be eligible to receive this twenty-five thousand-dollar ($25,000.00) grant. 
(d)  Any participating candidate who chooses to have the voluntary expenditure ceiling lifted will not have further contributions matched. 
(e)  Any participating candidate whose mayoral committee receives, before or after he or she agrees to participate, a contribution in excess of the amount allowed under this article, or a kind of contribution not allowed under this article, must return promptly (or, if received prior to participation, promptly after agreeing to participate) the excess portion of the contribution or the entire contribution, as the case may be, and if returning such contribution or portion thereof is not possible or feasible, it shall be paid to the fund. 
(f)  For purposes of the voluntary expenditure ceilings, qualified campaign expenditures to a candidate who wins a primary made at any time up to and including the date of the primary election shall be considered expenditures for that primary election, and qualified campaign expenditures made after the date of the primary election shall be considered expenditures for the general election. However, in the event that payments are made but the goods or services are not used during the primary period, the payments shall be considered qualified campaign expenditures for the general election period. Payments for goods or services used during both periods shall be prorated. 
(g)  Any monies raised by a participating primary candidate, who will also be a general election candidate, in the primary election period (which ends on 11:59 p.m. of either the day of the primary or the day it is determined that there will not be a primary), including matching funds and a public financing grant, that are unexpended, as defined in (f) above, will become part of the general election candidate committee's funds and, to the extent expended, will be counted toward the general election expenditure ceiling.

(2)  Once the administrator determines that a participating candidate has met the contributions threshold, the candidate shall receive a match of fifty dollars ($50.00) per distinct individual contributor who is a registered voter of the City of New Haven of twenty-five or more dollars ($25.00) until the candidate raises enough funds to meet the voluntary expenditure ceiling. The participating candidate shall receive a two (2) to one (1) match for any such contributions under twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
(3)  All contributions received by a participating candidate must include the name and address of the contributor on the check or on a separate card or sheet with the name and address of the contributor and signed by the contributor and stating the amount of the contribution.

(b)  All surplus public matching funds, or matching funds used in violation of the requirements of this article, shall be returned or reimbursed to the fund. 
(c)  If the candidate withdraws from a primary or general election, becomes ineligible or dies during the campaign, or if a candidate is eligible for a primary election, but the primary election is canceled, the candidate's qualified committee will return to the fund, for deposit in the fund, all monies received from the fund which it has not spent, or has not become legally obligated to expend, on qualified campaign expenditures as of the date of such occurrence. 
(d)  When determining whether these are surplus matching funds that must be returned to the fund, the board will consider the first funds spent to be public funds.

Sec. 9-51. - Anti-blight and property maintenance ordinance. 
Declaration of Policy. 
This section is to be known as the Anti-Blight and Property Maintenance Ordinance and is enacted and authorized pursuant to Conn. General Statutes, Section 7-148(c)(7)(H)(xv), as amended from time to time. 
It is hereby found and declared that a large number of real properties containing blighted lots and blighted buildings exist within the City of New Haven, and that the continued existence of such blighted lots and buildings contributes to the decline of neighborhoods. 
It is further found that these blighted lots and buildings adversely affect the city's economic well-being, and are inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents. 
It is further found that there are many instances where property maintenance of real properties in the City of New Haven is deficient or lacking leading to progressive deterioration of such properties and the creation of blighted conditions. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the citizens of the City of New Haven that the city set minimum standards for property maintenance so as to assure that properties within the city be maintained in conformity with such standards and so as to assure that none of these structures and properties will deteriorate and adversely affect their surrounding neighborhoods. 
It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same. By reason of timely regulations and restrictions, as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and neighborhood and property values may thereby be maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods enhanced, and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

Property maintenance violations shall also include situations in which the overall condition of the premises causes an unreasonable impact on the enjoyment of or value of neighboring properties as expressed by persistent complaints from adjoining and nearby property owners. 
Property maintenance violations shall not include the violation of any of the above standards when they exist on exempt property. 
(e)  Penalty for violation. Violation of this section shall result in a fine up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) or the maximum amount authorized by state statutes or this Code for each day that said violation continues. 
(f)  Enforcement. The director and/or other official designated by the mayor shall be charged with supervising the enforcement of this ordinance. The mayor shall also designate an enforcement officer or officers to carry out the enforcement of this section. It shall be the duty of the enforcement officer(s) to enforce the provisions of this section and any rules or regulations promulgated under this section. The enforcement officer shall undertake inspections of complaints for the purpose of documenting violations of this section. The enforcement officer may order any owner who violates this ordinance to abate such violation, and shall be hereby authorized and empowered to issue citations for violations of this section. The enforcement officer shall also be authorized and empowered to effectuate the removal or abatement of the anti-blight violation and/or property maintenance violation under the procedures set forth in this section. 
(g)  Inspections and investigations: reports. The enforcement officer shall initiate inspections and investigations and shall receive information and complaints, concerning violations of the provisions of this section. The enforcement officer shall provide the director with monthly written status reports indicating the number of complaints, violations identified, active and closed cases and other information as requested. 
(h)  Special consideration. Special consideration shall be given to any individual who is an elderly individual or a disabled individual, if such individual is elderly or disabled and no capable individual resides in the residence. In such cases, the enforcement officer may give such elderly individual or disabled individual additional time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to correct the violation, and at the expiration of any additional time granted by the enforcement officer, the director may grant such elderly individual or disabled individual additional time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to correct the violation. 
Where the owner of a premises where an anti-blight violation and/or property maintenance violation is found to be a low income individual under this section, the enforcement officer may give special consideration to such individual by providing additional time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to correct the violation, and at the expiration of any additional time granted by the enforcement officer, the director may grant such low income individual additional time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to correct the violation. 
However, in the case of an owner who is an elderly individual, a disabled individual or a low-income individual, if the violations have to do with lawn, brush, weeds and shrub maintenance or keeping the grounds free from rubbish and debris, or if the violations constitute a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, neither the enforcement officer nor the director shall grant additional time to correct the violation. 
(i)  Notice of violation. The city shall serve a written notice to an owner of a premises of the violation(s) of this section by personal in-hand service or delivery, or by mailing such notice to the owner's last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall direct the removal, correction or abatement of the violation within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the written notice and shall notify the owner that failure to remove, correct or abate the violation shall result in the issuance of a citation in accordance with this ordinance. Such notice shall further inform the owner that failure to remove, correct or abate the violation will result in fines being imposed which can be enforceable subsequently as a lien on the owner's property, and may be also converted into court judgments, or the city may cause the removal or abatement of the violation at the expense of the owner. 
(j)  Citation/Penalties. If the owner fails to remove, correct or abate the violation within ten (10) calendar days after receiving a notice of violation, as provided in subsection (i) above, the city shall serve a written civil citation on the owner of the premises. However, if the owner, within that ten (10) day period, demonstrates to the enforcement officer that he/she intends in good faith to rehabilitate or demolish the premises, or that the violation has occurred as a result of a casualty loss for which insuance is available, but the owner needs additional time to remove, correct or abate the violation, then the enforcement officer, in his/her discretion, may issue a written stay of the enforcement of the citation and the enforcement of any fines imposed against the owner. Said stay shall be expressly conditioned upon the rehabilitation or demolition of the premises within a specified period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days, unless the owner requests in writing to the director within the time specified by the enforcement officer that the stay should be extended for an additional period of time, in which case, the director may extend such stay in writing for an additional time not to exceed sixty (60) days. If the conditions of the stay have not been met within the specified time period, or the time period as it may be extended, as provided above, the stay will be terminated and all fines assessed against the owner shall be enforced against the owner in accordance with this section. 
The citation shall be served upon the owner by personal in-hand service or delivery, or by mailing such citation to the owner's last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested. The civil citation shall provide the owner with the following information: 
(1)  The allegations made against him/her and the amount of the proposed fines per day of continued violation of the ordinance; 
(2)  That he/she may contest his/her liability before the city's duly appointed hearing officer by delivering written notice in person or by mail to said Hearing Officer c/o the Director, Livable City Initiative, City Hall, 165 Church Street, 3rd floor, New Haven, CT 06511 within ten (10) calendar days from the date of receipt of the citation(s); 
(3)  That if he/she does not demand such a hearing within such ten (10) calendar days in accordance with this ordinance, he/she shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the hearing officer may assess a fine without further notice; 
(4)  That the city may file a lien against said real property in accordance with Conn. General Statutes, Section 7-148aa as amended from time to time, for the amount of any unpaid fine for an anti-blight violation and/or property maintenance violation imposed by the city in accordance with this section; 
(5)  That said lien may be enforced in the same manner as a property tax lien. Pursuant to Conn. General Statutes Section 7-148aa, as amended from time to time, any unpaid fine imposed pursuant to this citation hearing procedure shall constitute a lien upon the Real Property against which the fine was imposed from the date of the fine. The lien shall be continued, recorded, released and enforced as provided for by said statute. Such liens shall take precedence over all other liens and other encumbrances, except taxes, filed after July 1, 1997; 
(6)  That fines imposed may be converted to a court judgment for money damages with additional court cost imposed; and 
(7)  That in the case of violations which pose a danger to the public health, welfare and safety, the city may cause the conditions to be corrected, removed or abated at the expense of the owner, and that the amount of such costs for correction, removal or abatement may also become a lien against the owner's real property. 
(k)  Hearing officer. The mayor shall appoint one or more hearing officer(s), who shall not be a city employee, to conduct the hearings authorized by this section. Such hearing officer shall serve without pay. The mayor may remove any such hearing officer at any time for whatever reason he/she deems sufficient. 
(l)  Appeal; hearing procedure for citations. If an owner who is sent notice pursuant to Section (i) above wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he/she may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fine(s) admitted to, in person or by mail to the city by delivering it to the director. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any owner who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the notice of violation provided for in subsection (i) above, shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated hearing officer shall certify such Owner's failure to respond to the enforcement officer. said enforcement officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fine(s) so provided for, and shall follow the procedures set forth in this ordinance for placing a lien on the real property, or obtaining a court judgment. 
Any owner who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the notice, unless the owner requesting the hearing agrees to an earlier date. The hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. The city shall present at the hearing the original notice of violation, a certified copy of such notice, the violator's copy or a certified copy of the violator's copy issued by an enforcement officer, and such original or certified copy shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of Connecticut General Statutes, Section 52-180 and evidence of the facts contained therein. The Enforcement Officer may, but is not required, to appear at the hearing, but shall be required to appear if the owner specifically requests the enforcement officer's presence. An owner who wishes to contest his/her liability shall appear at the hearing, and may present evidence on his/her behalf, or the owner may request that the hearing be conducted by mail, and may submit documents and copies of reports for the hearing officer's review. The hearing officer may grant a request for a hearing by mail, or may determine at any time (including after a hearing by mail has been granted and undertaken) that a hearing in person is necessary to fairly adjudicate the matter, and that the owner must appear in person at a hearing. If the enforcement officer is not able to attend the hearing, and his/her presence has not been specifically requested by the owner, a designated city official, other than the hearing officer and other than the enforcement officer, may present evidence on behalf of the city. 
If the owner fails to appear, or fails to request a hearing by mail within the timeframe set forth herein, the hearing officer may enter a default upon finding of proper notice and liability under applicable law. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form, and with such methods of proof as he/she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his/her decision at the end of the hearing. If the owner demonstrates that he/she intends to rehabilitate or demolish the premises, by the submission of documentation such as construction plans, permits and the availability of sufficient funds to pay for such work satisfactory to the hearing officer, then the hearing officer shall stay the matter and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. Said stay shall be expressly conditioned upon the rehabilitation or demolition of the premises within a specified period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, unless the director requests in writing to the hearing officer within the time specified by the hearing officer that the stay should be extended for an additional period of time, in which case, the hearing officer shall extend such stay for the additional time requested by the director. If the conditions of the stay have not been met within the specified time period, or the time period as it may be extended, as provided above, the hearing officer shall enter and assess the fines against the owner as provided in this ordinance retroactive to the date of the hearing. If he/she determines that the person is not liable, the hearing officer shall dismiss the matter, and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. If he/she determines that the person is liable for the violation(s), the hearing officer shall forthwith enter and assess the fines against such owner, and levy such fines as provided for herein. The hearing officer shall forward a notice of assessment to the enforcement officer for further action. 
If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the enforcement officer shall send by first class mail a Notice of Assessment to the Owner found liable and shall file, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than twelve (12) months after such mailing, a certified copy of the Notice of Assessment with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Housing Session, 121 Elm Street, New Haven, CT 06510, together with the appropriate entry fee. The certified copy of the Notice of Assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve (12) month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment with appropriate court costs against such owner in favor of the city. Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Statutes, the notice of Assessment, when entered as a court judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such owner. 
An owner against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this ordinance is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal must be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen the assessment, together with an entry fee with the Clerk of the Superior Court, Housing Session 121 Elm Street, New Haven, CT 06510, which shall entitle such person to a court hearing. 
(m)  Waiver of fines. The director shall waive and release fines and liens if the city acquires the premises. If the premises is purchased by a private third-party buyer, the director may also waive and release part or all of the fines and liens at the time of the sale of the premises, if in the director's opinion, the buyer has the financial ability and intention to immediately rehabilitate the premises, or the director may defer the enforcement of the fines until all rehabilitation work is completed to the satisfaction of the director. 
(n)  Fines collected. All funds collected by the city as fines through the civil citation process shall be deposited into an account to be administered by the director to be used for associated costs in enforcing and administering this ordinance (e.g., court fees, service of notices and citations, copying, postage, etc.). The account shall be a continuing or revolving account.

Such notice shall be served by in-hand service or delivery, or shall be mailed by registered mail to the owner at his/her last known address. 
(2)  Actions upon noncompliance. Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner so notified to correct, remove or abate suc violations which are dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the written notice provided for in subsection (1) above, or within ten (10) days after the date of such notice in the event the same is returned to the city because of the inability to make delivery thereof, provided the same was properly addressed to the last known address of the owner, the city may cause such abatement by city staff or an independent contractor engaged by the city of such violation(s) at the expense of the owner of the premises where such violation(s) exist. 
(3)  Conference granted to owner. Any owner notified under subsection (1) above shall be granted a conference with the director or his/her designee upon the written request of the owner within such ten (10) calendar day period. Such conference shall be granted as soon as practicable, but the conference shall in no way stay the required abatement of such violations and any accumulation of fines imposed. 
(4)  Recorded statement constitutes lien. Upon completion of the abatement of such violation(s) by city staff or by an independent contractor engaged by the city to abate the violation(s), the director or his/her designee shall determine the actual cost of the abatement and shall bill the owner therefor. Upon the failure of the owner to pay the city the amount of such charge within thirty (30) days from the date of such bill, the director or his/her designee shall cause to be recorded in the land records of the city a sworn statement detailing the cost and expense incurred for the abatement work, the date the work was done and the location of the property upon which the work was done. The recordation of the sworn statement shall constitute a lien on the property. 
(p)  Rules and regulations. The director may promulgate rules and regulations providing for the reasonable interpretation of the terms of this section, and for the day-to-day conduct of the investigation and enforcement under this section, so long as such rules and regulations do not exceed the scope of this section. 
(q)  Consistency with other enforcement methods. This section is intended to be enforced and applied in a manner consistent with other available administrative remedies for the enforcement of anti-blight violations and/or property maintenance violations, but is not intended to be exclusive of such other remedies, penalties or enforcement actions which may be available to the city.

Sec. 12¼-5. - Utilization goals for city construction contracts. 
(a)  Purpose. In accordance with the findings of the utilization study, the evidence supports the conclusion that MBE and WBE firms have been disadvantaged by discriminatory practices when competing for participation as contractors or subcontractors on city construction contracts. In order to eliminate the disparity between the availability and utilization of MBEs, and WBEs the city is establishing goals to achieve an adequate level of MBE participation in city construction contracts. The MBE and WBE utilization goals represent a reasonable expectation of MBE and WBE utilization based on current utilization levels and the availability of MBE and WBE firms as determined by the utilization study. The goals are not quotas, but rather a public statement of the city's aspiration for diversity among its contractors and an approximate benchmark to measure the city's progress in overcoming the disparity. 
(b)  Ethnicity-specific utilization goals. The utilization study identified differences in the level of utilization of contractors and subcontractors from various minority groups as defined in this chapter. The city seeks to achieve MBE and WBE participation in city construction contracts proportionate to the availability of qualified MBE and WBE firms within the construction industry. 
The city hereby establishes the following ethnic specific goals for city construction contracts for the twelve-month period following the effective date of this chapter. 
(1)  For African American firms, ten (10) percent of the total value of city construction contracts and ten (10) percent of the total value of subcontracts on city construction contracts. 
(2)  For Hispanic American firms, two and one-half (2.5) of the total value of city construction contracts and six (6) percent of the total value of subcontracts on city construction contracts. 
(c)  Gender-specific utilization goals. The utilization study identified differences between the level of utilization of women-owned firms and other firms. The city seeks to achieve participation by women-owned firms in city funded contracts proportionate to the availability of such firms within the construction industry. The city hereby establishes gender specific goals for women-owned firms for the twelve-month period following the effective date of this chapter at eleven (11) percent of the total value of city construction contracts and fifteen (15) percent of the total value of subcontracts on city construction contracts. 
(d)  Revision of goals. The goals will be revised on an annual basis in accordance with current utilization and availability data. The goals from any previous year will remain in effect until the economic development administrator approves the new goals. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-6. - Small business enterprise contractor capability-building. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to nurture small and underutilized contractors who have the potential for long-term, sustainable success on a level playing field, by helping them to improve business operations. 
(b)  Outreach. The economic development small construction development program will provide outreach to underutilized firms regarding registration as SBEs and MBEs pursuant to this chapter, bid opportunities, training and other services. Outreach will include a variety of print and electronic media, as well as leveraging local organizations where appropriate. Notification of bid opportunities will be accomplished through a combination of the following: 
(1)  Facsimile broadcast to contractors; 
(2)  E-mail notification to registered contractors within the relevant industry segment; 
(3)  Posting of the information on a publicly accessible website; 
(4)  Posting of the information at a central physical location with after-hours access; 
(5)  Announcement in three (3) relevant targeted publications aimed at underutilized contractors. At the city's discretion, announcement may be consolidated with ongoing permanent advertisements that specifically list upcoming bid opportunities, relevant training opportunities, and the address for the publicly accessible website. 
(c)  Training and support services. 
(1)  In order to facilitate first-time contracts or larger contracts between the city and SBEs, the city may offer seminars to introduce contractors to city personnel and procedures. These seminars would provide an opportunity for SBE contractors to become registered, to learn the requirements for submitting bids, to meet relevant city department heads, to learn how to access city resources, and to learn how to accommodate wage rates and other labor requirements. 
(2)  The city will sponsor construction management training and mentoring programs to assist SBEs in developing and strengthening their management capabilities. The city may also sponsor and/or co-sponsor educational programs for contractors on financial management, business development, technology, and other programs as necessary. 
(3)  The city will coordinate training and support services with other public and private entities that provide services to contractors. 
(4)  The city will encourage and facilitate voluntary mentor-protégé relationships between high-potential, under-utilized firms with larger contractors.

Sec. 12¼-7. - Set aside opportunities for small business enterprises. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to enable SBEs to compete for city construction contracts on smaller projects without being unduly disadvantaged by their size or other diseconomies of smaller scale. 
(b)  Procedure. The city construction managers and prime contractors shall set aside, for award to contractors registered in the small contractor program on the basis of competitive selection procedures, city construction contracts valued at one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) or less. 
(1)  The provisions of this section shall apply to the following types of city contracts: 
a.  City construction contracts valued at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less for which informal bidding is required. 
b.  City construction contracts valued at more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) dollars and up to a maximum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) for which competitive bidding is required; 
(2)  If the apparent, responsive low bidder for set-aside contracts submits a bid that exceeds one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) the purchasing agent may in his sole discretion accept the bid if it is within ten (10) percent of the set-aside ceiling of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00). 
(3)  If bids for non-set-aside contracts fall below the set-aside limit of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) the purchasing agent in his or her sole discretion may accept the bids or rebid the contract as a set-aside contract. However, the bureau of purchasing shall maintain a record of all such bids and analyze such bids to ensure that the intent of this chapter has not been violated or otherwise defeated. 
(4)  Contracts may be exempted from the set-aside provisions of this chapter if any of the following conditions apply: 
a.  There are fewer than two (2) registered SBE firms for the particular trade or project type; 
b.  Fewer than two (2) registered SBE firms submitted a bid; 
c.  No responsive bids are submitted as determined by the purchasing agent;

Sec. 12¼-7.1. - Set-aside opportunitiesSchool construction contracts. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to enable SBE firms to participate in the school construction program, a major initiative to renovate existing schools and build new schools in the city. The school construction program is a joint program between the city and the New Haven Public Schools that is funded in part by proceeds from the school construction trust fund and with eligible matching grant funds from the State of Connecticut. School construction projects represent a significant portion of the city's construction projects and a major source of construction opportunities for underutilized firms. 
(b)  Procedure. The city, construction managers and prime contractors shall set aside, for award to registered SCD firms, on the basis of competitive selection procedures, school construction contracts valued at ten (10) percent of the total amount expended for school construction contracts. This provision shall include all school construction contracts awarded pursuant to construction management agreements. No single contract awarded to a prime contractor or a first tier subcontractor shall receive more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) credit towards the requirements of this subsection. All subcontractor work awarded to an SCD contractor under the first tier shall receive full credit toward meeting the requirements of this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1347, § 6, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-8. - Minority business enterprise requirements for informal bids up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to increase the utilization of underutilized MBEs and WBEs by facilitating the competitive selection of MBE and WBE contractors for city construction contracts valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
(b)  Procedure. This provision is applicable to city construction contracts under fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for which informal bidding is required. 
(1)  Pursuant to New Haven Ordinance 2-151 (as amended), city construction contracts under fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be awarded in accordance with the informal quotation and informal bidding procedures established by the purchasing agent. 
(2)  For procurement of construction and construction related services under fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the purchasing agent or his/her designee must receive at least three informal bids or quotes from registered SBEs, and at least two (2) of the three (3) bids must be from registered MBEs or WBEs. 
(3)  If the purchasing agent or his/her designee is unable to obtain at least three (3) bids from registered SBEs, or at least two (2) bids from registered MBEs, or WBEs the city construction contract will be re-bid unless small construction business development program agrees that a waiver should be granted. A waiver may be granted if it can be shown that a good faith effort was made to reach a sufficient number of potential set aside bidders or that there are extraordinary circumstances relating to the project such that a waiver is warranted. 
(4)  If under these provisions, the apparent responsive, low informal bidder submits an informal bid that exceeds the limit of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) the bids may be accepted in the sole discretion of the purchasing agent if it is within ten (10) percent of the informal bid limit. 
(c)  Annual limit. To deter program manipulation or dependence upon these provisions, once a contractor has been awarded a contract or contracts in an aggregate amount of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000.00) through the City of New Haven in any one (1) fiscal year, such contractor will not be eligible to participate in additional informal bids in that fiscal year. 
(d)  Audit. The informal bid program shall be audited on an annual basis to ensure compliance with bureau of purchases procedures established for such purchases. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-9. - MBE subcontractor utilization and good faith effort requirements. 
(a)  The city's specific goals for utilization of MBE and WBE subcontractors are defined in section 12¼-5 of this chapter. The city hereby requires that all parties bidding or otherwise seeking to be qualified as a contractor with respect to a city construction contract (a "potential contractor") shall aggressively make every effort to obtain MBE, WBE subcontracting participation in order to achieve the utilization goals. In the case where a potential prime contractor is a MBE contractor, the potential contractor shall make every effort to obtain WBE subcontracting participation to achieve the utilization goals. In the case where a potential prime contractor is a WBE contractor, the potential contractor shall make every effort to obtain MBE subcontracting participation to achieve the utilization goals. 
(b)  The provisions of this section 12¼-9 shall apply to all city construction contracts that are over one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) and that are not bid through the set-aside program. 
(c)  The city intends to award city construction contracts to the lowest responsible bidder that has achieved or made a good faith effort to achieve the MBE, WBE utilization goals. Failure by any potential contractor to demonstrate that they have either achieved the utilization goals, or that they have made good faith efforts to achieve the utilization goals as required hereunder, will result in a determination by the purchasing agent that the potential contractor is not a responsible bidder with respect to the city construction contract in question. 
(d)  In order to achieve the MBE, WBE utilization goals, a contractor may award contracts to subcontractors that are certified as MBEs or WBEs the purpose of this program, or may enter into a joint venture (or other commercially reasonable relationship which is satisfactory to the city for the purposes of this program) with one (1) or more MBEs, WBEs for the purpose of carrying out the city construction contract. The MBEs, WBEs must self-perform actual construction work (or construction-related work such as site preparation, etc.) and not merely act as a passive conduit. 
(e)  A potential contractor shall submit signed contracts or letters of commitment with the MBEs, WBEs that will be utilized by the potential contractor in the carrying out of such city construction contract, together with a list of the respective dollar amounts payable to each such MBE, WBE. For credit to be given, each MBE, WBE must be registered as an MBE, WBE prior to submittal of such list by the potential contractor. 
(f)  A potential contractor will be considered in compliance with the goals if they have achieved at least twenty-five (25) percent overall MBE, WBE utilization for the entire project. 
(g)  If the potential contractor can demonstrate that it has successfully achieved the twenty-five (25) percent overall MBE, WBE utilization goals for the entire project the bureau of purchases is not required to evaluate other efforts the prime bidder made to achieve the goal. If, however, the potential contractor has failed to meet the goals and desires to be considered for the bid, the potential contractor's good faith effort will be evaluated, verified and will generally be recognized if a contractor has accomplished at least four (4) of the following: 
(1)  The submittal of scope specific subcontracting opportunities with the SCD office for distribution; 
(2)  Demonstrate to the SCD office whether the contractor provided relevant plans, specifications or terms and conditions to certified minority- and women-owned business enterprises sufficiently in advance to enable them to prepare an informed response to a contractor request for participation as a subcontractor; 
(3)  Verification of quotes received from subcontractors that were denied because of cost, quality, availability, etc.; 
(4)  Verification of outreach and collaboration with the New Haven Regional Contractors Alliance; 
(5)  The contractor identified economically feasible units of the project that could be contracted or subcontracted to certified minority- and women-owned business enterprises in order to increase the likelihood of participation by such enterprises on the contract; 
(6)  Conducting a networking event with owner, construction manager, and prime contractors; 
(7)  Holding individual trade meetings with construction manager, prime contractors and sub-contractors; 
(8)  Other efforts as determined in advance by the Small Contractor Development Office; 
(9)  The contractor followed-up initial solicitations by contacting the enterprises to determine whether the enterprises were interested in such contracting or subcontracting opportunity; 
(10)  The contractor negotiated in good faith with certified minority- and women-owned business enterprises submitting bids, proposals, or quotations and did not, without justifiable reason, reject as unsatisfactory any bids, proposals or quotations prepared by any certified minority- or women-owned business enterprise. "Good faith" negotiating means engaging in good faith discussions with certified minority- or women-owned business enterprises about the nature of the work, scheduling, requirements for special equipment, opportunities for dividing of work among the bidders, proposers, and various subcontractors and the bids of the minority or women businesses, including sharing with them any cost estimates from the request for proposal or invitation to bid documents, if available; and, 
(h)  The burden of proof is on the bidder. Whether or not any such potential contractor made a good faith effort to achieve the utilization goals shall be a question of fact to be decided by the city, acting in its reasonable discretion. A committee composed of a representative from small construction business development program office, the corporation counsel's office, and the bureau of purchasing will evaluate whether such good faith effort was achieved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(i)  The potential contractor shall be required to document their good faith efforts in the form of an affidavit signed by a principal or other authorized person of the contractor and submitted at the pre-award meeting. If the affidavit or other the documentation submitted by the potential contractor does not provide compelling, verifiable evidence of a good faith effort, the bidder will be considered a non- responsive bidder for failing to meet the city's good faith effort requirements, and the bid may be rejected. If a bidder submits more than one (1) non-responsive bid within a twelve-month period, that bidder will be disqualified from all future bids within the next twelve (12) months. 
(j)  If at least one (1) bidder has met the utilization goal or demonstrated a good faith effort, all non-responsive bids will be rejected, and the contract shall be awarded to the bidder who has demonstrated a good faith effort, so long as rejection of the non-responsive bids, in the discretion of the purchasing agent, will not lead to gross inefficiency of public resources 
(k)  If all potential contractors are non-responsive bidders as defined in the provisions of this section, the purchasing agent will have discretion to reject all bids and to rebid the project, or to accept the lowest, non-responsive bidder. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1347, § 8, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-10. - Compliance. 
(a)  Bid specifications or requests for proposals shall require potential contractors to do the following: 
(1)  Demonstrate in their bid or proposal that they have made good faith efforts to utilize MBE subcontractors as required in section 12¼-9; and 
(2)  Identify the particular MBE subcontractors to be utilized in performing the contract, including a signed contract or commitment letter specifying for each subcontractor the dollar value of the participation, the type of work to be performed and such information as may be reasonably required to determine responsiveness of the bid or proposal. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this chapter, bidders not meeting the requirements of this subsection shall be declared non-responsive.

Sec. 12¼-11. - Exceptions. 
(a)  In the event that a city construction contract is funded in whole or in part by the state or federal government or any agency thereof and there is a conflict between the city goals and state or federal goals, the relevant policies and goals of the state or federal government or agency will apply. 
(b)  The utilization goal requirements and set aside provisions will not apply to the following procurements: 
(1)  Construction services that the purchasing agent certifies are available only from a sole source and the prospective contractor is not currently disqualified from doing business with the city or from doing business or with any governmental agency based on a failure to fulfill MBE requirements. Copies of all construction related sole source approvals by the purchasing agent shall be forwarded to the office of economic development small construction business development program and shall serve as the certification of the purchasing agent. 
(2)  Construction contracts certified in writing by the purchasing agent to the office of economic development small construction business development program that are necessary to respond to an emergency situation that is a threat to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(3)  Construction contracts certified in writing by the purchasing agent to the office of economic development small construction business development program that are made through cooperative purchasing arrangements with other governmental entities when, in the judgment of the city purchasing agent such contracts are in the best interest of the city and such arrangements involve competitive purchasing procedures. 
(4)  Construction contracts made in a manner approved by the board of aldermen upon the recommendation of the purchasing agent, where the purchasing agent has advised the board of aldermen in writing that in his opinion it would not be practicable or in the best interest of the city to proceed in accordance with provisions of this chapter and where the board of aldermen shall find that the making of such a contract in such manner is in the best interest of the city. The purchasing agent shall notify in writing the office of economic development small construction development program of the purchasing agent's intent to seek such a finding by the board of aldermen. 
(c)  Any certifications or notices submitted to the office economic development small construction development program under this provision shall be made prior to the contract being awarded or submitted to the board of aldermen for consideration. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-12. - Prompt payment for registered small business enterprises. 
(a)  To improve opportunities for underutilized firms, it is essential for the city to reduce the firm's costs of doing business with the city as a contractor. The city, through its department of finance, will implement a program for registered SBE and MBE firms that will ensure prompt and faster payment of invoices for work performed and accepted by the city. 
(b)  The goal of the city is to pay registered SBEs within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete and proper invoice. The department of finance is required to track the speed of payment to SBEs and MBEs and maintain a record of payment schedules for all city construction contracts. A monthly record of such payments shall also be forwarded to the office of economic development small construction development program. 
(c)  Non-SBE contractors that have achieved a minimum threshold for MBE subcontractor utilization of twenty (20) percent on a current project will also be targeted for fast payment on that particular project, so as to provide an incentive to contractors to use underutilized subcontractors. 
(d)  Following payment by the city to a contractor for a portion of the work required under a city construction contract where such portion of the work comprises all or a portion of the work carried out by a subcontractor which is an SBE, the contractor must pay the subcontractor for the work in question within ten (10) days of its receipt of such payment. However, a contractor may withhold payment if the contractor has a bona-fide reason for doing so, provided that within said ten-day period, the contractor shall notify the affected subcontractor in writing of the reason for withholding payment and shall deliver a copy of such notice to the purchasing agent and the finance director, and shall thereafter take all reasonable steps to promptly settle the dispute. 
(e)  Subcontractors who believe that they are not being paid according to these requirements may submit an inquiry/complaint to the economic development administrator or his/her designee who will record the complaint and perform an investigation if necessary. If a contractor routinely fails to pay subcontractors promptly, the firm may be deemed non-responsive to MBE goals on subsequent bids. 
(Ord. No. 1292, § 1, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 1421, § 1, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1580, § 1, 12-15-08; Ord. No. 1629, 6-7-10; Ord. No. 1773 , 5-18-15)  
Sec. 12¼-13. - Protest procedure.

(e)  Within five (5) working days from the date of its meeting to consider the protest, the contract review committee shall issue a written opinion as to whether the apparent low bid or bidder met the requirements of this chapter. The written opinion shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to both the protesting party or parties and the apparent low bidder, and a copy of said opinion shall be sent to the purchasing agent. 
(f)  The opinion of the contract review committee shall be binding on the purchasing agent. It shall form the basis of the purchasing agent's decision as to whether to proceed with the award of the contract, to award to the next lowest responsible bidder, or to reject all bids and rebid the contract.

Sec. 12½-2. - Findings. 
(a)  The population of New Haven is composed of people of diverse races, genders and gender identities, colors, religious creeds and national origins. It is essential to the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants that those differences serve only as bases of individual and community strength and integrity and not as causes of discrimination, segregation and restricted opportunities. Discrimination and its consequences cost the city and its people dearly. They cause unsafe and unsanitary housing, unemployment and underemployment, and waste of human potential. They also cause increased crime, juvenile delinquency, disease, fire, public disorder, deficiencies in the city's education system, higher welfare costs, and loss of tax revenue. 
(b)  Denial of equal opportunities to any person on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, gender identity or expression, marital status, sexual orientation, age, familial status or national origin, ancestry, or handicap is against the public policy of the state. Government initiative to repair the consequences of past denials of equal opportunities, and to prevent such denials in the future, promotes the state's public policy. Because New Haven's population is more diverse in race, gender and gender identities, color, religion, creed and national origin than the population of less densely populated areas of Connecticut, and the need for intergroup respect and understanding is therefore greater, it is essential that official local action be taken to promote and assure equality of opportunity for all residents of the city. 
(Ord. of 5-14-64, § 2; Ord. of 5-6-74; Ord. of 8-6-90, § 1; Ord. of 1-6-92; Ord. of 6-1-92; Ord. of 3-12-01; Ord. No. 1666, 11-10-11 )  
Sec. 12½-3. - Commission on equal opportunitiesComposition; appointment; terms.

Upon the filing of a complaint, the commission shall inform the complainant of alternative state and federal agencies where they may file the complaint and seek relief in lieu of filing with the commission, and the commission shall inform the complainant of the time frames required by the other state and federal agencies for filing. 
After the filing of a complaint pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall serve upon the person claiming to be aggrieved a notice that: (1) acknowledges receipt of the complaint, and (2) advises of the time frames and choice of forums available under this chapter. 
(b)  Alternatively, the executive director of the commission, whenever he/she has reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed, may issue a complaint and file it with the commission. 
(c)  Any complaint filed pursuant to this section must be so filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the occurrence of alleged discriminatory practice. Prior to commencement of a hearing pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, a complaint may be amended from time to time with the assent of the executive director. 
(d)  The commission shall not receive, or if it has received, it shall cease acting upon, any complaint where a complaint alleging the same discriminatory practice is pending before the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. 
(e)  Within ten (10) days after the filing of any discriminatory practice complaint, or an amendment adding an additional respondent, the commission shall cause the complaint to be served upon the respondent together with a notice: 
(1)  Identifying the alleged discriminatory practice; and 
(2)  Advising of the procedural rights and obligations of a respondent under this chapter. The respondent may file a written answer to the complaint under oath with the commission within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the complaint. The chairperson of the commission shall refer the same to the executive director of the commission, or an investigator to investigate and determine if there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed. As used in this section, "reasonable cause" means a bona fide belief that the material issues of fact are such that a reasonable person could believe the facts alleged in the complaint. With respect to any complaint alleging the denial of full and equal accommodations, the investigation shall commence within thirty (30) days of receipt of the complaint. 
(f)  Before issuing a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, the investigator or executive director shall afford each party and his/her representative an opportunity to provide written or oral comments on all evidence in the commission's file, except as otherwise provided by federal law or any other provision of the general statutes. The commission, its executive director or investigator, shall consider such comments in making its determination. 
(g)  Before issuing a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, the investigator or executive director shall attempt conciliation. But the refusal to accept a settlement shall not be grounds for dismissal of any complaint.

(h)  The commission, executive director or investigator may call a fact-finding conference during the investigatory process for the purpose of ascertaining facts, clarifying issues and promoting the voluntary resolution of any complaint of a discriminatory practice. Said conference may be continued from time to time. At any such fact-finding conference, the complainant and respondent shall have a right to be present, the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative, and the right to present and examine witnesses. The fact-finding conference shall be recorded. The recording shall be available only to the parties for review at the offices of the commission. 
(i)  If the executive director or investigator issues a finding of no reasonable cause, the complainant may request reconsideration of such finding with the commission not later than fifteen (15) days from the issuance of such finding. The commission shall reconsider or reject within ninety (90) days of the issuance of such finding. 
(j)  If the executive director determines, after preliminary investigation of a complaint alleging denial of full and equal accommodations in any housing or other accommodation filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, that there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed or upon the filing of a complaint pursuant to subsection (b) of this section: 
(1)  The executive director may at any time apply to the superior court for the Judicial District of New Haven or any judge therefore for a restraining order or temporary injunction restraining the respondent from any conduct tending to render ineffectual any steps that the commission or the courts may take to eliminate such discriminatory practice, including, but not limited to, restraining the respondent from making unavailable in any way, to the person allegedly discriminated against, the housing or other accommodation with respect to which the alleged discriminatory practice has been committed, and the court or judge thereof may grant such restraining order or temporary injunction upon such terms and conditions as it deems just and proper, pending the final determination of the proceeding under this chapter. 
(2)  The executive director may apply to the superior court for the Judicial District of New Haven to seek an award of compensatory and punitive damages, which damages shall include, but not be limited to, the actual expenses incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternative housing, space, storage of goods and effects, moving, attorney's services, compensation for emotional distress and any other costs actually incurred by the complainant as a result of such unlawful practice. 
(k)  In case endeavors at conference, conciliation or persuasion fail to eliminate such alleged discriminatory practice, the executive director shall promptly certify the complaint and the result of the investigation of the commission. The chairperson of the commission shall thereupon appoint a hearing tribunal of three (3) or more members of the commission to hear such certified complaint, and shall cause to be issued and served in the name of the commission a written notice, together with a copy of such certified complaint to be presented and heard at a hearing before the tribunal, at a time and place to be specified in the notice. The respondent may file a written answer to the certified complaint. The complainant and the respondent may appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit testimony and be fully heard. The tribunal conducting any hearing may permit reasonable amendment to any certified complaint or answer at any time. The tribunal may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of any evidence relevant and material to the subject matter of the certified complaint. Any endeavors or negotiations for conciliation shall not be received in evidence. The testimony taken at such hearing shall be under oath and recorded. 
(l)  If, upon all the evidence, the tribunal finds that a respondent has engaged in any discriminatory practice, it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and file with the commission, and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such action, affirmative or otherwise, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Hiring or reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, provided liability for back pay shall not accrue from a date more than two (2) years prior to the issuance of such complaint, and provided further that interim earnings, including unemployment compensation and welfare assistance, shall be deducted from the back pay to which such person is otherwise entitled; or 
(2)  Restoration to membership in any respondent labor organizations; or 
(3)  Offering housing accommodations for sale or rent, as in the judgment of the tribunal will effectuate the purposes of this chapter; and 
(4)  Attorney's fees, compensatory damages, punitive damages and other actual costs incurred by the complainant. 
If, upon all evidence, the tribunal finds that the respondent has not engaged in any alleged discriminatory practice, it shall state its findings and shall similarly issue, file and serve upon the complainant an order dismissing the complaint. Upon the dismissal of a complaint, the commission shall advise the complainant of his/her right to file a complaint seeking relief with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and the time frame required by the commission on human rights. 
(m)  Any action, including an order, of a hearing tribunal shall be deemed to be an action of the commission. 
(n)  The power granted to the court to issue a restraining order or temporary injunction pursuant to this section is hereby made subject to the same conditions which are set forth in G.S. sections 52-471 and 52-472 for the issuance of restraining orders and temporary injunctions generally; and the commission in making application for such temporary injunction or restraining order shall post bond, with surety satisfactory to the court or judge, which bond shall run in favor of the respondent, to answer all damages in case the commission fails to prosecute the action for which the injunction has been applied; provided a bond need not be required when, for good cause shown, a court or judge is of the opinion that a temporary injunction ought to be issued without bond. 
(o)  With respect to any complaint alleging denial of full and equal accommodations in housing, the complainant shall be informed at the time the complaint is filed of the availability of injunctive relief and may request the executive director to seek same. The executive director shall promptly notify the complainant whether an injunction will be sought. 
(p)  All complaints filed with the commission shall be investigated within one hundred (100) days of filing, and a final administrative disposition shall be made within one (1) year of filing unless it is impracticable to do so. If the commission is unable to complete its investigation or make a final administrative determination within such time frames, it shall notify the complainant and the respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so. 
(q)  The commission shall adopt rules and regulations governing its process for receiving and acting upon complaints. Such rules and regulations shall be reviewed biennially by the commission, and such rules and regulations shall be subject to the approval of the board of aldermen.

ARTICLE III. - RENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILIES OR SINGLE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Cross reference Fair rent practices, ch. 12¾. 
 
Sec. 12½-41. - Findings. 
Discrimination against families with minor children exists in the leasing of housing accommodations within the city. The existence of such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health, safety and welfare of a sizable segment of the community, namely families with children, and is detrimental to the natural diversity of young and old which is essential to community well-being. 
A shortage of housing suitable for families with minor children exists in all rental housing throughout the city. A low vacancy rate exists in all rental housing throughout the city. Yet, the escalating costs of ownership of housing are driving more families into rental housing. The addition of discrimination against families with minor children to the above three (3) factors creates a dangerous situation for the health, safety and welfare of minor children in the city. 
The overall effect of such discrimination is to encourage the flight of families from the city and to further diminish family-oriented neighborhoods. It has an overall detrimental effect on the social composition of family life within the city, the living conditions of our children, the quality of our schools, and the viability of children's activities and organizations. 
This discrimination falls most heavily on families of low and moderate income, but cuts across all racial, ethnic and economic levels.

ARTICLE V. - AIDS DISCRIMINATION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note An ordinance of Jan. 3, 1989 amended Ch. 12½ by adding thereto a new art. V. Designation of §§ 14 of such ordinance as §§ 12½-6112½-64 was at the discretion of the editor. 
 
Sec. 12½-61. - Findings. 
(a)  The medical condition described as acquired immune deficiency syndrome and commonly known as AIDS is a deadly disease which has the potential to affect every segment of our city's population. 
(b)  AIDS was first recognized in 1981 by the federal centers for disease control, based on the study of a pattern of unusual illnesses among the young single men. The opinion of the scientific and medical community is that AIDS is caused by a virus, known as HTLV-III, which attacks and cripples the body's immune system, thereby leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. A person infected with AIDS suffers a variety [of virus-] and/or fungus-caused illnesses which debilitates the body, resulting in a high mortality rate within three (3) years after diagnosis. The spread of the virus has occurred through the exchange of body fluids, i.e., blood, blood byproducts, or semen, between individuals. 
(c)  Medical studies of family groups, in which one or more persons have been diagnosed with AIDS, show no spread of the virus other than through sexual intimacy or through the exchange of blood. No evidence exists to indicate that the virus can be spread by causal contact. 
(d)  The public health danger represented by the virus, and its subsequent manifestations as AIDS, is caused by the lengthy incubation period during which period an apparently healthy individual may spread the disease to other persons through the exchange of blood, blood byproducts, or semen. 
(e)  By its nature, AIDS has created a discrete and vulnerable minority of our citizens who are afflicted with a seriously disabling condition whose ultimate outcome is fatal. Persons afflicted with AIDS represent a segment of our population particularly victimized due to the nature of the disease and to the present climate of misinformation, ignorance, and fear in the general population. Discrimination against persons with AIDS and AIDS-related conditions exists in the City of New Haven. 
(f)  Persons with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions are faced with discrimination in employment, housing, medical and dental services, business establishments, city facilities, city services, and other public accommodations. Such discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic and economic lines. 
(g)  Discrimination against persons with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions poses a substantial threat to the health, public safety, and welfare of the community. Existing state and federal restraints on, and enforcement mechanisms against, such arbitrary discrimination are inadequate to meet the particular problems of this city. 
(Ord. of 1-3-89, § 1)  
Sec. 12½-62. - Definitions. 
The following words and phrases whenever used in this article, shall be construed as defined in this section: 
AIDS means the disease, caused by a virus known as HTLV-III, which destroys the human immune system and damages the body's ability to fight off illness. The term AIDS shall also include AIDS-related conditions, seropositivity and any other medical condition which a person contracts as a result of having AIDS or an AIDS-related condition, including all signs and symptoms of the disease that are manifested in the afflicted person by a series of virus-or fungus-caused illnesses of a chronic nature. The term AIDS shall cover any person who has such medical condition or any one who is assumed or regarded as having such a condition. 
Person means any natural person, firm, corporation, partnership or other organization, association or groups however organized including, but not limited to, the City of New Haven. 
(Ord. of 1-3-89, § 2)  
Sec. 12½-63. - Prohibited activity. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person in the City of New Haven to the deprivation of any constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities, or any other rights and protections in Section 46a-58 of the Connecticut General Statutes, on account of such person having AIDS. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person in the City of New Haven to the deprivation of any rights or protections in Section 46a-59 of the Connecticut General Statutes with respect to associations of licensed persons, Section 46a-60 of the Connecticut General Statutes with respect to employment practices, Section 46a-64 of the Connecticut General Statutes with respect to public accommodations practices, or Section 46a-66 of the Connecticut General Statutes with respect to credit practices, on the account of such persons having AIDS. 
(Ord. of 1-3-89, § 3)  
Sec. 12½-64. - Remedies. 
(a)  The commission on equal opportunities of the City of New Haven shall enforce the provisions of this article in the same manner as set forth in the equal opportunities ordinance, Article I of Chapter 12½ of the Code of General Ordinances of the City of New Haven. 
(b)  Any person who claims to have been injured by any violation of the provisions of this article may file a complaint with the commission on equal opportunities. The procedures for complaints filed under this section shall be the procedures as set forth in section 12½-6 and 12½-7 of Article I of this chapter for complaints filed under the equal opportunities ordinance; provided, however, that any complaint of discrimination involving a person who identifies himself or herself as a person having AIDS or whose complaint involves a claim under this article, shall be processed expeditiously. 
(c)  The commission on equal opportunities shall adopt the procedures consistent with the following sections of the Connecticut General Statutes with regard to confidentiality: Sections 1-19 et seq., 176-225, 19a-215, 19a-25, 19a-499, and other applicable sections, in order to ensure that the identity of persons submitting claims under this article remains confidential. 
(d)  The commission of equal opportunities of the City of New Haven shall adopt procedures which shall be consistent with the purposes and other provisions of this article, to provide written notice to state and local boards, commissions, chapters, departments, and other entities having legal authority under the Connecticut General Statutes or the Charter or Code of Ordinances of the City of New Haven or authority under the bylaws under which such entity operates, to license, certify, review or otherwise regulate the conduct [of] the persons, informing such entities when said commission has found a violation of section 12½-63 of this article by persons whose conduct is subject to the recommendations or actions of such entities.

(2)  The written notice shall request such entities, acting in accord with the statutes, bylaws, and regulations under which they operate, to conduct inquiries, discipline members, and initiate other actions as required when violations of law, bylaws, or professional codes of conduct are alleged; and 
(3)  The written notice shall request such entities to provide to the commission, for incorporation into the permanent public files of said commission, a written statement describing the actions of such entities in response to or as a result of the receipt of the written notice from the commission of a violation of section 12½-63 of this article.

ARTICLE II. - COMMISSION ON DISABILITIES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ordinance of Feb. 11, 1981, §§ 19 provided for the inclusion of Art. II, as set out herein, except that the sections have been designated by the editor as §§ 16½-1116½-18 to conform to the numerical sequence of the Code. 
 
Sec. 16½-11. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the "Commission on Disabilities Article." 
(Ord. of 2-11-81, § 1; Ord. of 4-6-87)  
Sec. 16½-12. - Definitions. 
Unless the context requires otherwise, 
Commission means the commission on disabilities of the City of New Haven. 
Disability means any condition or characteristic that renders a person a "person with disabilities" as defined below. 
Person with disabilities means any person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment. As used herein: 
(a)  Physical or mental impairment means (1) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: Neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory; including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or (2) any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. This term includes, but is not limited to, however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, drug addiction and alcoholism. 
(b)  Major life activities means functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 
(c)  Has a record of such an impairment means has a history of, or has been misclassified as having a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 
(d)  Is regarded as having an impairment means (1) has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities, but that is treated by the commission as constituting such a limitation; or (2) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment. 
(Ord. of 2-11-81, § 2, Ord. of 4-6-87)  
Sec. 16½-13. - Findings. 
Persons with disabilities have for some time be subjected to varying levels of societal indifference and neglect. These conditions have resulted in limiting the rights and participation of persons with disabilities or have otherwise restricted their opportunities for employment, education and community services. Government at all levels is finally recognizing the needs of persons with disabilities. These needs have begun to be addressed by legislation, programs, and various forms of assistance. The responsibility of local government as well as various community institutions and organizations in responding to the needs of persons with disabilities is broad and encompassing. 
The U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare estimates that sixteen (16) per cent of the population of most cities are persons with disabilities. Given the poverty index of New Haven and the health-related consequences of poverty on any disabling condition, it is very likely that the disabled population of New Haven is much higher than the standard sixteen (16) per cent. 
Therefore, it is essential that official local action be taken to promote the effective marshalling of resources and to constructively respond to the needs of persons with disabilities. 
(Ord. of 2-11-81, § 3; Ord. of 4-6-87)  
Sec. 16½-14. - Establishment of the commission. 
There is hereby established a commission on disabilities, consisting of fifteen (15) members appointed by the mayor subject to the approval of the board of aldermen. Commission members shall serve without compensation and shall reside in the City of New Haven. Commission members may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred. Membership on the commission shall include: 
(a)  Seven (7) persons with disabilities who are city residents; 
(b)  Four (4) city residents who are either relatives of persons with disabilities or citizens active in the disabled community; and 
(c)  Four (4) representatives of disabled service agencies, all of which representatives are city residents. 
Of the fifteen (15) members first appointed, five (5) commissioners shall be appointed for a term of three (3) years, five (5) commissioners shall be appointed for a term of two (2) years, and five (5) commissioners shall be appointed for a term of one (1) year. Thereafter, commissioners shall serve three-year terms, however, in the event of a vacancy in the commission's membership, the successor shall be appointed to serve the unexpired term of the vacating member. 
(Ord. of 2-11-81, § 4; Ord. of 4-6-87)

(Ord. of 2-11-81, § 5)  
Sec. 16½-16. - Powers and duties. 
The commission shall perform all duties necessary to effectuate this article, including the following: 
(a)  To seek to reduce both physical and attitudinal barriers confronting persons with disabilities. 
(b)  To establish and maintain cooperative working relationships with public and private agencies serving New Haven persons with disabilities. 
(c)  To study and investigate individual or community problems which limit the rights of persons with disabilities or otherwise restrict their opportunities in employment, housing, economic status, recreation, education, health, transportation, and similar pursuits. 
(d)  To issue reports and publications on its studies, research and investigations to promote public awareness and understanding of disabled problems and needs. 
(e)  To receive complaints and grievances of persons or groups with disabilities. The commission may review, investigate, conciliate and/or refer such complaints or grievances to appropriate city, state and federal agencies or take other appropriate action within the scope of its powers. 
(f)  To work with federal, state, and local agencies as well as private, civic, religious, business, industrial, labor and other organizations, groups and persons to foster the development of programs and services that address the needs of persons with disabilities and increase opportunities and to enable persons with disabilities to live with maximum independence and enhance the quality of life of persons with disabilities. 
(g)  To promote cooperative program planning and development among service providers in order to improve and expand the delivery of services to the city's disabled. 
(h)  To conduct public forums to ascertain the views of the disabled in developing program objectives and setting service priorities to address the needs of the disabled and to raise the public awareness of the concerns of the disabled.

(d)  The residential rental property owner or his/her agent must provide the tenants of such property with at least seven (7) calendar days advanced notice of the inspection. The city will provide the owner or his/her agent with consent forms for each rental unit within the residential rental property. If a tenant objects to such inspection, the city code inspector needs to obtain an administrative warrant from the appropriate official at the Superior Court for the Judicial District of New Haven before the code inspector inspects the non-consenting tenant's unit. 
(e)  The code inspector will use a checklist comprised of housing related criteria to determine whether the residential rental property meets minimum housing code standards and the standards set forth in the city's Anti-Blight and Property Maintenance Ordinance, Section 15-51 et. seq. of the New Haven Code of Ordinances (the "Anti-Blight & Property Maintenance Ordinance") with respect to that criteria.

The license issuer will have copies of the checklist available for the public. 
(f)  For residential rental properties with up to twenty five (25) dwelling units, the code inspector shall inspect one hundred (100) percent of the dwelling units at said Property. For residential rental properties with between twenty-five (25) and ninety-nine (99) dwelling units, the code inspector will have discretion to select and inspect a sampling of dwelling units that shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the total number of dwelling units and the residential rental property, but shall never be less than twenty-five (25) units within the residential rental property. For residential rental properties with one hundred (100) or more dwelling units, the code inspector will have the discretion to select and inspect a sampling of dwelling units that shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of dwelling units at the residential rental property. With respect to the foregoing, such selection of units shall be made by a statistically random process, and is restricted to those dwelling units which have been authorized for inspection by their respective tenants. If the inspected dwelling units fail to pass inspection, the code inspector will have discretion to inspect additional dwelling units in that residential rental property. 
(g)  The code inspector shall fill out an inspection form indicating the status of each of the inspected criteria on the above-referenced checklist. The landlord or his/her agent and the respective tenant shall each receive a copy of the completed form. The city's Livable City Initiative shall keep a copy in its records for public inspection. 
(h)  If the residential rental property passes inspection, the code inspector will immediately notify the owner or his/her agent of the results. A residential rental license certificate will be sent by certified mail to the owner at the address listed in the application form. 
(i)  The code inspector will prepare a list of defects, if any, that he/she finds during the inspection, and give the list to the owner or his/her agent when the inspection is completed. If no life-threatening health and/or safety defect is found, the owner will be given thirty (30) days to repair the defect(s), unless the code inspector or his/her designee deems that more or less time is needed. Once the allowed repair time expires, the code inspector will conduct a re-inspection of the residential rental property. If all previously noted defects have not been repaired, the code inspector or his/her designee will have discretion to provide the owner with additional time to repair the defect(s), or order alternative measure(s), which may include a penalty as described below, and which is prescribed by ordinance section 17-84 of the city's Code of Ordinances. If at the time of the re inspection, the code inspector notes additional defects, not previously noted during the initial inspection, the code inspector shall provide the owner thirty (30) days to repair the newly noted defects, unless the code inspector or his/her designee deems that more or less time is needed. Once the additional allowed repair time expires, the code inspector will again conduct a re-inspection of the residential rental property. 
(j)  If the code inspector finds a life-threatening health and/or safety defect, he/she will immediately inform the owner or his/her agent. The residential rental property license will be denied or revoked, as appropriate, and the endangered tenant(s) may be relocated at the code inspector's discretion and at the city's expense. Any rental unit(s) directly affected by the life-threatening defect(s) shall not be reoccupied unless and until the life-threatening health and/or safety defect is repaired, and the city issues or reinstates the residential rental property license in writing. The owner will be liable to the city for the tenants' relocation costs, including those relating to shelter, moving and storage. These costs must be reimbursed before a license is issued or reinstated. Any owner who fails to reimburse the city for these costs will be penalized in accordance with the penalties section as described below, and in accordance with ordinance section 17-84 of the city's Code of Ordinances. 
(k)  If the code inspector detects at least one (1) defect during the residential rental property inspection, he/she will arrange to re-inspect the property until it fully complies with required housing standards. The owner will not be penalized for the first re-inspection, but will be penalized fifty dollars and zero cents ($50.00), per unit, for each subsequent re-inspection. However, in the event the code inspector notes additional defects, not previously noted in the initial inspection, in any subsequent re inspection, the code inspector shall not penalize the owner for the first re inspection directly related to the additional defect(s) found and the owner shall be penalized for any subsequent re inspection directly related to the additional defect(s) noted. 
(l)  Each tenant shall be responsible for maintaining his/her respective rental unit in a clean and sanitary condition, and abide by all duties imposed on him/her by all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations including the Housing Code of the City of New Haven and the city's Anti Blight & Property Maintenance Ordinance. A tenant will be liable for all damages that he/she causes to the residential rental property. If the code inspector finds that a tenant is responsible for damages that are detected during the inspection of the residential rental property, the inspector may issue a citation and proceed to collect the associated fine as determined by a court proceeding. 
(m)  If repairs are not made within the designated time limit, a fine as authorized and set forth in the Anti-Blight & Property Maintenance Ordinance may be retroactively applied to the date that the residential rental property owner or his/her agent received the completed licensing inspection form identifying the existing defect(s) up to a period of thirty (30) days. 
(n)  No residential rental property license will be issued to a residential rental property owner unless and until the code inspector finds that all defects concerning that property have been repaired.

As to such water sources that are not metered, estimates of water usage will be made. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-15. - Allowance for metered water not discharged into city's sanitary sewer system. 
(a)  Any person owning or having control of property discharging waste into the sanitary sewers of the city and on whose property there is located one or more facilities requiring water, from the source of supply that also furnishes water to the sanitary sewer system, and such water provided to the city, may at his or her own expense install a water meter of a type and design, and at a location, approved by the general manager, and the WPCA will accept readings from such meter taken and provided to the WPCA by such person or his or her duly authorized agent, such readings to be furnished on forms provided by the general manager and sworn to as correct by the person taking the reading. Meters installed for this purpose shall be sealed by the WPCA, and the owners shall ensure that said seal is not broken. 
(b)  The amount of water measured by the reading of such meter will be used to adjust the water usage upon which the user charge established by this chapter will be computed. In the event such property is not supplied water by the company, such meter reading will be deducted from the total water usage furnished to the property as estimated by the general manager as provided for in this chapter. 
(c)  No facility for which a meter is installed under the provisions of this section shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system of the city without the owner thereof having first notified in writing the general manager of such proposed connection. 
(d)  The sewer staff shall have the right, at any time during regular business hours, to check the meter reading on such meter installed to measure the amount of water provided to the facility not discharging waste into the city's sanitary sewers, and to remove and test such meter at any time. 
(e)  Any person making a false affidavit as to the amount of water usage registered by a meter installed under the provisions of this section, or any person representing to the WPCA that the facility for which a meter is installed under the provisions hereof does not discharge waste into the sanitary sewer when, in fact, it does, or any person having facilities for which such a meter is installed who subsequently connects such facility to the city's sanitary sewer system without notifying the general manager shall be guilty of an offense. Each and every day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense punishable as in accordance with section 25-43. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-16. - Engineering study to determine charge for industrial, commercial and institutional users where portion of water not discharged into sewer. 
(a)  The provisions of this section shall apply only to those industrial, commercial and institutional water users who have facilities connected to the sanitary sewers of the city and who make application to the general manager under the provisions hereof. 
(b)  Any industrial, institutional and commercial water user owning or having control of property discharging waste into the sanitary sewers of the city, and on whose property there is located one or more facilities requiring water, from the source of supply that also furnishes water to the sanitary sewer system, and all or part of such water provided to any such facility is not discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city, may make application to the general manager, on forms furnished by the WPCA, requesting that an engineering study of the applicant's property and facilities be made for the hereinafter stated purpose and paying the fee established by the WPCA. 
(c)  Applications made under the provisions of this section shall be upon forms promulgated and furnished by the general manager, and the applicant shall furnish all the information and other matters requested therein. The fee for making the first application under the provisions hereof shall be as established and revised from time to time by the WPCA. No fee shall be required for studies initiated by the general manager subsequent to the first application. The fee is to reimburse the WPCA for the expense of making the engineering study and report. Each applicant shall agree, as a condition precedent to the general manager conducting the study and tests provided for herein, including those initiated by the general manager, to indemnify and hold harmless the WPCA of and from any and all such liability for any acts or omissions by the WPCA, its agents and employees committed while conducting the engineering studies and tests provided for herein, causing or resulting in damages to the property or person of the applicant, his or her agents, employees and invitees. 
(d)  Upon receipt of an application and the fee required herein, the general manager will, as soon as possible, make an engineering study of the applicant's property and facilities. In those instances where, in the opinion of the general manager based upon an engineering study of the property and facilities of the applicant, it is impractical or infeasible for the applicant to install one or more meters to measure the amount of water passing through the water meter serving such property and not being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city, the general manager is authorized to make an engineering study to determine the percentage of the amount of water passing through such meter that is being discharged into the sanitary sewer of the city. A report of such determination, showing the basis thereof, shall be certified to by the general manager, and one copy shall be filed with the WPCA and one copy shall be retained by the general manager. Such report when so filed, shall constitute the basis upon which the sewer service charge established by this chapter shall be computed. 
(e)  The general manager is authorized, at his discretion or on written request from an applicant, to make such additional engineering studies from time to time of any such property and facilities to check the current accuracy of the filed report on any such property, and if it is then determined that the filed report's annual estimated sewage volume is now estimated to differ by more than five (5) percent, a new report based upon the latest studies shall be filed with the WPCA to replace the prior one. A complete copy of each such report shall be retained by the general manager. No change in the basis of computing the sewer service charge for any property will be made until the first billing date after the filing by the general manager with the WPCA of the first or any subsequent report. Requests by an applicant for a restudy under the provisions hereof will not be accepted or acted on more than once in every twelve-month period (annually) subsequent to the filing of the first report on the applicant's property, except when a substantial or material change in a condition or operation of the applicant's property or facilities renders the then-current filed report and the charges based thereon no longer applicable to the applicant's facilities. 
(f)  In the event the general manager determines it is necessary that certain testing instruments be installed, or the existing equipment or facilities located on the applicant's property be altered, adjusted, disconnected or temporarily moved in order to facilitate the making of an engineering study or test under the provisions of this section, all of the foregoing shall be done by and at the expense of the applicant. 
(g)  When the general manager has, as a result of an engineering study made under the provisions of this section, determined the percentage of metered water passing through the water meters serving a property that is being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city, or when the amount of metered water passing through the water meter serving such property and which is not being discharged into the city's sanitary sewers is determined from a water meter installed to measure the amount of such water, billings by the WPCA for sanitary sewer service to such property made prior to such determination shall be reviewed for the purpose of making whatever adjustment is necessary in order to charge such customer only for the amount of metered water that is or has been discharged into the city's sanitary sewers. No adjustment shall be made in excess of that determined to be proper from such engineering study or from the metering of water that is not discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city. Once the proper percentage of adjustment has been determined and certified to the WPCA under the provisions of this section, all subsequent adjustment of water usage for sanitary sewer service charge purposes shall be computed only on the certified basis of adjustment currently on file with the WPCA. 
(h)  The general manager, may, in the exercise of his discretion, deny an application to conduct a study authorized by this section, for any reason, including a finding by other methods adopted by the general manager to reflect differences in the amounts of metered potable water and estimated waste water discharges for the purpose of assessing user charges. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-17. - Billing where company does not supply water for all multiple living unit connections.

Sec. 25-19. - Billing. 
(a)  Billing for sewer service charges shall be made to the sewer customers of the WPCA generally concurrently with the monthly or quarterly water bills issued by the company to such customers. Those persons without water meters or with a source of water supply other than the company will be billed periodically. 
(b)  All sewer user charges shall be due and payable in full on or before ten (10) days after the date of the mailing of the bill to the person. Any sewer use charge not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the due date shall be delinquent and shall bear interest from the due date at the rate and in the manner provided by the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut for delinquent property taxes. There shall be indicated on each bill the late (last) date on which the same may be paid without becoming subject to the interest charge, together with a statement to the effect that if the bill is not paid within thirty (30) days from the due date, it will become subject to interest from the due date at the applicable rate. The WPCA shall exercise due diligence to collect the full amount due. The WPCA may consider accounts, in its discretion, uncollectible or may in its discretion compromise the amount due. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-20. - Collection procedures. 
(a)  In addition to other collection procedures provided herein, the general manager may retain independent legal counsel, and/or an independent collecting agent, as selected by the WPCA, for the collection by all lawful means of any delinquent unpaid sewer use charges as defined and revised from time to time by the WPCA. A list of said unpaid accounts turned over for collection shall be provided semi-annually to the chairman of the WPCA. 
(b)  Any unpaid sewer user charges shall constitute a lien upon the real estate against which such charge was levied from the date it became delinquent. Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided by the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut for continuing, recording and releasing property tax liens and encumbrances except taxes, and may be foreclosed in the same manner as a lien for property taxes. The WPCA shall designate a person as the collector of the sewer use charges, and such collector may collect such charges in accordance with the provisions of the General Statutes, aforesaid, for the collection of property taxes. The general manager will prepare a list of accounts deemed uncollectible in whole or in part, with recommendations as: 
(1)  Write-off as uncollectible; 
(2)  Compromise amount of payment. 
Said list shall be submitted to the WPCA for review and approval. 
(c)  Delinquent unpaid sewer user charges collected by independent counsel and/or collecting agency shall be increased to include all fees and charges of the collection agent applicable to the unpaid sewer use charges. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-21. - Adjustment of bill. 
(a)  In the event any adjustment in a water bill affects the basis on which the city sewer charge is levied for the same period, an appropriate adjustment in the sewer charge shall be made by a credit or additional charge on the next bill. In all cases, the general manager shall certify to the WPCA the validity of each adjustment. 
(b)  The general manager may permit adjustments to a user's sewer bill for various reasons under provisions of rules, regulations and guidelines that may be adopted from time to time by the WPCA.

The WPCA shall have the right to discontinue sanitary sewer service to any person discharging into the sanitary sewers of the city who fails or refuses to make timely payment of the sewer charges for which he is billed; provided, however, in the event of a dispute as to the amount of charges made, service shall not be terminated if the person charged deposits with the WPCA the amount of such charges on the condition that, upon the review of the dispute and decisions thereof by a body designated by WPCA, which decision shall be final, any amount such body finds the customer is entitled to have refunded shall be returned to him or her, and the balance thereof shall be applied to satisfy the disputed charges. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-23. - Continued use of sewer after refusal to pay. 
Any person failing or refusing to pay the charges provided for in this chapter, or to deposit the proper sum in the event of a dispute as to the amount of such charges in the time and manner provided, and who continues to discharge waste water from his property into the sanitary sewer systems of the city, shall be guilty of an offense and shall be punished in the manner provided for in section 25-43. Each and every day that such violation continues shall constitute separate offense and shall be punishable as such. The conviction of a person for such an offense shall not be a bar to the institution by the WPCA of a suit for the collection of the delinquent charges and for an injunction to enjoin such person from discharging waste into the sanitary sewer system of the city without complying with the provisions of this article and paying the charges established hereby. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-24. - Implementation of chapter. 
(a)  All provisions of this chapter shall become effective upon their passage in accordance with Section 8(b) and Section 38 of the City Charter. 
(b)  The general manager may establish estimated volumes and characteristics of sewage flow based on best available data prior to the completion of engineering studies to serve as the temporary basis for determining sewer use charges until such engineering studies are completed. Charges so determined shall be adjusted for the entire period of application, up or down, at the time of the first billing after completion of the required engineering study. In any event, all users shall be liable for full payment of all sewer user charges for sewer service rendered after July 1, 1979.

(c)  If the sewer staff discovers a violation of a permit condition, the general manager will give written notice of such violation to the permittee, and the permittee shall, within five (5) days after receipt of such notice, furnish the general manager a description, in writing, of the action which will be taken to effectuate correction of such violation. The violation shall be corrected within five (5) days after the occurrence of such violation unless a different time schedule for correction is approved by the general manager. 
(d)  No provision contained in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent any contract authorized by the WPCA in the usual manner between the WPCA and any industrial waste discharger whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or characteristic may be accepted by the WPCA for treatment when the industrial waste will not be discharged directly into the city's sanitary sewer system but will be delivered directly to the waste water treatment plant, and which will not violate or cause a violation of federal or state discharge standards and which will not be harmful to the waste water treatment plant or the treatment process. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-30. - Quantity determination. 
(a)  Unless otherwise provided, the quantity of waste water delivered to the city sewers will be construed as being the same as the water delivered to the producer by the company water system. If it is ascertained that the water meter has inaccurately measured the amount of water delivered to the permittee, then and in that event the sanitary sewer charge established herein shall be adjusted in the same manner as adjustments are made to the water bill. 
(b)  Should the producer evaporate or otherwise dispose of water delivered by the company water system other than to the city sewer system, the industrial waste producer may avail himself of the provisions of section 25-15 and section 25-16. 
(c)  Under the provisions of section 25-15, it shall be the obligation of the permittee to conduct a test on the flow measuring equipment as follows: meters measuring four and five-tenths (4.5) ccf or greater per day shall be tested at least once every twelve (12) months; meters measuring four and forty-nine-one-hundredths (4.49) ccf or less per day shall be tested at least once every four (4) years. The test shall be used to determine the meter accuracy and the results thereof shall be furnished in writing to the general manager. It shall also be the permittee's responsibility to notify the general manager within a reasonable time in advance so that the general manager may, if he chooses, have a witness present during such test. If, upon any such test, the percentage of accuracy is found to be within the accuracy tolerance established by the manufacturer's specifications, such measuring equipment shall be determined to have correctly measured the quantity delivered to the sewer system. If, however, upon any such test, the percentage of accuracy is found to be in excess of the accuracy tolerance specified by the manufacturer's specifications, then such measuring equipment shall be immediately adjusted to register correctly the quantity delivered to the sewer system. The billings to such permittee shall be adjusted for a period extending back to the time when the inaccuracy began, if such time is ascertainable, or for a period extending back one-half of the time elapsed since the date of the last test or the date of the last adjustment, if the time is not ascertainable. 
(d)  Any producer for which the water supply is from private wells shall install, operate and maintain at its expense such meters or other devices as are necessary to determine quantity discharge to the sewer system. Such meters shall be approved by the general manager. 
(e)  In the event none of the above provisions are applicable, all producers for which the water supply is from other than the company, shall furnish to the WPCA either a certified meter reading of water delivered to its plant or company or a copy of the billing from the water supplier. In this event, the permittee's charges will be calculated and the same conditions will apply as if the company were the supplier of water to the permittee. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-31. - Quality determination. 
(a)  Determination of the average concentration or strength of the waste delivered shall be the obligation of the WPCA, and tests made on representative average samples shall be made at such intervals as the WPCA may designate, not less than annually. The cost of all such analyses required by the general manager shall be borne by the permittee. 
(b)  Samples may be taken and tests made at the WPCA's option without notice to the permittee, and such tests' results made by the WPCA shall fix the applicable user charge established herein; provided, however, a permittee may request in writing that its user charge be established pursuant to a composite sample secured and analyzed by an independent laboratory approved by the WPCA. Such request must be approved in writing by the general manager. If approved by the general manager, all costs of such composite sampling and subsequent analysis shall be borne by the permittee and shall be conducted at intervals determined by the general manager. The WPCA approval of sampling and analysis permitted by an independent laboratory shall not prevent representatives of the sewer staff from taking additional samples at its option without notice to the permittee. 
(c)  Written notice from the general manager approving sampling and analysis by an independent laboratory to establish user charges hereunder may be cancelled by the general manager by giving written notice of such cancellation to the permittee. 
(d)  Sampling shall be conducted according to customarily accepted methods. If, after receiving the permit application, the general manager determines that the operations or characteristics of the producer's industrial waste water discharge requires composite sampling; the general manager may require same, which shall be provided by the producer on the basis of an average work day. Otherwise, the analysis will be made on the basis of grab samples. Guidelines for the examination and analysis of the characteristics will be as recommended in "Standard Methods." The WPCA may select an independent firm or laboratory to determine flow, BOD and suspended solids at the permittee's expense. 
(e)  The general manager may make periodic tests to determine the quality of waste being discharged into the city sewer from the premises of permit holders under the provisions hereof. If at any time the industrial process changes or the quality of the industrial waste water changes such that the addition, modifications or alteration of pretreatment is required to meet city standards, the general manager will then have the authority to require that approved pretreatment facilities be installed by the permit holder. Should any permit holder fail or refuse to install such facilities or initiate their installation to the satisfaction and approval of the general manager within the dates and time specified in the permit, the general manager shall have the authority to suspend or revoke such permit and to terminate sewer service to such premises until such time as the permit holder has completed with the requirements hereof, and take other action as may be permitted under section 25-42 and section 25-43. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-32. - Standard of quality of discharge. 
(a)  Unless otherwise required or approved, the delivery of all industrial waste water from the producer to the city sanitary sewer shall be at a reasonably uniform rate, as provided, without storage by the producer, except that storage which is necessary in the pretreatment plan of the producer. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged any subsurface drainage, storm or groundwater, downspout or roof runoff, yard sprinklers, drains, fountains or ponds into any sanitary sewer, excluding combined sewers. Water from swimming pools, boiler drains, blow-off pipes or cooling water from various types of equipment may be discharged into the sanitary sewer by an indirect connection whereby such discharge is cooled, if required, and flows into the sanitary sewer at a rate not to exceed the design capacity of the sanitary sewer, provided that the waste water does not contain materials or substances in suspension or solutions in violation of the limits prescribed by this chapter. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged into any city sewer any of the following described substances, materials, waters or wastes: 
(1)  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius).

No permit issued under the provisions hereof shall be assignable, and a violation of this provision shall be grounds for summary suspensions or revocation of such permit by the general manager. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-35. - Pretreatment. 
(a)  Pretreatment will be required in the following instances, and the general manager shall submit to the applicant the pretreatment levels which must be obtained: 
(1)  If the general manager determines upon the initial application for a permit under this chapter that the industrial waste water must be pretreated by the applicant to lower the level of any of the components of the industrial waste water before discharge to the city sewer. 
(2)  If the WPCA must improve the discharge from the waste water treatment plant to the receiving waters as a result of directives from federal or state regulatory agencies, orders or judgments from courts of competent jurisdiction or changes in the discharge permit for the WPCA's waste water treatment plant or plants, then and in that event, the general manager will require that a permit holder install or enlarge pretreatment facilities to lower the affected component of the permittee's industrial waste water discharge. 
(3)  If any waste waters prohibited under the conditions of this chapter are produced, such producer shall pretreat the waste water to the extent required to comply with the standards established herein before discharging to any city sewer. 
(4)  If the general manager determines that a permittee, because of plant expansion and/or changes in plant operations, has increased either the strength or volume of discharge, the general manager may require additional pretreatment to lower the level of the volume and/or any components of the industrial waste water before discharge. Pretreatment facilities required under the foregoing subsections of this section shall be provided, operated and maintained at the permit holder's expense. 
(b)  Any sludge or other material removed from the industrial waste water by the pretreatment facility shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. 
(c)  Dilution of waste water discharged to the city sanitary sewer system is prohibited, whether accomplished by the combination of two (2) or more waste water streams by a producer or producers or by the addition of other liquids solely for the purpose of diluting the quality of the waste water discharge. 
One or more producers may, upon application and approval by the general manager, combine industrial waste water streams prior to discharge to the city sanitary sewer system if, and only if, such combination of industrial waste water streams produces a combined discharge of better quality than the two (2) industrial waste water streams would have been if discharged separately. 
(d)  Detailed plans showing any proposed pretreatment facilities shall be submitted to the general manager for approval before construction of the facilities. The review of such plans will in no way relieve such permit holders from the responsibility of modifying and operating the facilities to produce an effluent complying with the established conditions of the permit. Any subsequent significant changes in the approved facilities or method of operating shall be reported to the general manager and must be reviewed and approved by him as complying with the provisions herein established. 
(e)  After the construction plans for such pretreatment plants have been approved and a permit issued, the plans shall be placed on file in permanent, reproducible form, with the general manager, without cost to the WPCA or city, before a building permit will be issued. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-36. - Testing waste water. 
(a)  It is a condition of the permit that the WPCA may at any time test any of the waste water being discharged by the company or plant for quality or quantity.

(b)  The cost of operation shall be recomputed no less often than annually to reflect increases or decreases in operation and maintenance costs and annual debt service, and billing rates shall be revised by the WPCA. 
(Ord. of 10-4-82)  
Sec. 25-40. - Computation of industrial user charges. 
(a)  The user charges to be determined for all permitted manufacturing or other producers of waste water to which this chapter applies, except for dry industries, will be computed by the use of the following formula: 
UC = V [X + Y (BOD) + Z (TSS)]. 
UC 	= 	User charge (in dollars) for each billing period. 
V 	= 	Volume in ccf discharged to the City sanitary sewer system during the billing period. 
X 	= 	Cost per ccf of waste water treated. 
Y 	= 	Cost to remove one mg/l of BOD per ccf. 
Z 	= 	Cost to remove one mg/l of TSS per ccf. 
 
(b)  Those industries defined herein as dry industries, or industries producing wastes containing both BOD and TSS or less than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l, will pay a sewer service charge as established and revised from time to time by the WPCA. 
(c)  When either BOD or TSS in a discharged waste water is more than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l, the formula in subsection (a) will be used, but in no event will either be used at less than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l in the computations. 
(d)  When an industry produces both domestic and process waste water with one connection to the sewer system, the waste water so delivered will be considered as industrial waste water and the user charge computations will be in compliance with (a) and (b) above, based on the combined volume, BOD and TSS content. 
(e)  A permittee may reduce his user charge rate by greater removals in pretreatment or plant operation procedure, but once the pretreatment or plant procedure is established to obtain a uniform or lower rate, written consent from the general manager to increase the delivered strength shall be required, and charges for a higher rate based on tests by the WPCA may be made without other notice to the permittee. 
(f)  Monthly billing or quarterly billing for industrial waste water disposal will be accomplished, using the established procedures.

Low and moderate income housing means housing, the construction or rehabilitation of which is aided or assisted in any way by any federal or state statute, which housing is subject to regulation or supervision or rents, charges or sale prices and methods of operation by a governmental agency under a regulatory agreement or other instrument which restricts occupancy of such housing to persons or families whose incomes do not exceed prescribed limits. 
Owner means a person or persons, partnership, joint venture, or corporation who or which has executed, or will execute, a regulatory agreement or other instrument with a governmental agency, either federal, state or local, which limits occupancy of the low and moderate income housing owned or to be owned by such person or persons, partnership, joint venture or corporation to persons or families whose income do not exceed prescribed limits. 
(b)  Contracts for abatement. The mayor may, with the approval of the board of aldermen, enter into contracts for the city with owners of low and moderate income housing, granting abatement, in whole or in part, of the taxes on the real estate used for such low and moderate income housing. The amount of such abatement shall be established in each such contract, giving due consideration to the purpose or purposes to which the money equivalent of the taxes so abated is to be applied. Each such contract shall require that the owner apply the money equivalent of the taxes so abated to one or more of the following specified purposes: (1) to reduce rents below the levels which would be achieved in the absence of abatement; (2) to improve housing quality and design; (3) to effect occupancy by persons and families of varying income levels, within prescribed limits; or (4) to provide necessary related facilities or services. 
(c)  Term. The abatement shall become effective on the date specified in the contract between the city and an owner of low and moderate income housing. The term of abatement shall extend for the remainder of the fiscal year in which abatement becomes effective and may continue for a period not to exceed thirty-nine (39) consecutive fiscal years thereafter; provided, that such abatement shall terminate at any time when the property for which tax abatement has been granted is not used solely for low and moderate income housing; and provided, further, that the continuation of such abatement may be conditioned upon the continuation of state reimbursement to the city for such abatement. The abatement authorized herein shall be granted only for low and moderate income housing upon which construction or rehabilitation commenced after July 1, 1967. Any contract heretofore entered into between the City of New Haven and an owner of low and moderate income housing may be amended by the parties to extend the period of abatement up to thirty-nine (39) years in accordance with this section. 
(d)  State assistance. The mayor shall, with the approval of the board of aldermen, executed on behalf of the city contracts with the state for financial assistance by the state in the form of reimbursement for the tax abatement granted to an owner of low and moderate income housing in accordance with this section 28-4.

Determination of which historical or architecturally meritorious structures shall be eligible for potential tax abatement shall be made by the aldermanic committee on tax abatement after written recommendation of the city plan commission and the New Haven Preservation Trust. 
(c)  To whom abatement available; committee to request advisory reports. Such tax abatement shall be available to the owners of real property which is so classified if upon petition and after public hearing it can be shown to the satisfaction of the aldermanic committee on tax abatement with the current level of taxation as a material factor which threatens the continued existence of the structure, necessitating either its demolition or remodeling in a manner which destroys the historical or architectural value. In reaching their decision, the aldermanic committee on tax abatement shall request from the city plan commission, the New Haven Preservation Trust and from the New Haven Historic District Commission, where appropriate, a written recommendation as to whether the required relief should be granted. Such advisory reports shall be available at the time of the public hearing. 
(d)  Payment of taxes, interest when structure demolished, remodeled. If, after taxes on such structure have been abated under the terms of this section, such structure is demolished or remodeled in a way which destroys its architectural or historical value, the then owners shall pay to the City of New Haven an amount equal to the total amount of taxes which had been abated under the provisions of this section, plus reasonable interest thereon as determined by the aldermanic committee on tax abatement. 
(e)  Contracts for state financial assistance. The City of New Haven may enter into a contract for state financial assistance for structures of historical and architectural merit in the form of reimbursement for tax abatement according to the terms of Section 12-127a of the Connecticut General Statutes. Such contract shall provide that payments shall be made annually in an amount equal to the difference between the taxes that would be paid on such property were there no abatement and the taxes actually paid by the owners and that in consideration of such grant-in-aid the municipality shall abate taxes to the agreed amount during the period of the contract.

No business shall be deemed ineligible for participation because it operates the child day care facility through a subsidiary incorporated and functioning solely to effect such operation when the only advantages to the business of such subsidiarization are (1) to enhance the administration of such facility and (2) to limit the liability of the business for the actions or negligence of the subsidiary or its employees or agents. 
(b)  Exemption provided. Any business which participates in the program shall receive exemption of one hundred (100) percent of the assessed value of the otherwise taxable real property of the business used exclusively in providing child day care services at a designated facility, provided that the business must be the taxpayer responsible for the payment of city taxes which (in the absence of the exemption provided by this section) would become due with respect to such property. Each such exemption shall be valid for a single year. No such exemption may be transferred to another business, facility, or location. 
(c)  Financial assistance. Any business which participates in the program shall provide financial assistance, in the form of reductions in the tuition payable by the parents or guardians of children enrolled in the child day care service, with a total value each year equal to not less than twenty-five (25) percent of the tax savings obtained by the business for the same year as a result of the exemption received under the program. The financial assistance required by this subsection shall be provided only to families, residing in New Haven, whose incomes do not exceed two hundred (200) percent of the poverty level determined by the appropriate state authority. The business shall advertise the requirement for and availability of the financial assistance. 
(d)  Application. Any business wishing to apply for participation in this program shall do so in writing, using such form or forms as the human resources administrator shall provide for such purpose or (if such forms are not provided) on the letterhead of the applicant.

(4)  A copy of its valid license, issued by the appropriate state authority, to operate the child day care facility on the property for which the exemption is requested; and 
(5)  A list showing the name and address of each child presently enrolled in the facility, with one notation stating the number of such children who are minorities and a second notation stating the number of families of such children whose incomes do not exceed two hundred (200) percent of the poverty level; and 
(6)  Evidence that the facility is accredited by or is in the process of applying for accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children; and 
(7)  Brochures, advertising copy, or other materials used to market the service; and 
(8)  A list of all property, real or personal, owned by it which is located within the city, with a statement that no tax payments pertaining to those properties are delinquent; and 
(9)  In an instance where the business has previously applied for or received the exemption, such other information as the human resources administrator may require to ensure that deficiencies, if any, have been satisfactorily addressed; and 
(10)  An oath, acknowledged in accord with chapter 6 of said statutes, that the statements made and information provided in or with the application is true and complete to the best knowledge of the owner or officer submitting the application. 
It shall be the responsibility of the human resources administrator, acting with the assistance of such other city officials as may be appropriate, to determine whether the business has satisfied the requirements, and is therefore eligible in principle for participation in the program as established by this section. The business shall provide such additional information or documentation as the human resources administrator may deem necessary to fulfill the responsibilities imposed by this section. The information and documentation enumerated hereinbefore shall be submitted to the human resources administrator within fifteen (15) days of the effective date of this section [February 6, 1992] for businesses requesting the exemption for the grand list of October 1, 1991, and no later than the fifteenth day of September annually thereafter for businesses requesting the exemption for the grand list next following that date. 
(e)  Assessment. The human resources administrator shall deliver to the city assessor, within fifteen (15) days following the applicable deadline specified in subsection (d) hereinbefore, the application of any business deemed eligible for participation in the program. The city assessor shall demarcate and value the real property of the business used exclusively in providing child day care services, and shall exempt the assessment on such property (if any) from taxation for the tax year corresponding to the grand list then in preparation. An applicant may be required to provide such other information or documentation as the city assessor may deem necessary to enable him to fulfill the responsibilities imposed upon him by this subsection or other applicable laws. A business dissatisfied with the determinations of the city assessor pursuant to this section may appeal those determinations in the manner provided by law. 
(f)  Reporting. For each exemption granted pursuant to subsection (e) hereinbefore, the business receiving it shall submit to the human resources administrator by the fifteenth day of June next following the grand list date, and by the fifteenth day of December and June during the tax year in which the exemption is effective, a report on its compliance with all of the requirements of this section. The human resources administrator shall compile all such reports and shall communicate them, with such comments as he may deem appropriate, to the board of aldermen promptly thereafter. The city assessor shall include each exemption granted pursuant to this section in the annual report required by section 2½-7(c) of this Code of General Ordinances. 
(g)  Voiding of exemption. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the exemption granted to a business by the city assessor pursuant to this section shall be null and void: 
(1)  If, at the time of preparation of the tax bills for the tax year in which the business has been granted the exemption or at any subsequent time during such tax year, the business is or becomes delinquent in its payment of any taxes due to the City of New Haven; or 
(2)  If the business loses its license (by suspension, revocation, or expiration) from the state to operate the child day care facility; or 
(3)  If the business ceases to operate the child day care facility.

(3)  For a property owner otherwise eligible for a "freeze' of real property taxes under this Ordinance, the amount of the real property tax increase in any given year over the previous year that is eligible for a "freeze" shall be limited to two thousand dollars ($2,000.00).

The grantee shall be required within a period not exceeding ten (10) days immediately following the date of such conveyance to notify the city assessor thereof, or in the absence of such notice, upon determination by the assessor that such conveyance has occurred, the assessor shall determine the amount of tax relief benefit to which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to the interest in real property conveyed and notify the tax collector of the reduced amount of the benefit. Upon receipt of such notice from the assessor, the tax collector shall, if notice is received after the tax due date, no later than ten (10) days thereafter mail or hand a bill to the grantee stating the additional amount of tax due as determined by the assessor. Such tax shall be due and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than thirty days after the date such bill is mailed or handed to the grantee and in equal amounts in any remaining installments as the same are due and payable.

(2)  In the opinion of the appointing official, a person capable of fairly administering the applicable provisions of law based on such person's background and experience, including but not limited to his education, special skills and training, and history of criminal and motor vehicle violations. 
Any hearing officer whose personal interests do or may give the appearance of conflict with his official responsibilities herein enumerated shall remove himself from presiding over any such hearing, and in such case the appointing official shall appoint a substitute hearing officer for the hearing. Any hearing officer may be removed at any time by the appointing official for whatever reason such official deems sufficient. 
(c)  The city may, at any time within two (2) years from the expiration of the final period for the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any alleged violation under any ordinance adopted pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes section 7-148 or sections 14-305 to 14-308 inclusive, send notice to the motor vehicle operator, if known, or the registered owner of the motor vehicle by first class mail at his address according to the parking violation records of the city, or the registration records of the department of motor vehicles.

(d)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (c) wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by the city. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. 
Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten (10) days of the date of the first notice provided for in subsection (c) shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the designated city official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer.

(e)  Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of notice, unless an earlier date is agreed to by the person requesting the hearing, and provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance.

A designated city official, other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the city.

The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he determines that the person is liable for the violation, he shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances of the city. 
(f)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall turn all records of the proceedings over to the parking enforcement administrator, who may instruct the city to use any and all legal means to collect fines and penalties due: Such means may include (but not be limited to): 
(1)  Use of a collection agency; 
(2)  Civil proceedings;

In addition, all users shall obtain a permit from the department of public works for each vehicle used for such solid waste disposal. The director of the department of public works shall use his/her discretion in granting licenses and permits. Said director shall consider the applicant's record of compliance with this article, and any relevant state and federal laws and regulations in making this evaluation. The fee for such licenses and permits shall be in accordance with this Code as amended from time to time. Such license and permit shall have a one (1) year term, and shall expire one (1) year from the date of issuance. The controller shall cause a cost of service study to be undertaken at least annually to establish the true costs of providing solid waste disposal services, and the establishment of a per unit fee sufficient to cover those costs for the city and the city's customers. City customers shall be governmental, quasi-governmental, private and other organizations that deliver or cause appropriate waste to be delivered to the solid waste disposal facility that the city bills in order to qualify for the solid waste disposal services. The director of the department of public works must approve of these customers before they can participate in this service. The board of aldermen must approve of any changes in the per unit fee for the city and city customers. Once such approval is given, changes will take effect thirty (30) days after the controller publishes notice of them in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

In the latter case, the controller may require customers to post a security deposit in a specified form and in an amount equivalent to between two (2) months and six (6) months of the city customer's average monthly disposal at the solid waste disposal facility. 
The total cost will be based on the average of charges imposed on the customer for the last six (6) months.

The controller, in consultation with the director of the department of public works, shall issue regulations concerning methods of payment and provisions for return of security deposits, and make all determinations concerning disputed billings.

Personnel expenses incurred in the general fund, which are associated with the operation of the facility, and properly allocable to activities specified in subsection (a) hereinabove, shall be allocated at least annually to the fund. Any unexpended balance in the fund at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund, and be carried forward as allowed by Conn. General Statutes section 7-148(2)(k) as amended from time to time. 
(iii)  The director of the department of public works shall prepare a quarterly report with the assistance of the controller or his/her designee, and submit it to the board of aldermen before the third Monday of October, January, April and July. The report shall state revenues earned and expenditures incurred through the end of the most recent quarter, project revenues and expenditures through the end of the fiscal year, and compare those to the budget approved by the board. 
(iv)  Sums appropriated by the board of aldermen for the facility's operation and/or maintenance may be used to supplement expenditures from the fund, but such sums shall not be added to the fund unless the board has appropriated them.

Any person who is assessed a civil penalty pursuant to this subsection may appeal such assessment to the Superior Court in the manner provided in Conn. General Statutes sections 7-152b (g) as amended from time to time.

The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his decisions at the end of the hearing. If he determines that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly.

The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment in the amount of such record against such person in favor of the city. Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person. 
(f)  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to section 52-259 of the General Statutes, in the superior court for the geographical area in which New Haven is located, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the superior court.

For those levies and budgets subsequent to the initial levy and budget resultant from this section, the said levy shall be based on an estimated annual budget for the provision of services within the district, which budget shall be approved by a majority of the board, who shall hold a duly noticed public hearing within the district on said proposed budget at least thirty (30) days prior to transmitting said recommended tax levy to the board of alderman, which transmission shall be at least sixty (60) days before the budget takes effect. 
(b)  The board of commissioners at such meeting may recommend to the board of aldermen a levy on each taxable interest in real property in the district, which for each taxable interest shall be the total recommended levy multiplied by a factor equal to the assessed value of the particular property divided by the total assessed value of taxable property in the district. Special assessments to be levied on behalf of the district shall not exceed three-quarters of one percent (.75%) of the assessed value of properties of the district appearing on the City of New Haven Grand List, unless upon prior approval by a majority of all holders of record of taxable interests in real property in the district.

The city shall transfer to the district only such funds as shall be collected.

Any provisions of the city's general statutes, special acts or charter to the contrary notwithstanding, the treasurer of the city shall disburse such moneys in accordance with an annual budget adopted by the board. A quarterly financial report, based on the fiscal year July through June, of all district revenues and expenditures shall be submitted to the controller of the City of New Haven within thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter. 
(e)  Pursuant to Section 12-20c C.G.S, the city shall pay into the fund established by section 35-4(d) of this chapter that portion of the payment from the state in lieu of special services district taxes which would have been received except for the exemption provided to an institution of higher learning or general hospital facility under the provisions of Section 12-81 C.G.S. for all properties which join the Chapel West Special Services District after September 30, 2006, or existing district properties which become exempt from taxation after September 30, 2006.

Sec. 36-4. - Real property levy. 
(a)  The board shall, at its first meeting following the initial election of members of the board, and thereafter at the annual meeting and following the election of members of the board, meet for the purpose of recommending to the board of aldermen of the City of New Haven the imposition of a levy upon the taxable interests in real property within the district. 
For those levies and budgets subsequent to the initial levy and budget resultant from this section, the said levy shall be based on an estimated annual budget for the provision of services within the district, which budget shall be approved by a majority of the board, who shall hold a duly noticed public hearing within the district on said proposed budget at least thirty (30) days prior to transmitting said recommended tax levy to the board of aldermen, which transmission shall be at least sixty (60) days before the budget takes effect. 
(b)  The board at such meeting may recommend to the board of aldermen a levy on each taxable interest in real property in the district, which for each taxable interest shall be the total recommended levy multiplied by a factor equal to the assessed value of the particular property divided by the total assessed value of taxable property in the district. Special assessments to be levied on behalf of the district shall not exceed three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the assessed value of properties of the district appearing on the City of New Haven grand list, unless upon prior approval by a majority of all holders of record of taxable interests in real property in the district. Upon revaluation of the property in the district, the figure "three-quarters of one percent (0.75%)" in the foregoing sentence shall be reduced or increased to that number yielding the equivalent amount of revenue on the revalued grand list. 
(c)  When the board shall, in a timely manner, recommend to the board of aldermen a levy upon the taxable interests in real property within the district, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 36-4 of this chapter and to subsection (e) of Section 7-339n of the Connecticut General Statutes (1958 Revision), it shall be the obligation of the board of aldermen to impose such levy as a municipal levy. Such levy shall be in addition to the regular municipal levy, and it shall be the obligation of the City of New Haven to collect such levy for the benefit of the district. The city shall transfer to the district only such funds as shall be collected. 
(d)  All moneys, including but not limited to levies or any income, proceeds or fees issuing from the provision of services by the district or other business conducted by the district received by the board or by the city on behalf of the district shall be paid into the general fund of the city where an account shall be maintained of such moneys for the benefit of the district. Any provisions of the city's general statutes, special acts or charter to the contrary notwithstanding, the treasurer of the city shall disburse such moneys in accordance with an annual budget adopted by the board. A quarterly financial report, based on the fiscal year July through June, of all district revenues and expenditures shall be submitted to the controller of the City of New Haven within thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter.

TECHNICAL ORDINANCES[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note The Technical Ordinances of the City of New Haven were published in 1962 as Volume III of the New Haven Code. In 2011 the city permitted the consolidation and transfer of the remaining Technical Ordinances to Volume II of the Code. Former and discontinued Volume III contained Title IV, Building Code; and Title V, Housing Code; associated indexes and Comparative Tables of ordinances amending these two titles. 
Former Title IV was divided into Parts IIII, Building, Plumbing and Electrical Codes; and Part IV, Flood Damage Prevention. Former Parts IIII were repealed by an ordinance adopted on July 6, 1981, as the city considered that the former Parts IIII were superseded by provisions enacted by the State of Connecticut. Part IV, Flood Damage Prevention, remained as the only active part of Title IV. 
Title V of the New Haven Code contains the housing code of the city. 
 
Title IV - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[2]

SECTION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1. - Statutory authorization. 
In Section 7-148(c)(7) of the General Statutes, the Legislature of the State of Connecticut delegates to local governmental units the responsibility of adopting regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the City of New Haven, Connecticut does ordain as follows: 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 1, 7-1-13 )  
1.2. - Findings of fact. 
1.2.1 The flood hazard areas of New Haven are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
1.2.2 These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 1, 7-1-13 )  
1.3. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.3.1 Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
1.3.2 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
1.3.3 Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
1.3.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
1.3.5 Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 1, 7-1-13 )  
1.4. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this ordinance are: 
1.4.1 To protect human life and health; 
1.4.2 To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
1.4.3 To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
1.4.4 To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
1.4.5 To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
1.4.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blighted areas; and 
1.4.7 To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area.

2.1.35 Start of construction, [for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (PL 97-348)], includes substantial improvement: The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
2.1.36 Structure: A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures. 
2.1.37 Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

2.1.38 Substantial improvement: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure taking place over a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure using the cost to approach value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local project required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimumare solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
2.1.39 Variance: A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. Such hardship shall be based on the unusual physical characteristics of the property in question which are not shared by adjacent parcels; hardship shall not be based on the structure, or on economic or personal hardships. 
2.1.40 Violation: Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
2.1.41 Water Surface Elevation: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New Haven County, Connecticut, July 8, 2013, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated December 17, 2010, July 8, 2013 (Panels 09009C0429J, 09009C0433J, 09009C0434J, 09009C0437J, 09009C0439J, 09009C0441J, 09009C0442J, 09009C0443J, 09009C0444J, 09009C0453J, 09009C0557J), and December 17, 2010 (Panels 09009C0426H, 09009C0427H, 09009C0428H, 09009C0436H, 09009C0461H, 09009C0556H), and other supporting data applicable to the City of New Haven, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this ordinance it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as zones A, AE, and VE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Zone VE is also identified as a coastal high hazard area. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. The FIS and FIRM are on file with the city/town clerk. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 3, 7-1-13 )  
3.3. - Establishment of the floodplain development permit. 
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities to be undertaken in a Special Flood Hazard Area. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 3, 7-1-13 )

( Ord. No. 1713, § 3, 7-1-13 )  
3.6. - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be: 1) considered as minimum requirements; 2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; 3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 3, 7-1-13 )  
3.7. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of New Haven or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

( Ord. No. 1713, § 4, 7-1-13 )  
SECTION 5. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
5.1 General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions shall apply: 
5.1.1 New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
5.1.2 New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
5.1.3 New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
5.1.4 Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within components during flooding conditions; 
5.1.5 New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
5.1.6 New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system into flood waters; 
5.1.7 On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; 
5.1.8 In any portion of a watercourse which is altered or relocated the flood carrying capacity shall be maintained; 
5.1.9 Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes (including "mobile" homes and recreational vehicles placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer), located within zone A or AE (including, but not limited to, manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park in which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood) to be placed or substantially improved shall be: 
5.1.9.1 Elevated so that the lowest floor is one foot above the base flood elevation; 
5.1.9.2 Placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors; 
5.1.9.3 Installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than 10 feet apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six feet above ground level. 
5.1.9.4 Adequate access and drainage should be provided. 
5.1.9.5 Recreational vehicles located within all areas of special flood hazard and coastal high hazard areas must either be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of a manufactured home. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
5.1.10 Compensatory storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality. 
5.1.11 Equal conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity. 
5.1.12 Above-ground storage tanks. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water. 
5.1.13 Portion of structure in flood zone. If any portion of a structure lies within the special flood hazard area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone. 
5.1.14 Structures in two flood zones. If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.) 
5.1.15 No structures entirely or partially over water. New construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 5, 7-1-13 ) 
 
5.2. - Standards for stream without established base flood elevations and/or flooding. 
The building inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data developed pursuant to section 6.4 of this ordinance, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Community's FIRM meet the standards of section 5.3. 
5.2.1 In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. 
5.2.2 Should data be required and/or provided, the City shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 5, 7-1-13 )  
5.3. - Specific standards. 
5.3.1 Special flood hazard areas (A and AE). In all areas of special flood hazard A and AE where base flood elevation data has been provided, the following provisions shall apply in addition to all general standards contained in section 5.1: 
5.3.1.1 Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one foot above to the base flood elevation. 
5.3.1.2 Non-residential construction. 
5.3.1.2.1 New construction or substantial improvement to any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure located in Zone A and AE shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
5.3.1.2.2 Non-residential structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed at least one foot above the base flood elevation in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the building inspector as set forth in 4.3.1.6. 
5.3.2 Fully enclosed areas below base flood elevation. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings that include fully-enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. An enclosed area below the base flood elevation that meets the design criteria specified below is not considered the lowest floor of the structure. The lowest floor must be elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. 
5.3.2.1 Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
5.3.2.1.1 Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
5.3.2.1.2 The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the slab elevation and set at or above the exterior ground elevation so as to permit free drainage away from the structuregrade; and 
5.3.2.1.3 Openings shall be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.3.2.2 Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation; and 
5.3.2.3 Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
5.3.3 Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.2 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that proposed encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
5.3.4 Coastal high hazard areas (Zone VE). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.2 are areas designated as coastal high hazard area VE. Since these areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters, including hurricane wave wash, the following provisions shall apply: 
5.3.4.1 All new construction or substantial improvement shall be located 25 feet landward of the reach of the mean high tide Connecticut Coastal Jurisdiction Line as defined in Connecticut General Statutes 22a-359 as amended by Public Act 12-101; 
5.3.4.2 All new construction or substantial improvement shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting structural horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water; 
5.3.4.3 All new construction or substantial improvement shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns; 
5.3.4.4 All pilings or columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support system shall be designed with wind and water loading values which equal or exceed the 100 year mean recurrence interval (one percent annual chance floods and winds); 
5.3.4.5 A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for construction and shall certify that the design, specifications and methods of construction are in accord with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions contained in sections 5.3.4.25.3.4.4 of this ordinance; 
5.3.4.6 There shall be no fill used as structural support. 
Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free from obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. 
The building inspector shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
5.3.4.6.1 Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; and 
5.3.4.6.2 Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
5.3.4.6.3 Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
5.3.4.7 There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage; 
5.3.4.8 Non-supporting breakaway walls, lattice work or mesh screening may be allowed below the base flood elevation provided it is not part of the structural support of the building and is designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which it is to be used and provided the following specific design specifications are met: 
5.3.4.8.1 Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not be less than 10 nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or 
5.3.4.8.2 If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval). 
5.3.4.9 If breakaway walls, lattice work or screening are utilized, the resulting enclosed space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
5.3.4.10 Prior to construction, plans for any structures that will have breakaway walls, lattice work or screening must be submitted to the building inspector for approval. 
5.3.4.11 Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with breakaway walls, lattice work or screening as provided for in sections 5.3.4.085.3.4.09. 
5.3.4.12 Manufactured homes located in VE zone. All manufactured homes (including "mobile" homes and recreational vehicles placed on site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer) located within VE zones (including, but not limited to, manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing maufactured home park in which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood) to be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of sustained substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member is at or above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home must also meet all the construction standards for VE zones as per section 5.3.4 coastal high hazard areas. All manufactured homes within VE zones shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. All manufactured homes within VE zones shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided. 
5.3.4.13 Recreational vehicles placed on sites within VE zones shall either be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the general standards of section 5.1 and the VE zone construction requirements of section 5.3.4, and the elevation and anchoring requirement of section 5.3.4.12. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 5, 7-1-13 )  
SECTION 6. - STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS 
In all special flood hazard areas the following requirements shall apply: 
6.1 All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
6.2 All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
6.3 All subdivision proposals shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
6.4 Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) which are five acres or fifty lots, whichever occurs first, and are located in Zone A. 
( Ord. No. 1713, § 6, 7-1-13 )

For the purpose of making such inspections, the enforcing officer is hereby authorized to enter, examine, and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units, and premises. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, and rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the enforcing officer free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection, examination and survey. Each occupant of a dwelling or dwelling unit shall give the owner thereof, or his agent or employee, access to any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit, or its premises, at all reasonable times, for the purpose of making such repairs and/or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this title or any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this title.

Note Formerly, ¶ 204.  
Par. 202. - Order for the abatement of nuisance. 
(a)  Whenever the enforcing officer shall issue an order alleging the existence of a nuisance as defined in paragraph 100(p) and such order is not complied with, or not so far complied with as the enforcing officer may regard as reasonable, within the time therein designated, the order may be executed in whole or in part by the enforcing officer, his agents or contractors; or, as an alternative, if a tenement house is involved, the enforcing officer may pursue his remedies under the receivership provisions of this title. No order shall be executed or receivership initiated unless all mortgagees and lienors of record of the property where a nuisance exists shall have been served with a copy of the order at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to taking such action. If any such mortgagee or lienor cannot with due diligence be served personally within the City of New Haven, service may be had on such person by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place on the property where the nuisance exists, and by sending a copy thereof by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee or lienor at the address set forth in the recorded mortgage or lien. 
(b)  The expenses and disbursements incurred by the enforcing officer in carrying out such orders shall initially be paid for from the housing repair fund hereinafter described in subparagraph (h) or any other appropriation or fund for such purpose. 
(c)  The city shall have a lien for such expenses as are incurred in the execution of an order, which lien shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances, except taxes and assessments, recorded previously to the existence of such lien. 
(d)  No such lien shall be valid for any purpose until the enforcing officer shall file with the city clerk, for recordation with deeds of land, a certificate subscribed and sworn to by the enforcing officer describing the premises, the owner of the premises, the amount claimed as a lien thereon, and the date of commencement of the activities undertaken in executing the order, and stating that the amount is justly due and that the expense has been incurred in pursuance of the order of the enforcing officer, giving the date of the order. Such certificate shall be filed at any time during the progress of the work required by such order or within four (4) months after the completion of the contract, or the final performance of the work, or the final furnishing of the materials, dating from the last item of work performed or materials furnished. 
(e)  Unless, within six (6) months after actual notice of such filing, proceedings to discharge such lien are taken by the party against whom or whose premises a lien is claimed, the filing shall, as to all persons having such actual notice, become conclusive evidence that the amount claimed in the notice of lien with interest is due and is a just lien upon the premises. 
(f)  When the enforcing officer shall have executed any order so far as it may require, the enforcing officer shall file among his records such order and an affidavit stating with fairness and accuracy the items of expense in general terms and the date of execution of such order. 
(g)  The expenses of executing an order, until the same are paid or discharged, shall be a lien and charge upon rent and compensation due or then maturing from any tenant or occupant of the dwelling and premises or part thereof to which any such order relates, or in respect of which any such expenses were incurred. Recovery or repayment of such expenses as are incurred in executing an order may be obtained by the enforcing officer by collecting rents directly from the tenants of the dwelling involved, or by a suit against the owner of the dwelling instituted and maintained in the name of the City of New Haven, or both. Any such recovery or repayment shall be deposited in the housing repair fund to be used for the purpose of the fund. 
(h)  A fund to be known as the housing repair fund is hereby created and established. Into such fund shall be deposited such monies as shall be appropriated or allotted by the board of aldermen and the board of finance or shall be realized from the sale of bonds issued pursuant to chapter 109 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, as amended, for that purpose, or such amounts as may from time to time be received as grants or grant-in-aid under any state or federal program, or such other monies as shall otherwise be made available to the fund.

The filing of such petition shall not automatically stay operation of the order. For good cause shown, the party filing the petition, within the time allowed for such filing, may make written request of the enforcing officer for a stay of operation of the order pending the hearing by the board of code appeals. Such request shall be ruled on by a committee comprised of the chairman of the board of code involved, and at least one (1) other member of the board of code appeals.

(2)  That the effect of the application of the provisions would be arbitrary in the specific case; 
(3)  That an extension would not constitute an appropriate remedy for these practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships and this arbitrary effect; and

PREFACE 
    The 1995 Zoning Ordinance of the City of New Haven was originally published by the city as a separate reprint designated as Volume III, Title VI of the Code of the City of New Haven. Subsequently the city has updated the Zoning Ordinance on an annual basis with indexing provided by Municipal Code Corporation. 
    The Zoning Ordinance was republished in its entirety by Municipal Code Corporation in 2003. The Zoning Ordinance will be updated by supplements published by Municipal Code Corporation. Each replacement supplement will carry a supplement number, starting with No. 1, at the bottom left of the page. 
    The Zoning Ordinance is divided into articles which are then divided into sections. The pages of this volume are numbered with a two-part system with the article number as a prefix and a sequential numeral as the section part. The Code Comparative Table and the Index at the end of the volume carry their own prefix designations. 
    The republication of this volume was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

Sections 3-10. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. RESIDENCE DISTRICTS: DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Section 11. - RS-1 Districts: Special Single-Family. 
    Description and purpose. These districts exist for the protection of certain fully developed single-family areas of relatively small total size but of unique and irreplaceable value to the community as a whole. The specific purpose of these districts is to stabilize and preserve the low-density residential character of these areas to the maximum possible extent. To this end the use of land and buildings within these areas is limited primarily to single-family homes. The particular character, size and surroundings of these areas create little need for the location within their boundaries of further such non-residential uses as generally support a low-density residential area, and the location of any further such uses within these areas would undesirably limit or diminish the number of homes in them. It is hereby found and declared that these regulations are necessary for the protection of these areas and that their protection is essential to the maintenance of a balanced community of sound residential areas of diverse types. 
All RS-2 Districts are subject to the general provisions for residence districts set forth in Article IV as well as to all other provisions of this ordinance. 
    Uses permitted. In an RS-1 District, a building or other structure may be erected, altered, arranged, designed or used, and a lot or structure may be used for any of the following purposes and no other: 
(a)  Residentialusesas follows. The General Provisions for Residence Districts in Article IV shall also apply. 
(1)  Single-family detached dwellings. There shall be only one principal building on a lot. Building requirements: 
a.  Minimum lot area: 7,500 sq. ft. 
b.  Minimum average lot width: 60 ft., except for nonconforming lots under subsection 67(e). 
c.  Maximum building coverage: Total coverage of principal and accessory buildings not to exceed 30% of lot area. 
d.  Maximum building height: Such height shall not exceed either three stories or an average height of 35 feet. 
Provided that, no point on a side or rear building wall shall be so located that it is closer to a side or rear lot line than one foot for each two feet that such point is above the average finished lot grade along such side or rear building wall. 
e.  Minimum yards: 
Front -25 ft., except that where 75% or more of the entire street frontage (in feet) on the same side of the same street between the nearest two intersecting streets has been developed with buildings with front yards smaller than 25 feet, the required front yard shall be the same as the yard presently followed by existing buildings along the greatest quantity of street frontage (in feet). 
Rear -25 ft. 
Side -One at least eight ft. and the other at least twelve ft.; in the case of a corner lot, at least eight ft. for the one side yard. 
f.  Minimum parking: One parking space for the first bedroom, and one-half parking space for each additional bedroom, rounded to the next higher number if a fraction. All parking spaces shall be located on the same lot, and shall conform to section 29 and the remainder of the General Provisions for Residence Districts in Article IV. 
g.  Maximum impervious surface coverage: Total coverage of building(s) and paved area (parking and walkways) shall not exceed 70% of the lot area. 
(2)  Residential accessory buildings, structures and uses, as regulated by paragraph (1) above and by the General Provisions for Residence Districts. 
(3)  Conversion of an existing building to a greater number of dwelling units by variance as follows: 
Supplemental statement of purpose: Preservation of the unique residential character of RS-1 District areas requires that variances for uses not allowed in these districts be granted only where absolutely necessary and only for the least possible departure from the provisions of these districts. Any other provision of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, no variance shall be granted from the use regulations of these districts except for conversion of existing buildings to a greater number of dwelling units in accordance with the standards of this section. These standards are hereby found and declared to be minimum standards for stabilizing and preserving the character of RS-1 District areas and their value to the community as a whole, and any variance of the use regulations of these districts other than in accordance with these standards is hereby declared to violate the spirit of this ordinance and the general purpose and intent of these regulations. 
A variance for conversion of an existing building to a greater number of dwelling units may be granted only in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  It must be clearly demonstrated that continued use of the building with its existing number of dwelling units would create such hardship as would practically destroy or greatly decrease its value, provided that: 
1.  The evidence offered to demonstrate such hardship shall not relate to such deterioration of the building as would suggest its removal and reuse of the land for single-family detached dwellings in accordance with the provisions of these districts; and 
2.  Before granting a variance for conversion of a principal building, the Board shall find that such hardship cannot be sufficiently mitigated by subdivision of the lot for one or more additional lots conforming to the standards of these districts for single-family detached dwellings or by conversion of an existing accessory building to a single-family detached dwelling where such subdivision or such conversion would have a lesser impact upon the surrounding area than would conversion of the principal building to a greater number of dwelling units in accordance with the standards of this paragraph (3). 
b.  The building shall have been erected more than 30 years before conversion, and any increase of its gross floor area beyond 20% during the ten years immediately preceding conversion shall not be deemed to contribute to hardship under subparagraph 11(a)(3)a. or be considered in determining the maximum number of allowable dwelling units under subparagraph 11(a)(3)c. of this paragraph 11(a)(3). 
c.  Any variance granted for conversion of a building to a greater number of dwelling units shall be for the minimum number of dwelling units necessary to mitigate the hardship and in no case for more dwelling units than are allowable under the requirement that the building and lot in question contain an average of: 
1,500 sq. ft. of gross floor area; 
7,500 sq. ft. of lot area; and 
60 ft. of average lot width 
per dwelling unit after conversion. (In the case of a corner lot, the width of the lot for purposes of this subparagraph 11.A.3.c shall be deemed to be the average of its two street frontages.) 
d.  Off-street parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot as the building being converted equal to the number of dwelling units on the lot after conversion. 
e.  Stairways leading to the second or any higher floor shall be located within the walls of the building wherever practicable, and stairways and fire escapes shall otherwise be located on the rear wall in preference to either side wall and in no case on a front wall or side wall facing a street. 
f.  Except for the provision of stairways and fire escapes in accordance with the preceding subparagraph, there shall be no major structural change in the exterior of the building in connection with the conversion, and after conversion the building shall retain substantially the appearance it had before such conversion. 
(b)  Non-residential uses as follows: The standards in paragraph 11(a)(1) above relating to minimum lot area, minimum average lot width, building coverage, minimum building height, and minimum yards shall apply to non-residential uses except as indicated below. 
Accessory uses customarily incidental to the following uses are permitted in connection with such uses. 
Parking spaces required by this ordinance for the following uses may be located (by special exception under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance) on a separate lot in any district in which the principal use is permitted, provided the standards of section 29 are met. 
Section 29 relating to parking and all other pertinent sections of the general provisions for residence districts in Article IV shall apply to all such uses. 
(1)  As of right: 
a.  Parks and other facilities for passive recreation, and public playgrounds. 
b.  Reservoirs, dams, public utility substations and pumping stations, telephone exchanges, police stations, fire stations and post offices, with no industrial activities or outside storage. 
c.  Family daycare home. 
(2)  Where permitted by special exception under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance: 
a.  Temporary uses and structures such as rental offices, booths for charitable purposes and parking for special events, with a time limit of not more than six (6) months. 
b.  Peripheral expansion of existing institutions as follows: 
Any of the following uses of land and/or buildings: 
1.  Religious institutions; 
2.  Public and private elementary and secondary schools meeting all requirements of the compulsory education laws of the State of Connecticut; 
3.  Private and public colleges and universities (excluding trade and/or business schools); and 
4.  Pre-school (nursery and day care center) programs when provided as part of the broader programs of such religious and educational institutions; and noise and all other possible disturbance aspects connected with the operation of such uses shall be enclosed, screened, or otherwise controlled to the extent that the operation of any such use shall not unduly interfere with the use and enjoyment of properties and streets in the surrounding area. 
c.  When in existence on the effective date of the RS-1 District provisions, items in subsection 11.(b)(2)b. may be further developed and expanded as follows: 
1.  Property owned by such an institution in an area designated as an RS-1 District on the effective date of such designation may be used and further developed by the institution owning it for its own religious or educational purposes, as of right, regardless of any other provision of this section 11. By special exception, such property may be used and developed by another religious or educational institution as described above, provided that such other institution shall not be allowed to expanded under clauses 2. and 3. below. 
2.  Such an institution either (1) owning property in the RS-1 part of a block designated in whole or in part as an RS-1 District on the effective date of such designation, or (2) owning property in the non-RS-1 part of a block designated in part as an RS-1 District and acquired by the institution in accordance with the zoning regulations applicable to that non-RS-1 part of the block, may expand peripherally into and within the RS-1 part of that block by acquisition and use for its religious or educational purposes of any property that adjoins property owned by it under 11(b)(1) or 11(b)(2) above or acquired in accordance with this peripheral expansion provision. 
3.  Such an institution may expand across a street in or into an RS-1 District as follows: once 50% of the land area in the block from which it is expanding (herein called the base block), as well as 75% of the linear frontage of the base block that abuts a particular adjoining block, is used for religious or educational purposes by one or more such institutions, then any one of such institutions owning and using for its religious or educational purposes 100,000 square feet of land in the base block and 100 feet of its linear frontage abutting the adjoining block may expand across the street into said adjoining block once it acquires and uses for its religious or educational purposes therein (1) as much of the linear frontage of said adjoining block that abuts upon the base block as necessary, when added to any of that frontage already being used by one or more such institutions for religious or educational purposes, to constitute 75% of that frontage, plus (2) as much additional and adjoining property in said adjoining block, when added to the frontage of the property acquired by the expanding institution, to constitute 100,000 square feet of land. 
4.  Any property further developed or acquired by a religious or educational institution under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (c) may be used for religious or educational purposes only if the off-street parking requirements for such institution stated in the district regulations for RS-2 Districts are met. 
5.  Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent the use of property anywhere within an RS-1 District by a religious or educational institution as a single-family detached dwelling within the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section; provided, however, that property so used shall not later be used for other purposes nor be used as a basis for expansion by that institution under clause 11(b)(2).c.2 of this subparagraph 11(b)(2)c.

Section 12. - RS-2 Districts: General Single-Family. 
    Description and purpose. These districts exist for the protection of areas, most of them large in size, that have been and are being developed predominantly for single-family dwellings. Accordingly, the use of land and buildings within such areas is limited to single-family detached dwellings, and to such non-residential uses as generally support and harmonize with a low-density residential area. The non-residential uses permitted in RS-2 Districts, subject to adequate conditions and safeguards, are hereby found and declared to be the only appropriate such uses for such areas. It is hereby found and declared, further, that these regulations are necessary to the protection of these areas and that their protection is essential to the maintenance of a balanced community of sound residential areas of diverse types. 
All RS-2 Districts are subject to the general provisions for residence districts set forth in Article IV as well as to all other provisions of this ordinance. 
    Uses permitted. In an RS-2 District a building or other structure may be erected, altered, arranged, designed or used, and a lot or structure may be used for any of the following purposes and no other:

b.  Minimum average lot width: 60 ft., except for nonconforming lots under subsection 67(e). 
c.  Maximum building coverage: Total coverage of principal and accessory buildings not to exceed 30% of lot area. 
d.  Maximumbuildingheight: Such height shall not exceed either three stories or an average height of 35 feet. 
Provided that no point on a side or rear building wall shall be so located that it is closer to a side or rear lot line than one foot for each two feet that such point is above the average finished lot grade along such side or rear building wall. 
e.  Minimum yards: 
Front -25 ft., except that where 75 percent or more of the entire street frontage (in feet) on the same side of the same street between the nearest two intersecting streets has been developed with buildings with front yards smaller than 25 feet, the required front yard shall be the same as the yard presently followed by existing buildings along the greatest quantity of street frontage (in feet). 
Rear -25 ft. 
Side -one at least eight ft. and the other at least 12 ft.; in the case of a corner lot, at least eight ft. for the one side yard. 
f.  Minimum parking: One parking space for the first bedroom, and one-half parking space for each additional bedroom, rounded to the next higher number if a fraction. All parking spaces shall be located on the same lot and shall conform to section 29 and the remainder of the General Provisions for Residence Districts in Article IV. 
g.  Maximum impervious surface coverage: Total coverage of building(s) and paved area (parking and walkways) shall not exceed 70 percent of the lot area. 
(2)  Residential accessorybuildings,structuresanduses,as regulated by paragraph 1 above and by the General Provisions for Residence Districts. 
(3)  Conversion of an existingbuildingto a greater number ofdwelling unitsby a variance as follows: 
Any other provisions of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, no variance shall be granted from the use regulations of these districts for conversion of an existing building to a greater number of dwelling units except in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  It must be clearly demonstrated that continued use of the building with its existing number of dwelling units would create such hardship as would practically destroy or greatly decrease its value, provided that: 
1.  The evidence offered to demonstrate such hardship shall not relate to such deterioration of the building as would suggest its removal and reuse of the land for single-family detached dwellings in accordance with the provisions of these districts; and, 
2.  Before granting a variance for conversion of a principal building , the Board shall find that such hardship cannot be sufficiently mitigated by subdivision of the lot for one or more additional lots conforming to the standards of these districts for single-family detached dwellings or by conversion of an existing accessory building to a single-family detached dwelling where such subdivision or such conversion would have a lesser impact upon the surrounding area than would conversion of the principal building to a greater number of dwelling units in accordance with the standards of this paragraph (3). 
b.  The building shall have been erected more than 30 years before conversion, and any increase of its gross floor area beyond 20% during the ten years immediately preceding conversion shall not be deemed to contribute to hardship under subparagraph a of this paragraph (3).

Section 15. - RH-1 Districts: Special high density. 
    Description and purpose. These districts exist for the protection of certain multi-family areas of relatively small total size but of unique and irreplaceable value to the community as a whole. The specific purpose of these districts is to stabilize and preserve the existing residential character of these areas to the maximum possible extent. To this end, the use of land and buildings within these areas is limited primarily to relatively high density residential uses, as the particular character, size and surroundings of these areas create little need for the location within their boundaries of further other such non-residential uses as generally support a residential area. Moreover, these areas are found especially along major streets traversing large residential sections of the city, and the outward movement of office or other commercial uses along these streets would constitute a serious threat to the residential quality of the areas to either side of them. Encroachment of office or other commercial uses along these streets would violate the spirit of this ordinance and its general purpose and intent and, any other provision of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, no variance shall be granted for such uses in these districts. It is hereby found and declared that these regulations are necessary to the protection of these areas and that their protection is essential to the maintenance of a balanced community of sound residential areas of diverse types. 
All RH-1 Districts are subject to the General Provisions for Residence Districts set forth in Article IV as well as to all provisions of this ordinance. 
    Uses permitted. In an RH-1 District a building or other structure may be erected, altered, arranged, designed or used, and a lot or structure may be used for any of the following purposes and no other: 
(a)  Residentialusesas follows. The General Provisions for Residence Districts in Article IV shall also apply. 
(1)  Dwellings-single-family, two-family and multi-family. 
Building requirements: 
a.  Minimumlot area: 7,500 sq. ft. 
b.  Minimum average lot width: 60 ft., except for nonconforming lots under subsection 67(e). 
c.  Maximum building coverage for principal building or principal buildings : 25% of lot area. 
d.  Maximum building height: No direct limit. 
Provided that no point on a side or rear building wall shall be so located that it is closer to a side or rear lot line than one foot for each two feet that such point is above the average finished lot grade along such side or rear building wall. 
e.  Minimum yards: 
Front -25 ft., except that where 75% or more of the entire street frontage (in feet) on the same side of the same street between the nearest two intersecting streets has been developed with buildings with front yards smaller than 25 feet, the required front yard shall be the same as the yard presently followed by existing buildings along the greatest quantity of street frontage (in feet). Provided that, the front yard shall in any case be increased if necessary to maintain a ratio of one foot between the front building wall and the center line of the street to two feet of average height measured along the front building wall, except as provided in subsection 30(b). 
Rear -25 ft. 
Side -10 ft. for each side yard. 
f.  Maximum gross floor area: No such building or buildings shall have a gross floor area greater than 0.5 times the lot area; except that this floor area may be increased by 0.1 times the lot area (up to a maximum of 1.7 times the lot area ) for each 1% of lot area by which the building coverage of the principal building or buildings is reduced below the maximum of 25% of lot area set by subparagraph (c) above. The maximum floor area ratio allowable at each percent of building coverage under this formula is as follows: 
Building 
Coverage 
in Percent Floor Area Ratio 25 0.5 24 0.6 23 0.7 22 0.8 21 0.9 20 1.0 19 1.1 18 1.2 17 1.3 16 1.4 15 1.5 14 1.6 13 or less 1.7  
In any case of a building existing on the effective date of the application of these regulations thereto, which building then becomes nonconforming in building coverage and/or floor area ratio under the above formula, there may be located therein by conversion no more than an average of one dwelling unit per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area in the building on said effective date. 
Where a lot contains more than one principal building in the same ownership, all such buildings shall be considered together in determining the floor area ratio. 
g.  Minimum usable open space : 125 square feet per dwelling unit , except 100 square feet in the case of elderly housing units by special exception under subparagraph 63.(d) of this ordinance, provided that in the event that a minimum of 50 square feet of private usable open space in the form of balconies, patios, decks, porches or private courts that are attached or are located immediately adjacent to the dwelling unit that they serve is provided, then the balance of the usable open space required under this subsection for such dwelling unit shall be reduced by one-quarter. All usable open space shall be subject to the following minimum standards in addition to others which may be applicable. 
1.  Common usable open space shall be so located and designed as to emphasize convenience of tenant access and ease of use. 
2.  All common grade level usable open space shall be landscaped and otherwise developed to maximize recreational utility. Landscape improvements shall include trees, shrubs, ground cover and, wherever possible, the retention of existing landscape features.

(c)  No parking space shall be located within any required front yard , except that: parking spaces (whether enclosed or not) may be permitted to be located within a required front yard by special exception under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance upon finding, among other things, that such parking spaces are necessary to the use with which they are connected, that they cannot be practically located elsewhere on the lot, that their location within a required front yard will not depreciate property values or cause vehicular or pedestrian traffic hazards or substantially decrease the open aspect of the street, and that such parking spaces are properly screened and otherwise arranged in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
A parking space or bicycle space may be located within a required side yard or rear yard , provided that no such parking space or bicycle space shall extend within two feet of any side of any side lot line or rear lot line ; but a parking space or bicycle space within an accessory building shall follow the requirements of section 25 as to location within required side and rear yards . 
(d)  A site shall provide two bicycle spaces for the first ten required or proposed parking spaces and one additional bicycle space for each additional ten required or proposed motor vehicle parking spaces or fraction thereof. 
In any case of a use in a residence district for which ten or more motor vehicle parking spaces are required one bicycle parking space may be substituted for one motor vehicle parking space per each ten required motor vehicle parking spaces or fraction thereof. 
(e)  Bicycle parking spaces shall comply with designs approved by the City of New Haven Department of Transportation, Traffic and Parking and at a minimum must provide a bicycle rack that permits the locking of a bicycle frame and one wheel while supporting the bicycle in a stable position that will not damage the bicycle or its components or interfere with pedestrian access to the sidewalk and ingress and egress to buildings or facilities.

This requirement shall not apply to parking spaces located on a lot owned by a public housing authority. 
(g)  All artificial lighting used to illuminate any parking space or spaces shall be so arranged that all direct rays from such lighting fall entirely within such parking space or spaces and shall comply with the requirements of Section 60.1 of these regulations regarding exterior lighting. 
(h)  No sales or servicing or dead storage of automobiles or automotive equipment shall be carried on in any parking space . 
(i)  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to lessen the requirements of this ordinance as to the number of parking spaces required and/or increase the maximum allowable walking distance to such parking spaces, but only upon a finding that either particular circumstance or mitigative measures qualify such action. Particular circumstance may include, but not be limited to availability of public parking, proximity to public transit or significant levels of pedestrian access. Mitigative measures may include, but not be limited to van and/or car pooling, public parking validation programs, flexible work schedules or other transportation demand management measures. All deviations from normal requirements by means of this paragraph shall be considered as special exceptions under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance. In the case of any religious or educational institution or any hospital, which has an overall parking plan for all of its facilities which has been approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the limit of 300 feet walking distance shall not apply. Amendments to a parking plan that covers an area which include a planned development must be submitted for approval per section 65 of this ordinance. All deviations from normal requirements by means of this subsection 29(i) shall be considered special exceptions under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance, and the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose time limits where it finds that the continued adequacy of such other parking standards cannot be fairly predicted. 
(j)  Where it is proposed that two or more uses for which a parking space or spaces are required make joint use of the same parking space or spaces, such joint use shall not be permitted unless: 
(1)  A special exception is granted under the provisions of subsection 63(d), upon a finding, among other things, that the proposed joint use of parking will meet the requirements of this ordinance for the two or more uses involved at the time when such uses are in operation. 
(k)  Two parking spaces may be subtracted from the quantity of parking spaces required for a use or a structure for each carsharing parking space provided in a parking lot or structure containing 50 or fewer parking spaces serving such use or structure, provided, however, that in no event shall the number of parking spaces provided for a use or a structure (excluding carsharing parking spaces ) be reduced by more than five percent of the parking spaces required for such use or structure. Five parking spaces may be subtracted from the quantity of parking spaces required for a use or a structure for each carsharing parking space provided in such parking lot or structure containing in excess of 50 parking spaces, provided, however, that in no event shall the number of parking spaces provided for a use or a structure (excluding carsharing parking spaces ) be reduced by more than ten percent of the parking spaces required for such use or structure. Fifty percent of carsharing parking spaces at the same location may be compact parking spaces. 
(l)  Once any required parking space has been established within the provisions of this section 29, whether on the same lot as the structure or use to which it is assigned or on a separate lot, such parking space shall not be discontinued if the result would be a reduction below the amount of parking required by this ordinance. Any such discontinuation of a parking space shall constitute a violation of this ordinance, and any existing building permit or certificate of occupancy that could not have been issued without the assignment of such parking space to the structure or use for which it was issued shall become null and void.

A maximum of 15 indoor and outdoor seats is permitted and no additional parking shall be required for seasonal outdoor seating. The City Plan Commission may adopt administrative regulations regarding the placement, spacing and storage of tables and chairs and other operational limits as it deems necessary. Special consideration shall be given to the placement, spacing and storage of tables and chairs and other operational limits on outdoor seating that is proposed to extend into the public right-of-way. 
(c)  Existing uses of the above types may continue, but: 
(1)  The rules of subparagraph 67(c)(6).b of this ordinance shall determine whether any use has been abandoned, and any such use that has been abandoned shall not be reestablished except as a new use under subsection (d) below. 
(2)  Conversion from one of the above permitted uses to another such use shall be considered the establishment of a new use under subsection (d) below. 
(3)  No alteration of a structure or of the remainder of the premises shall be made which creates or increases any nonconformity under the provisions of this ordinance. 
(4)  Any expansion of the amount of floor area and/or lot area occupied by the use or by functions incidental to it (such as parking and loading) shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (d) below. 
(d)  New uses of the above types may be established, and existing uses expanded, only by special exception under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance, subject to the following standards in addition to others which may be applicable: 
(1)  There must be a finding by the City Plan Commission that space for such a use is not available in nearby areas which are zoned for business, and that such new use or expansion of an existing use is necessary to serve the immediate neighborhood adequately with convenience goods or services, giving due consideration, among other things, to the character of the neighborhood, the density of development, the shopping habits of neighborhood residents, and the availability of public and private transportation. The clustering of two or more uses of diverse types, rather than scattering of such uses , shall generally be regarded as an advantage, but the existence nearby of a use of the same type as one which is proposed shall require a more extensive showing of necessity for the proposed use . As a general rule, clustering of uses shall not exceed 10,000 square feet of net floor area for all uses in a cluster. 
(2)  The net floor area used for sales or other business purposes in any establishment (excluding space used for storage and similar purposes) shall not exceed 1,500 square feet.

ARTICLE V. BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 

Section 41. - Description and purpose of business and industrial districts. 
    The Business and Industrial districts contained in this zoning ordinance are established to provide for the most rational and orderly separation of land uses according to their function in the city, and to fulfill the other purposes of zoning. The regulations herein adopted are hereby found and declared to be appropriate to New Haven and in accordance with a comprehensive plan designed for the continued vitality and development of the city. The following statements of description and purpose outline the main functions of these districts in the zoning plan. 
    Business A Districts-General Business. These districts serve several functions. They provide central concentrations of convenience goods and services for one or more neighborhoods, supplemented by more scattered stores for such goods and services within the neighborhoods provided for under a special provision of the regulations for residence districts. They provide comparison shopper's goods, specialty goods, amusements and numerous services for less than a citywide market. And they also provide locations for small businessmen with a city-wide market who cannot operate in the downtown area. The predominant purpose of all these functions is retail trade. 
    Business A-1 Districts-Neighborhood Center Mixed Use. These districts serve as the commercial heart of their neighborhood, are of modest scale and pedestrian orientation, and seek to preserve and restore the historic architecture and urban pattern of the city. The emphasis is on neighborhood goods and services rather than comparison shopping , with a preference for smaller pedestrian-oriented, storefront retail, dinning, and other appropriate uses. They are intended as mixed-use districts with a mixture of ground floor retail, small offices, and upper story residential dwellings. Buildings are oriented to the street, parking requirements are reduced and parking maximums established to encourage walkability and community over automotive-related sprawl. New development is required by form requirements and design guidelines to conform to the neighborhood context, to improve the retail character of the street as a neighborhood center, and to promote the health, safety and well being of residents by reducing sources of public nuisance and encouraging physical activity and community interaction and involvement. 
    Business A-2 Districts-Village Center Mixed Use. These districts serve distinct mixed-use communities woven into the larger tapestry of New Haven. Parking is reduced and density is increased to encourage development of neglected or vacant buildings into pedestrian-oriented storefront retail, dining, and other appropriate uses. Upper story residential dwellings are encouraged along commercial strips and ground floor residential dwellings are encouraged on side streets. Height limits are maintained to prevent over-development, but the district otherwise does not restrict property owners' ability to employ a range of architectural styles. 
    Business B Districts-Automotive Sales. These districts follow a deliberate policy which recognizes the importance of automotive sales to the city and further recognizes that such sales can perform their function in the best and most integrated manner by concentration in certain areas of the city. Establishments for the sale of new vehicles, and for the sale of large numbers of used vehicles, are concentrated in these areas, from which non-related uses are excluded in order to assure the maximum development of automobile sales and related uses. 
    Business C Districts-Marine. These districts exist to separate out certain waterfront areas which have-and are encouraged to be-a mix of water-dependent public access, recreational boating, public and private marinas, commercial and recreational fishing, community based, water related activities and waterfront residential environments. 
    Business D District-Central Business. This district comprises the main downtown section of the city, known in planning terms as the Central Business District (CBD). Here are concentrated activities that have primarily a citywide and regional function: large stores offering comparison shopper's goods, specialty stores, business services, banks, offices, theaters, hotels and government buildings. Land use is intensive and this intensity of uses is one of the main determinants of the vitality of the Central Business District. It is the purpose of these regulations to encourage such intensity of use and to exclude activities which have a negative effect upon the proper functioning of the downtown area. 
    Business D-1 Districts-Central Business/Residential. These districts include appropriate downtown areas which have concentrations of historic structures suitable for both residential and commercial use. This district concentrates residential uses at high density mixed with activities that have both a city-wide and district-wide function: small stores offering comparison shopper's goods, specialty stores, business services, offices and entertainment uses. The use of land is intensive, but respects the historic character of existing historic structures. It is the purpose of these regulations to encourage preservation of existing historic structures, conversion of existing structures to residential use, high intensity of use, and to exclude activities that have a negative effect upon the proper functioning of National Register Historic Districts or of the larger downtown. 
    Business D-2 Districts-Central Business/Medical. This district Includes appropriate areas in and around the city's hospitals and medical centers having high density medical institutional uses including hospitals, clinical, laboratory or bioscience research space, patient care medical offices, and supportive accessory uses, with pedestrian-friendly ground floor retail uses in some buildings. The district allows intensive use of land for such uses subject to site plan approval to further the city's policy of encouraging dense development of institutional uses within concentrated areas in and around the Central Business District while maintaining a human-scale streetscape. It is the purpose of these regulations to allow such intensity of hospital, medical, research and medical institutional uses in combination with street-level retail uses encouraging pedestrian connections between the medical areas and adjacent neighborhoods and business districts, and to exclude uses which are incompatible with or would have a negative effect upon the functioning of hospital, medical and research and medical institutional uses. 
    Business D-3 Districts-Central Business/Mixed-Use. These districts in the urban core are reserved for intensive development, including multi-story and mid and high rise buildings. They provide for mixed uses, including hospital outpatient clinics, other medical clinics, biotechnology research centers, high and medium density residences, offices, and commercial uses, including retail shops and restaurants. These districts also connect the city's central business and medical and educational districts with each other and with the city's transportation center at Union Station. The Central Business/Mixed Use districts are pedestrian, bicycle and transit friendly. Uses on the ground floors of nonresidential and mixed use buildings that face public rights-of-way in these districts should include retail and active uses that are in part or in whole transparent from sidewalks and streets. 
    Business E Districts-Wholesale and Distribution. These districts furnish goods and services that are mainly used in support of retail trade for the city and the region. The principal activities located here are wholesaling, warehousing, transportation, heavy business services, distribution, and some incidental processing. Such functions are generally located in such a position that they can support the Central Business Districts and at the same time concentrate their heavy traffic requirements near the main arteries for movement of goods and services. 
    Industry L Districts-Light Industry. These districts, in common with other business and industrial districts, are regulated by a set of performance standards prescribing upper limits for nuisance factors such as noise and smoke. Industries are permitted which keep within those limits, as well as business uses which generally support and are integrated with other uses in such districts. Further development of residences is prohibited from these districts and also from Industry H and Business E Districts, in order to conserve the supply of heavy commercial and industrial land and to prevent residences from being established under strongly adverse conditions. Industry L Districts are characterized in general by less intensive development and fewer outdoor uses than Industry H Districts. 
    Industry M Districts-Light Industry/Marine. These districts are regulated by a series of land use controls and performance measures in areas of the city with both waterfront and industrial characteristics with limited freight transportation connections and/or located in close proximity to a residential neighborhood. Uses allowed within the district are both marine and light industrial in nature. 
    Industry H Districts-Heavy Industry. These districts have many regulations similar to those in Industry L Districts. They are apt. however, to be more intensively developed and to contain older and heavier industries. These districts also contain vacant industrial land with a high potential for development. Fewer business uses are contained in these districts than in Industry L Districts. Less restriction is placed upon outdoor uses, although such uses must conform to the performance standards which apply to other industries. Certain uses, with established functions in the economy but having a well-known nuisance potential, are permitted only in Industry H Districts and there only by special exception. 
(Ord. No. 1410, § 1, 3-20-06; Ord. No. 1412 (Rev. Sched. A, § 3), 5-1-06; Ord. No. 1614, § 1, 3-1-10; Ord. No. 1685, Sched. D, 8-6-12; Ord. No. 1842, Sched. B, 6-4-18) 
Section 42. - Use regulations for business and industrial districts. 
    The following table describes the uses permitted in each business or industrial district. 
    In any case where a use is not specifically referred to by the following table, its status under this section shall be determined by the zoning enforcement officer, by reference to a clearly analogous use or uses that are specifically referred to by the table. When the status of a use has been so determined by the zoning enforcement officer, such determination shall thereafter have general applicability to all uses of the same type. For uses that are not specified and are not clearly analogous to uses specifically referred to in the following table, an application must be made either for an amendment to the zoning ordinance or for a use variance with the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
    Accessory uses customarily incidental to uses in the table are permitted in connection with such uses. Such accessory uses may include residences of caretakers and other such persons who must live in the area for the convenience of business or industry, and their dependents. 
    Matters closely related to use are regulated by: 
(1)  Bulk and yards ..... § 43 and § 47 
(2)  Signs ..... § 44 
(3)  Parking and loading ..... § 45

Section 42.1. - Restriction on sale of alcoholic liquor. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
    ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR: The term shall have the same definition as that term has in the Liquor Control Act of the State of Connecticut, as said Act may be amended from time to time. Said definition at present appears in Section 30-1(3) of the General Statutes of Connecticut. The definition of alcoholic liquor shall in any event always include alcohol, beer, spirits, and wine. 
    PACKAGE PERMIT: The term shall include a package store permit, a package store beer permit, a grocery store beer permit, a druggist liquor permit, or any combination of same, as issued or to be issued from time to time by the State Department of Liquor Control. For the purposes of clarity, the permits referenced herein are at present defined and found in Sections 30-20(a), (b) and 30-36, respectively, of the Connecticut General Statutes. In addition, the term package permit shall include any other permit which shall from time to time be authorized by the Connecticut General Statutes and issued by the State Department of Liquor Control, which permit shall be for the purpose of permitting the sale of any type of alcoholic liquor in sealed containers at retail for consumption off the premises. 
(b)  Measurement of distance between package permits. The distance between package permits shall be measured from outside entrance to outside entrance. However, where a package permit is located within a structure of more than 50,000 square feet, the outside entrance of such location shall be the outer perimeter of the selling area under the permit, as shown on the approved floor plan signed by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. 
(c)  Distance restrictions. 
(1)  Distance limit to school. No package permit shall be permitted to locate, relocate or remove to any location where the outside entrance of such location is within 500 feet from the property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school. 
(2)  Distance limit between package permits. No package permit shall be permitted to locate within 1,500 feet of another package permit, except as provided in section 42.1.(d) 
(d)  Relocation or removal of permits. Except as prohibited by the distance restrictions to a school in subsection 42.1(c)(1) above, a package permit may be relocated or removed as follows: 
(1)  Permit relocation limit. A permittee may relocate a package permit within a five hundred (500) foot radius, provided said relocation shall be in accordance with the said Liquor Control Act and the rules and regulations of the State Department of Liquor Control. 
(2)  Removal due to condemnation for public or semi-public use. The relocation distance of a package permit that is removed from such use for a public or semi-public use by condemnation proceedings may be increased to a radius of 750 feet from the present site provided said removal shall be in accordance with the Liquor Control Act and the rules and regulations of the State Department of Liquor Control. 
However, where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the provisions of this subsection 42.1.(d)(2) concerning the removal of any package permit only as a result of condemnation proceedings for public or semi-public use, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, after public notice and hearing in a specific case, waive said provisions provided that the requirements set forth below are met: 
a.  The proposed location shall not be within a radius of 500 feet of another package permit; and 
b.  Sufficient evidence shall be presented to prove that no suitable location is available within a radius of 750 feet of the original location; and 
c.  Said removal shall be in accordance with the said Liquor Control Act and the rules and regulations of the Liquor Control Commission. 
(e)  Renewal of nonconforming package permit allowed. A permittee holding a package permit as a nonconforming use within the aforesaid 1,500-foot radius may continue the nonconforming use (at that location only) when the permit expires and application is made and granted for renewal of the same exact type of permit. 
(f)  Change of permit type prohibited. Any change from one type of package permit to another type of package permit shall not be permitted except in conformance with the distance restrictions of section 42.1.(c). 
(Ord. No. 1780, 8-3-15)) 
Section 42.2. - Game machines and game rooms in business and industrial districts. 
    These provisions exist in order to protect neighborhoods, minimize conflict with adjacent uses and the surrounding area, to assure the health and safety of the general public by providing adequate space for patrons and onlookers, and to provide adequate circulation within and egress from the premises.

(4)  Any establishment with three or more game machines shall provide a minimum of three feet clear space from the side of each machine and eight feet clear space from the front of each machine. 
(5)  Permission for any game machine(s) or game room may be revoked after a hearing by the board of zoning appeals, upon a finding by the board that the use generates excessive noise, loitering, littering, or traffic hazards, violates any standards of the zoning ordinance, or a condition of approval of a special exception. The zoning enforcement officer shall request a full hearing by the board if it is determined that any of the foregoing have occurred, after inspection of an establishment, or subsequent to a complaint. 
(6)  Permission to operate game machines as a fundraising activity by any religious, social, fraternal, or government unit for a limited permit, not to exceed seven days by any organization in any year, may be allowed by the zoning enforcement officer in any zoning district.

e.  Any game room with ten or more game machines shall have two lavatories open to its customers during all hours of operation. 
(c)  Uses permitted. Game machines meeting the general standards of section 42.2(b) having hours of operation not exceeding those of the principal use, no separate street or outside entrance, and no exterior sign or advertising noting their presence, shall be a permitted accessory use as follows:

Any establishment within 1,500 square feet or larger net floor area may have one game machine per 1,000 square feet gross floor area in the establishment. 
(2)  Accessory use within eating and drinking places shall be limited to two game machines in any establishment with 50 seats or less. Any establishment with 51 or more seats shall be permitted to have one (1) additional game machine for each 50 seats additional capacity. 
Table type game machines which provide no additional seating capacity shall be permitted without limit as to number, and not subject to subsection 42.2(b)(4) of this ordinance. 
(3)  Game rooms meeting the general standards of subsection 42.2(b) shall be permitted as follows: 
a.  A game room in the BE, IL and IH Districts provided no residential use is within a 500 foot radius of the establishment, shall be a permitted use.

1.  The board shall determine whether the proximity of the game room to schools, public facilities, places of worship, commercial or residential uses would negatively affect the neighborhood; and 
2.  Adequacy of sidewalk width to accommodate anticipated pedestrian traffic; and 
3.  The safety of pedestrian access to and from the proposed game room, considering the age group of its potential clientele, whether the services are within ten minutes walking distance to the facility, the presence of sidewalks along major thoroughfares along probable access routes, conflict with incompatible uses such as truck traffic, and 
4.  The probability of occurrence of loitering given the character of the surrounding uses, and past history in the immediate area. 
Section 42.3. - Adult businesses. 
    These provisions exist in order to protect neighborhoods, minimize conflict with adjacent uses and the surrounding area, and to assure the health and safety of the public. It is recognized that some uses because of their nature have serious objectionable operating characteristics, particularly when several of these uses are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect on the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area. Adult business uses subject to these controls are as follows: Adult bookstores, adult theaters, adult entertainment centers, massage parlors, rap parlors, and saunas. 
(a)  Definitions. Whenever used in this section, the following words or phrases shall have the meaning defined below:

An adult business further includes, without being limited to, adult bookstores, adult entertainment centers, adult theaters, massage parlors, rap parlors, or terms of like import. 
    ADULT BOOKSTORE: An establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade, books, magazines, films, video-tapes, compact discs or other mechanical or electronic storage devices for sale or viewing on premises by use of motion picture devices, video tape, coin-operated or electronically controlled means, and other periodicals which are distinguished or characterized by their principal emphasis on matters depicting, describing or relating to nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse, as defined below, or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale or display of such material, for sale to patrons therein. 
    ADULT ENTERTAINMENT CENTER: An enclosed building or part of an enclosed building, no portion of which is licensed to sell liquor, which contains one or more coin-operated or electronically controlled means which when activated permit a customer to view a live person unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola, or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals, or the charging of any admission or fee for the viewing of such activity. 
    ADULT THEATER: An enclosed building used regularly and routinely for presenting programs, material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matters depicting, describing or relating to nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sado-masochistic abuse, as defined below, or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale or display of such material, for observation by patrons therein. 
    MASSAGE PARLOR: An establishment or place primarily in the business of providing massage services. The term shall not include a licensed provider of massage therapy services as defined and licensed under the provision of § 20-206 C.G.S.

    SEXUAL EXCITEMENT: The condition of human male or female genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal. 
(b)  Location restrictions. 
(1)  Adult bookstores, adult theaters, and adult entertainment centers shall not be operated or maintained within 150 feet of a preexisting: 
a.  Place of worship that has a certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Public or private educational facility which serve persons age seventeen or younger. 
c.  Park. 
d.  Residential district as defined by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of New Haven (RS-1, RS-2, RM-1, RM-2, RH-1, RH-2, RO) and predominantly residential Planned Developments). 
(2)  No adult business may be located within 1,500 feet of another adult business. 
(3)  Only one adult business is permitted in a structure. 
(4)  No adult business may be located within a structure containing a bar. 
(5)  Measurement. The distance restrictions shall be measured in a straight line from the main public entrance of said premises to the lot lines of properties in residentially zoned districts without regard to intervening structures or objects, or in the instance of two adult businesses the distance between the main public entrances of each premises without regard to intervening structures or objects. 
(6)  Exterior display. Any regulated use existing on October 1, 1996 and all new regulated uses shall comply with the sign requirements herein. No merchandise or pictures of the products or entertainment on the premises shall be displayed in window areas or any area where they can be viewed from the sidewalk in front of the building. Window treatments shall conform to existing development pattern of the immediate area. 
(c)  Amortization of existing adult businesses. Any adult business lawfully operating on the effective date of this ordinance that is in violation of subsection 42.3(b)(1) shall be deemed a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be permitted to continue for a period not to exceed three years, unless sooner terminated for any reason or voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days or more. Such nonconforming uses shall not be increased, enlarged, or extended or altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. The provisions of this section may have limited enforceability within the parameters of existing state law. 
(d)  Determining nonconformity. If two or more adult business uses are within 1,500 feet of one another and otherwise in a permissible location, only the adult business which was first established and continually operating at a particular location is deemed the nonconforming the conforming use and the later-established adult business(es) is (are) non conforming. 
(e)  Waiver of location restriction. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a special exception to waive the location restrictions if the following findings are made: 
(1)  That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this section (42.3.) will be observed. 
(2)  That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a "combat zone". 
(3)  That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation or commercial revitalization, nor will it interfere with any program of urban renewal. 
(4)  That all applicable regulations of this section of the Zoning Ordinance will be observed. 
(f)  All ordinances or parts of ordinances conflicting with any of the provisions of this ordinance amendment for the purpose of governance of adult businesses shall be repealed. 
Section 42.4. - Regulation of gun shops and associated goods sales. 
(a)  Definitions. 
    GUN SHOP: Any establishment or portion of an establishment which sells guns, firearms or associated goods including ammunition and gun sights. 
(b)  Uses permitted. These provisions exist in order to protect neighborhoods, minimize conflict with adjacent uses and the surrounding area, and to assure the health and safety of the general public by providing additional standards for review of a proposed location of a gun shop and to prevent a concentration of such uses. 
Gun shops shall be permitted in the BD, BD-1, BE, IL and IH districts by special exception subject to the review standards of § 63(d), and distance restrictions, supplementary review standards and conditions of approval of this § 42.4. 
(c)  Distance restrictions. 
(1)  Distance limit to schools. No establishment for sale of guns, firearms and associated goods including ammunition and gun sights shall be permitted to locate, relocate or remove to any location where the property line of such location is within 500 feet from the property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school as delineated in § 42.4(c). 
(2)  Distance limit to residential districts. No sale of guns, firearms and associated goods including ammunition and gun sights shall be permitted within 500 feet of a residential district (RS-1, RS-2, RM-1, RM-2, RH-1, RH-2, RO and predominantly residential Planned Developments) as delineated in §42.4(c). 
(3)  Distance limit between gun shops. No gun shop shall be permitted within 1,500 feet of another such use. 
(d)  Measurement of distances. The distance between gun shops shall be measured from property line to property line. However, where a gun shop is located within a structure of more than 50,000 square feet, the distance shall be measured from the outside entrance of such location, as shown on the approved floor plan signed by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, to the gun shop, property line of the public or private elementary or secondary school, or boundary of the residential district. 
(e)  Supplementary review standards. Sale of guns, firearms and accessory goods including ammunition has a greater potential impact on surrounding uses and the surrounding area, compared for the public need for them at particular locations. For this reason the supplementary standards herein shall be taken into account, where appropriate, in addition to the standards of § 63(d) of this ordinance. 
(1)  The presence or physical concentration of pawn shops, second hand goods stores, bars, package permits, adult businesses or other such uses. 
(2)  Known locations where loitering, drug sales, violent crime or prostitution have regularly occurred over substantial time periods as documented by the department of police services or other governmental agencies. 
(f)  Additional conditions of approval. Because of the unique safety and security needs of gun shops and the potential impact on surrounding uses and the surrounding area compared for the public need for a gun shop at a particular location, the board of zoning appeals may require any of the following as additional conditions of approval. 
(1)  Secure storage and display areas, including a security system. 
(2)  Security door or window grates. 
(3)  Exterior lighting or site fencing. 
(4)  Limited site access during non-business hours by means of fences, chains or means specified by the board. 
The decision may also incorporate the following provisions of federal and/or state law: 
(5)  No assault weapon as defined in P.L. 93-306 (or latest version) may be sold, bartered or transferred. 
(6)  No guns, firearms and associated goods including ammunition and gun sights shall be permitted to be sold, bartered or transferred to anyone under twenty-one years of age in accordance with C.G.S. §29-34. 
(7)  Each firearm sold, bartered or transferred shall be accompanied by a gun locking device and warning at the time of sale in accordance C.G.S. § 29-37b. 
Section 42.5. - Special provisions for certain uses operating between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
    These provisions exist in order to minimize conflict of businesses with adjacent residential uses and the surrounding area, and to assure the peace, tranquility, health and safety of the public. It is recognized that some uses because of their nature have serious objectionable operating characteristics, particularly when close to residential uses, thereby having a deleterious effect on the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing or limiting late night traffic, noise, loitering, littering and crime in business places which are located adjacent to residential uses. 
(a)  Applicability. The standards contained herein shall be applied to certain uses found in the section 42, Use regulations for business and industrial districts, except if located in a Business D or Business D-1 District: 
(1)  All uses found in section 42.C: Sale of food, drink and pharmaceuticals. 
(2)  Pawn shop or swap shop. 
(3)  All uses found in section 42.B: Transient lodging. 
(4)  Adult entertainment establishments. 
(5)  Gun shops and accessory goods sales. 
(6)  All uses found in section 42.L: Amusements 
(7)  All uses found in section 42.M: Automotive 
(b)  General standards and review of uses to operate between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. A use listed in section 42.5.(a) shall be closed between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless located in a Business D or Business D-1 District or granted a special exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to section 63(d). Application for a special exception may be made by a current or proposed operator only with written consent of the owner of the property. The special exception, if granted, is not transferable and may only be granted for a maximum of three (3) years. 
(1)  Specific standards: 
a.  The applicant must demonstrate the need to service the community between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.; 
b.  The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed hours of operation will not contribute to illegal activity at or in close proximity to the proposed use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the presence of loiterers, drugs sales or prostitution or other criminal activities and/or nuisances in close proximity to the location proposed, given the character of surrounding uses and past history in the immediate area as may be presented by the Department of Police Services, neighborhood organizations and area residents and business people; 
c.  The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed hours of operation will not have an adverse effect on abutting or proximate uses, including places of worship, parks, playgrounds, youth services facilities, or residences; and 
d.  The applicant must identify all other uses within 200 feet of the proposed location which are operating between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The Board shall consider the potential clustering of uses in a manner that may be inconsistent or inappropriate for the surrounding area. 
(c)  Special conditions of approval. The Board may impose conditions of approval including but not limited to special lighting, fencing, landscaping, signage, supervised parking, trash receptacles, or outside staff/official and unofficial security for some or all hours of late night operation.

Figure 43.2 BA-1 Yard Requirements 
(11)  Design guidelines: The following design guidelines should apply to all buildings in a BA-1 District only. They should to the greatest extent possible, be incorporated into the design of new buildings and the renovation of existing structures. Guidelines shall apply when there are proposed modifications to a building façade to include replacement of windows, replacement of façade materials, or additions to or extensions of a façade. 
a.  General design principles: Emphasis should be on a pedestrian-scaled environment. Buildings should harmoniously blend with the existing neighborhood character. All materials, colors, and architectural details used on the exterior of a building should be compatible with the building style, and with each other. A building designed of an architectural style that normally includes certain integral materials, colors, and/or details should incorporate such into its design. Plans should reflect an attention to detail, the use of quality materials, and good craftsmanship. 
b.  Scale, mass and continuity: Buildings should generally relate in scale and design to the surrounding buildings where such buildings represent quality construction and design associated with historical development of the area. Buildings should reflect a continuity of treatment in the following ways: 
1.  Maintain, when appropriate, the building mass and scale of adjacent buildings. 
2.  Maintain front yard build-to lines. 
3.  Maintain cornice and transition lines in buildings of the same height. 
4.  Primary horizontal and vertical lines in the architectural composition should remain visible or be incorporated into the design. 
c.  Building entrances: All entrances to a building should be defined and articulated by architectural elements of the building. Any such element utilized should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors, and details of the building as a whole. 
d.  Fenestration: The arrangement and design of windows and doors in a building should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the building. Windows should be vertically proportioned wherever possible. To the extent possible, upper story windows should be vertically aligned with the location of windows and doors on the ground level, including storefront or display windows. All windows should be stylistically consistent with the building and energy efficient. 
e.  Roofs: Roof types should be appropriate to a building's architectural type. Embellishments such as dormers, belvederes, masonry chimneys, cupolas, clock towers and other such embellishments are encouraged if appropriate to the building vernacular. Repairs to existing construction should conform to the building vernacular. 
f.  Buildings on corner lots: Buildings on corner lots should be considered important structures because they contain more than one façade that is exposed to the street. These buildings should be enhanced with appropriate architectural embellishments. 
g.  Façades: The architectural treatment of the front façade should be continued, in its major features, around all visibly exposed sides of a building. All sides of a building should be architecturally designed to be consistent with regard to style, materials, colors, and details. Deteriorated materials should be restored to actual function if possible, and if not possible, should be replaced with similar materials that have the same form and surface characteristics without visually changing the façade's character. New buildings should, at street level, have clear glass windows sufficiently transparent to provide views into the interior of the building. 
h.  Storefront façades: Storefronts should be integrally designed as part of the entire façade. Buildings with multiple storefronts should be architecturally uniform throughout through the use of architecturally compatible materials, colors, details, awnings, canopies and marquees. 
i.  Signage and lighting fixtures: Attachments and/or fixtures should complement the architectural design of the façade and should be appropriate in scale to the ornamentation and the design elements of the building. Fixtures and attachments should not obscure historically significant materials, architectural features or decorative details. 
j.  Signage: Signage should be architecturally compatible with style, materials, color and details of the building and neighborhood. 
k.  Awnings, canopies and marquees: Awnings, canopies and marquees are permitted at ground level. Such treatments should be designed to complement the building and should be compatible with the materials, colors, and details of the building and neighborhood. In buildings with multiple storefronts compatible awnings, canopies and marquees should be used as a means to unify the building. Solid, lighted awnings and canopies are not permitted. Vinyl awnings are not permitted. 
(12)  Special permit: All proposed uses of greater than 5,000 net square feet, whether located in new or existing structures, shall require a Special Permit in order to ensure that such relatively large proposals are compatible with and meet the general criteria and standards of the Business A-1 and Business A-2 Districts as described and defined in Section 41. 
(Ord. No. 1410, § 3, 3-20-06; Ord. No. 1412 (Rev. Sched. A, §§ 6, 7), 5-1-06; Ord. No. 1614, § 1, 3-1-10; Ord. No. 1685, Sched. D, 8-6-12; Ord. No. 1696, Sched. A, 5-6-13; Ord. No. 1726, Sched.

a.  The total area of all such signs for each establishment shall not exceed four square feet in the case of the Business D District and the Business D-3 District, or three square feet in the case of all other business and industrial districts, for each foot of length of the front building wall (or length of that portion of such wall which is devoted to such establishment) with the following qualifications: 
1.  If such establishment has walls fronting on two or more streets, the sign area for each such street shall be computed separately; 
2.  If any on premises sign or signs of such establishment project more than 12 inches beyond any street line, the maximum area per foot of length of the front building wall (or portion) shall be reduced by one square foot; 
3.  If such establishment does not occupy any floor area on the ground level of the building , other than an entryway, the maximum area per foot of length of the front building wall (or portion) shall be reduced by two square feet; 
4.

Section 44.1. - Off premises signs. 
    Statement of purpose. The purpose of these sign regulations is to: 
  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; and 
  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and New Haven's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; and 
  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; and 
  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and 
  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. 
It is recognized that signs perform important functions in identifying businesses and in general advertising. It has been determined that without adequate controls the number of signs in New Haven may become excessive and unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, negatively affect views and vistas, including those from and of important geographic landmarks or landmark structures, and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. 
It is hereby found and declared that the signs of lesser importance in occupying limited public views available to people within New Haven are those that convey messages for products, services, events, persons, institutions or businesses other than on the premises where the sign is located, or for the sale or rental of such premises. These regulations are also determined to be the minimum necessary to achieve these purposes. 
(a)  Definitions. 
    OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SIGN: See sign, off premises. 
    SIGN, OFF PREMISES: A sign which directs attention to a business, commodity, industry or other activity which is sold, offered or conducted elsewhere than on the premises upon which sign is located, or to which is affixed, and which is sold, offered or conducted on such premises only incidentally if at all. Commonly, but not limited to, standardized steel structures that carry messages. 
Included in this category are the following off premises sign types: 
BULLETIN: An off premises sign oriented to a limited access highway, generally 18 feet × 48 feet and externally lit. 
SPECTACULAR: An off premises sign oriented to a limited access highway, generally 18 feet × 48 feet and internally lit. 
(b)  Off premises signs. Off premises signs , commonly referred to as outdoor advertising, advertising billboard, billboard, bulletin, or spectacular signs, which advertise products or businesses not connected with the site or building on which they are located, are deemed to constitute a separate use. The widespread display of off premises signs is deemed to be inappropriate to the character and sound development of the City of New Haven. Such signs shall be allowed only as follows: 
(1)  Locations permitted. 
a.  Bulletin or spectacular. These signs, oriented to a limited access highway within a BA, BB, BE, IL or IH district, shall be permitted as shown on a map entitled Bulletin and Spectacular Sign Zoning Map Overlay District, on file with the City Clerk and the City Plan Department.

a.  Owned by or under long-term lease to the owner of such structure or use , with appropriate deed restrictions and long-term leases recorded on the New Haven Land Records; or 
b.  Made available on a long-term basis by a public agency or agencies, with written certification from such public agency or agencies as to such availability. 
(6)  Shared Parking. Where it is proposed that two or more uses for which a parking or loading space or spaces are required make joint use of the same parking or loading space or spaces, such joint use shall not be permitted unless: 
a.  An appropriate contract between the parties concerned, providing for long-term joint use of such parking or loading, is recorded on the New Haven Land Records; and 
b.  A special exception is granted under the provisions of subsection 63(d), upon a finding, among other things, that the proposed joint use of parking or loading will meet the requirements of this ordinance for the two or more uses involved at the time when such uses are in operation. 
c.  In addition to the circumstances set forth in subsections a. and b., in the Business D-3 District, shared parking will be allowed as follows: 
1.  The building is a mixed-use building, and there is evidence established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Department of Transportation, Traffic and Parking, which shall provide a report to the City Plan Commission in connection with a site plan application for the building that one-half of the residential requirement for such building , if counted toward the non-residential parking requirements of the building, will not adversely affect the residential use in the building. 
2.  The on-site parking provided for a nonresidential building is publicly shared parking, in which case the parking requirements for the uses in the nonresidential building shall be reduced by 15 percent. 
3.  Two or more uses and/or structures agree to shared parking, an agreement providing for the shared use of parking executed by the parties involved is filed on the land records of the City of New Haven, and the parking for such uses or structures occur at alternating time periods, which shall be established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Department of Transportation, Traffic and Parking which shall provide a report to the City Plan Commission in connection with the site plan applications for such uses and/or structures. In such case, the number of parking spaces required for each use or structure shall be reduced by 25 percent. 
(7)  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to lessen the requirements of this ordinance as to the number of parking or loading spaces required and/or increase the maximum allowable walking distance to such parking spaces , but only upon a finding that either particular circumstance or mitigative measures qualify such action. Particular circumstance may include, but not be limited to availability of public parking, proximity to public transit or significant levels of pedestrian access. Mitigative measures may include, but not be limited to van and/or car pooling, public parking validation programs, flexible work schedules or other transportation demand management measures.

7.  Whether or not vehicles awaiting dismantling or retained for sale or use intact are or will be stored in improved parking areas specifically designated for this use; 
8.  Presence of other potential nuisance sources and evaluation of the cumulative impacts on public health and safety; 
9.  Criteria set forth in section 64(e), as appropriate; 
10.  Whether the existing facility at the time of issuance with its most recently-issued special permit was substantially compatible with the surrounding neighborhood; 
11.  The length of time the existing facility has been operating at the site and its history of compliance with its most recently-issued special permit. 
e.  If, in the opinion of the Commission, circumstances have changed sufficiently to warrant a change in the prior decision, the application for renewal may be denied. 
(6)  Specific standards-Existing nonconforming facilities.

The Commission may allow the applicant additional time, up to three years, to comply with the regulations, provided a specific schedule for the same has been approved by the Commission and met by the applicant. In situations where compliance with some of the enumerated standards is impossible, economically impractical, or otherwise unduly burdensome due to physical features of the site or other conditions beyond the control of the applicant, the Commission may waive compliance. However, the additional time or waiver may be granted only if there is no substantial detriment to the public health and safety and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of these regulations. 
(7)  Right of entry. To the extent permitted by law, owners or operators shall authorize agents and employees of the City of New Haven to enter, examine, or survey the premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of compliance inspections, whether or not there is prior evidence of non-compliance.

g.  The owner and/or operator's substantial failure to comply with these regulations, or otherwise constructing or operating the facility so as to cause a threat to the public health or safety. 
Such action by the Commission may include ordering other appropriate relief, including but not limited to ordering submission of a closure plan. 
(e)  Dumping. Dumping, as defined below and subject to the following regulations (whether inside or outside a building ) shall be permitted only by special exception for a maximum period of two years. 
(1)  DUMPING: The discarding or depositing of any waste, or any material incapable of being reused in some form, other than clean fill such as sand, soil, gravel, rock or clay. 
(2)  All dumping shall be carried on in such a manner as to prevent the breeding or harboring of rats, insects, or other vermin. 
(3)  The dumping area shall be periodically bull-dozed or otherwise treated to cover dumped materials with soil or other such substance. 
(4)  Fire hazards shall be prevented by all necessary measures.

(2)  Necessary precautions, through fencing or otherwise, shall be taken to prevent injury to the public. 
(3)  At the conclusion of quarrying operations on any part of the property, the operator of such quarry shall re-establish a uniform contour of the ground level and shall provide a suitable ground cover. A bond satisfactory to the zoning enforcement officer and the corporation counsel may be required to assure compliance with this paragraph (3). 
(g)  Household hazardous waste collection centers. Household hazardous waste collection centers shall be subject to the following regulations: 
(1)  HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION CENTER: Any land or structure used for the collection, packing, consolidation, storage, and transfer of any waste materials generated from homes or similar sources that are defined as household hazardous waste by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including materials that are either hazardous wastes as listed in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33(e) or (f), or wastes that exhibit any of the following characteristics as defined in 40 CFR Parts 261.21-261.24: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and EP toxicity. 
(2)  A household hazardous waste collection center must meet all applicable requirements of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and may be constructed and operated only with valid permits as required by the DEP solid waste and hazardous materials units and subject to DEP management and monitoring requirements. 
(3)  All discarded and waste materials at a household hazardous waste collection center must be stored within structures, storage tanks, or containers that provide protection from weather, vermin and vandalism. All hazardous waste materials must be stored within enclosed structures which meet all applicable requirements of the department of fire service and the Connecticut DEP for segregation of combustible and incompatible materials, fire rating, containment of leaks and spills, and other safety measures necessary to protect site personnel, surrounding structures, public health, and the environment. 
(h)  Solid waste. Solid waste facilities as defined herein may be allowed in the IH District by special permit for a maximum of five years. Such facilities are subject to the following regulations (whether operations occur inside or outside a building): 
(1)  Statement of purpose. In order to promote, protect and preserve the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City of New Haven, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest that the accumulation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of solid waste be regulated. The City of New Haven is authorized by General Statutes § 22a-208a to regulate, through zoning, land usage for solid waste disposal. 
Solid waste facilities are disproportionately concentrated in New Haven, particularly in the IH district, adjacent to residential neighborhoods, public recreation areas, food establishments, and small businesses. Concentrations of waste facilities can attract and generate many problems for communities, including objectionable noise, odor, litter and traffic. Diesel fumes and dust can degrade air quality and aggravate allergies and other health problems existing in the affected communities. The problem is compounded by the increasingly-regional nature of these facilities, and the trend towards larger and larger facilities. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City that the burden of fulfilling the need for solid waste facilities shall not fall disproportionately on any community and that the construction of new solid waste facilities as defined in section 46(h)(2) a through i hereof shall not be permitted within the limits of the City of New Haven.

(j)  Limits of appropriation. The commission may, subject to the limits of appropriation made by the City of New Haven, employ or utilize clerical and technical assistance or consultants and may accept money, gifts, and expend the same for such purposes.

Section 55. - Coastal Management District. 
    Description and purpose. The coastal management district exists to ensure that the development, preservation or use of the land and water resources of the coastal area proceeds in a manner consistent with the capability of the land and water resources to support development, preservation or use without disrupting either the natural environment or sound economic growth and to ensure public access along the city's waterfront and the preservation of a natural viewpoints and vistas. These values are not readily classified within existing district regulations and are accordingly given a distinct classification in addition to existing district classifications so as to best serve the interest of the city and the region. 
    Summary of review process. A coastal site plan review shall be conducted in accordance with this section for all buildings, structures, uses or activities to be located within the coastal management district. The review shall determine whether or not the potential adverse impacts of the proposed activity on coastal resources and future water-dependent development activities are acceptable under the Connecticut Coastal Management Act, Chapter 444 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.

The Connecticut Coastal Management Act, also know as Sections 22a-90 to 22a-112 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended from time to time, establishes the Connecticut coastal boundary, defines coastal resources, coastal site plans, adverse impacts on coastal resources and water-dependent uses and specifies the requirements and procedures for municipalities to follow in preparing coastal programs and conducting coastal site plan reviews. 
(a)  Uses permitted. The coastal management district permits such residential and non-residential uses as are permitted and in the same manner as in the underlying zone, provided the coastal site plan review, if required, determines that the potential adverse impacts of the proposed use on both coastal resources and future water-dependent development activities are acceptable within the meaning of the Connecticut Coastal Management Act, as amended. 
(b)  Administration of coastal site plan review: 
(1)  Written certification required: No building permit shall be issued for a building, use or structure located within the coastal management district unless the zoning enforcement officer certifies in writing that such building, use or structure has been reviewed and approved in accordance with the Connecticut Coastal Management Act, as amended, or is a use exempt from such review as provided in this section.

(3)  Any proposed new construction in excess of 1,500 square feet shall require a special permit approval. 
(4)  New buildings in the overlay district shall have a zero set back from the prevailing building line. 
(5)  New buildings, where the lot has frontage greater than 50 feet, shall be designed to cover 75 percent of the lot frontage. 
(f)  Design guidelines. The following guidelines shall, to the greatest extent possible, be incorporated into the design of new buildings and the renovation of existing structures. Guidelines shall apply when there are proposed modifications to a building facade to include replacement of windows, replacement of facade materials, or additions to or extensions of a facade. 
(1)  General design principles: Emphasis should be on a pedestrian-scaled environment. Buildings should harmoniously blend in and balance each other. All materials, colors, and architectural details used on the exterior of a building should be compatible with the building style, and with each other. A building designed of an architectural style that normally includes certain integral materials, colors, and/ or details should incorporate such into its design. Plans should reflect an attention to detail, the use of quality materials, and good craftsmanship. Bare cinder block construction is not permitted. Drivet may be used providing that not more than 20 percent of the facade is covered with this material. 
(2)  Scale, mass and continuity: Buildings shall generally relate in scale and design to the surrounding buildings where such buildings represent quality construction and design associated with historical development of the area. Buildings shall reflect a continuity of treatment the following ways: 
a.  Maintain, when appropriate, the building mass and scale of adjacent buildings. 
b.  Maintain front yard build-to lines. 
c.  Maintain cornice and transition lines in buildings of the same height. 
d.  Primary horizontal and vertical lines in the architectural composition should remain visible or be incorporated into the design. 
(3)  Building entrances: All entrances to a building should be defined and articulated by architectural elements of the building. Any such element utilized shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors, and details of the building as a whole. 
(4)  Fenestration: The arrangement and design of windows and doors in a building shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the building. Windows shall be vertically proportioned wherever possible. To the extent possible, upper story windows shall be vertically aligned with the location of windows and doors on the ground level, including storefront or display windows. All windows shall be stylistically consistent with the building and energy efficient. 
(5)  Roofs: Roof types shall be appropriate to a buildings architectural type. Embellishments such as dormers, belvederes, masonry chimneys, cupolas, clock towers and other such embellishments are encouraged if appropriate to the building vernacular. Repairs to existing construction shall conform to the building vernacular. 
(6)  Buildings on corner lots: Buildings on corner lots shall be considered important structures because they contain more than one facade that is exposed to the street. These buildings should be enhanced with appropriate architectural embellishments. 
(7)  Facades: The architectural treatment of the front facade shall be continued, in its major features, around all visibly exposed sides of a building. All sides of a building shall be architecturally designed to be consistent with regard to style, materials, colors, and details. Deteriorated materials should be restored to actual function if possible, and if not possible, should be replaced with similar materials that have the same form and surface characteristics without visually changing the facade's character. New buildings shall, at street level, have clear glass windows sufficiently transparent to provide views into the interior of the building. 
(8)  Storefront facades: Storefronts shall be integrally designed as part of the entire facade. Buildings with multiple storefronts shall be architecturally uniform throughout and shall be unified through the use of architecturally compatible materials, colors, details, awnings, canopies and marquees, signage and lighting fixtures. Attachments and/or fixtures should complement the architectural design of the facade and should be appropriate in scale to the ornamentation and the design elements of the building. Fixtures and attachments should not obscure historically significant materials, architectural features or decorative details. 
(9)  Signage: Signage shall be architecturally compatible with style, materials, color and details of the building. 
(10)  Awnings, canopies and marquees: Awnings, canopies and marquees are permitted at ground level. Such treatments shall be designed to complement the building and shall be compatible with the materials, colors, and details of the building. In buildings with multiple storefronts compatible awnings, canopies and marquees should be used as a means to unify the building. Solid, lighted awnings and canopies are not permitted. 
(11)  Light fixtures: Light fixtures shall be architecturally compatible with style, materials, color and details of the building. 
(12)  Security applications: Solid metal security gates or solid roll-down metal windows shall not be permitted. Link or grill type security devices shall be permitted. If installed on the outside, the coil boss shall be recessed and concealed behind the building wall. 
(Ord. No. 1420, § 1, 6-5-06) 
Section 60. - Stormwater management plans. 
(a)  Purpose and authority. Increased development without proper consideration of stormwater impacts can be a significant source of pollution to Long Island Sound, its tributaries, and other waters of the state. The state's water resources are valuable natural, economic, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic resources. The protection and preservation of these waters is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the City of New Haven. It is, therefore, the purpose of this ordinance to protect and preserve the waters within New Haven from nonpoint sources of pollution through the proper management of stormwater flows and minimization of inputs of suspended solid, pathogens, toxic contaminants, nitrogen, and floatable debris to these flows. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Aquifer: Geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated, permeable materials to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs. 
    BMPs-best management practices: Techniques or structural devices that are effective practical ways of preventing or reducing pollution. 
    First inch of rain: The first inch of rainfall during a single event. 
    Groundwater: Water found beneath the ground surface that completely fills the open spaces between particles of sediment and within rock formations. 
    Impervious surface: Material or structure on, above, or below the ground that does not allow precipitation or surface water to penetrate directly into the soil. 
    Sediment: Solid material, either mineral or organic, that is in suspension, is transported, or has been moved from its site or origin by erosion. 
    Site: A single parcel, together with any adjacent waters, which is the subject of an application for zoning approval, coastal site plan review, or an inland wetlands permit. 
    Trash hood: Feature in a catch basin which traps debris such as litter and keeps it from being discharged from the catch basin. 
    Urban stormwater runoff: Precipitation that falls onto the surfaces of roofs, streets, parking lots, roads, and the grounds of developed areas. Urban precipitation is not absorbed by the ground or retained in its surface, but collects and runs off, carrying a wide variety of pollutants such as oil-based contaminants, heavy metals (copper and lead), nutrients, and bacteria. 
(c)  Application requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be included as a part of any application for zoning approval (including but not limited to special permit and special exception), coastal site plan review, or an inland wetlands permit where: 
(1)  The application pertains to a development or construction disturbing one-half or more acres of total land area on a site; or 
(2)  The application pertains to any site with one-half acre or more of existing and/or proposed impervious cover; or 
(3)  The application proposes new residential development of three or more units; or 
(4)  The application pertains to any new or expanding industrial or commercial use which increases the amount of on-site impervious surface by more than 500 square feet; or 
(5)  The application pertains to any site within the coastal boundary as defined in section 22a-94 of the General Statutes; or 
(6)  The commission which has jurisdiction over the application has required submission of a stormwater management plan pursuant to written findings by that commission that the activity proposed in the application has the potential to cause significant nonpoint source pollution to groundwater or surface water drinking supplies, or to Long Island Sound, or any other waters of the state. 
    If the commission which has jurisdiction determines that the activity proposed in an application may result in significant nonpoint source pollution to groundwater or surface water drinking supplies, or to Long Island Sound or any other waters of the state, it may refer the application, including the stormwater management plan, to the Commissioner of Environmental Protection for a determination as to whether a discharge permit under section 22a-130 of the General Statutes, or other state authorization, is required. 
    The commission which has jurisdiction over the application may, upon request, waive some or all of the requirements of this section if it makes a finding based on the proposed project that such requirements are not necessary to determine the impact of the proposed project on the surface or groundwater of the state. 
(d)  Contents of stormwater management plan. Where a stormwater management plan is required, such plan shall provide, at a minimum, the following information: 
(1)  Soil characteristics of the site. 
(2)  Location of the closest surface water bodies and wetlands to the site, and the depth to any groundwater or aquifer areas on or adjacent to the site. In the case of tidal waters, provide the mean high water and high tide elevations. 
(3)  DEP ground and surface water quality classification of waterbodies on and adjacent to the site. 
(4)  Identification of any waterbodies on and adjacent to the site documented by DEP as not meeting water quality standards. 
(5)  Location and description of all proposed stormwater control BMPs for both construction activities and post-construction, long-term stormwater control. 
(6)  Proposed operation and maintenance manual and a schedule for maintaining any trash hoods, catch basins, or other BMP devices used to prevent runoff, facilitate sheet flow or infiltration, or treat stormwater. 
(7)  Calculations of stormwater runoff rates, suspended solids removal rates, and soil infiltration rates before and after completion of the activity proposed in the application. 
(8)  A hydrologic study of pre-development site conditions. Hydrology studies shall be conducted at a level of detail commensurate with the probable impact of the proposed activity and should extend downstream to the point where the proposed activity causes less than a five percent change in the peak flow rates. 
(e)  Standards and criteria for decision. In order to approve any application for which a stormwater management plan is required, the commission shall find the stormwater management plan consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  Direct channeling of untreated surface water runoff into adjacent ground and surface waters shall be prohibited. 
(2)  No net increase in the peak rate or total volume of stormwater runoff from the site, to the maximum extent possible, shall result from the proposed activity. 
(3)  Design and planning for site development shall provide for minimal disturbance of pre-development natural hydrologic conditions, and shall reproduce such conditions after completion of the proposed activity, to the maximum extent feasible. 
(4)  Pollutants shall be controlled at their source to the maximum extent feasible in order to contain and minimize contamination. 
(5)  Stormwater management systems shall be designed and maintained to manage site runoff in order to reduce surface and groundwater pollution, prevent flooding, and control peak discharges and provide pollution treatment. 
(6)  Stormwater management systems shall be designed to collect, retain, and treat the first inch of rain on-site, so as to trap floating material, oil, and litter. 
(7)  On-site infiltration and on-site storage of stormwater shall be employed to the maximum extent feasible. 
(8)  Post-development runoff rates and volumes shall not exceed pre-development rates and volumes for various storm events. Stormwater runoff rates and volumes shall be controlled by infiltration and on-site detention systems designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Connecticut except where detaining such flow will affect upstream flow rates under various storm conditions. 
(9)  Stormwater treatment systems shall be employed where necessary to ensure that the average annual loadings of total suspended solids (TSS) following the completion of the proposed activity at the site are no greater than such loadings prior to the proposed activity. Alternatively, stormwater treatment systems shall remove 80 percent TSS from the site on an average annual basis. 
(10)  Use of available BMPs to minimize or mitigate the volume, rate, and impact of stormwater to ground or surface waters. 
(Ord. No. 1662, 9-19-11) 
Section 60.1. - Exterior lighting. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of exterior lighting standards is to maximize the effectiveness of site lighting, enhance public safety and welfare and conserve energy, while discouraging the installation of lighting fixtures that emit objectionable illumination, avoid unnecessary upward illumination or unwanted illumination of adjacent properties and to reduce glare. 
(b)  Applicability. A lighting plan shall be included as a part of any application for zoning approval (including but not limited to site plan, special permit, special exception and planned developments). 
(c)  Plan contents. A lighting plan shall include a plan sheet identifying the location of all exterior lights and the type of fixture and elevation of such lights. The lighting plan shall also include manufacturer specifications or cut sheets for each exterior lighting fixture.

(a)  Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO). The Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) is charged with enforcing the ordinance through examining plans, inspections, keeping records, and ordering compliance. 
(b)  Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals hears and decides cases in which it is claimed either that some ruling of the Zoning Enforcement Officer was in error, or that special circumstances require a variance from the strict terms of the ordinance, or that certain privileges are justified as special exceptions. 
(c)  City Plan Commission. The City Plan Commission is responsible for a continuous review of the effectiveness of the ordinance, advice to the Board of Aldermen on proposed changes in the ordinance, and advice to the Zoning Enforcement Officer, the Board of Zoning Appeals and other agencies. 
(d)  Board of Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen is charged with the administrative responsibility of hearing and deciding applications under the circumstances enumerated in the ordinance. 
The functions of each of these agencies are necessary to the smooth and purposeful administration of the zoning program. 
Section 62. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Responsibility. The Director of the Office of Building Inspection and Enforcement (OBIE) shall be the Zoning Enforcement officer (ZEO) and shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The director may deputize one or more staff members as well as members of other city departments who have a particular skill or competence to act for the director, and the term ZEO as used elsewhere in this ordinance shall be deemed to include such deputies, but no order or other enforcement action shall be issued unless approved and signed or countersigned by the director or designated OBIE staff. 
(b)  Interpretation. The Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) shall give information upon request as to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall interpret the meaning of the ordinance in the course of enforcement. 
(c)  Review of construction plans. In all cases where a building permit is required, and in all other cases of construction or use where any provision of the zoning ordinance is involved, appropriate plans shall be filed in duplicate, subject to the provisions of the Building Code and to such other rules as the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) shall prescribe, sufficient in scope and character to determine that all relevant requirements of the zoning ordinance have been met. No building permit shall be issued until the ZEO has determined and certified that such plans comply fully with the zoning ordinance. In cases where the particular skill or competence of some other City Department is relevant to an evaluation of the plans under the zoning ordinance, the ZEO may refer such plans to such department for a report. Other City departments shall take cognizance of the zoning ordinance before issuing permits under their own jurisdiction. 
(d)  Inspections. The Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) is authorized to inspect or cause to be inspected any building or other structure or any land on which work is in progress, and to order the stoppage of any work being done in violation of the zoning ordinance. The ZEO shall inspect or cause to be inspected such premises after work is completed, and shall not issue a certificate of occupancy (C of O) until such final inspection has been made, except that a temporary certificate of occupancy (C of O) may be issued in an appropriate case before work is completed, for a period of not more than six months. 
(e)  Certificates of occupancy. No structure or land or part thereof shall hereafter be occupied or used, in any case of establishment of a new use, extension or alteration of a use, or conversion from one use to another use, until the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO ) shall issue a certificate of occupancy (C of O), certifying that the zoning ordinance has been complied with in full. Upon request of the owner or tenant or any conforming or nonconforming use already established, the ZEO shall issue a certificate of occupancy (C of O) stating the exact status of such use. In the case of other uses already established, the ZEO may carry on such programs of registration of uses and issuance of certificates of occupancy (C of O) as deemed appropriate.

f.  Other such remedies as are and as may from time to time be provided for or allowed by state law for a violation of this Zoning Ordinance. 
(g)  Administrative regulations. The Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) shall have the power to adopt such administrative regulations as deemed necessary to the carrying out of these enforcement responsibilities, which regulations shall have general applicability to cases of similar character. 
(h)  Other duties. The Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) may perform such other duties as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, and shall have the same powers, duties and privileges, with respect to the zoning ordinance, as are applicable to an officer acting under the State Building Code. The ZEO shall maintain permanent and current records, prescribe such rules and forms as deemed necessary, refer appropriate cases to the Board of Zoning Appeals under section 63, investigate complaints and carry on an inspection program throughout the city, and issue written orders for compliance with the zoning ordinance, subject to the penalties (for owner, agent, lessee, tenant, architect, builder, contractor or other person) prescribed in sections 186 and 187 of the New Haven Charter. The ZEO shall also maintain a current register of nonconforming uses under section 67 of this ordinance, and regulate the registration of nonconforming uses. 
(i)  Appeals. An appeal from an administrative order of the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) may be taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in section 63, except that an appeal of an administrative order of the ZEO enforcing the orders and regulations of the Historic District Commission shall be to the Superior Court as provided by section 54 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1416, §§ 1, 2, 5-1-06) 
Section 63. - Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(a)  Establishment. 
(1)  Composition. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall operate under Section 4 of Article VII, of the New Haven Charter and any other applicable provision of such Charter or of the General Statutes of Connecticut. In addition to the three regular members appointed in accordance with Section 1A of Article VII of the New Haven Charter, the Mayor of the City of New Haven shall have the power to appoint two alternate members to the Board, as provided in section 8-5 of the General Statutes. In addition to the two regular members appointed in accordance with Section 1A of Article VII of the New Haven Charter, the Leadership of the Board of Alders, as defined by Section 2-37 of the Code of General Ordinances, shall have the power to appoint one alternate member to the Board, as provided in section 8-5 of the General Statutes. The terms of said appointees shall be five years. The President shall communicate the order approving the Board of Alders' appointment of the regular and alternate Board of Zoning Appeals members to the full Board. Upon communication, said order shall be executed in the same manner as Board and Commission appointments made by the Mayor. 
(2)  Order of appointment. The Mayor and the Board of Alders shall fill vacancies to the Board of Zoning Appeals in an order that ensures the composition prescribed in Section 4 of Article VII of the New Haven Charter, in Section 2-552 of the Code of General Ordinances, and in paragraph 63(a)(1) of this ordinance. 
(b)  Review of administrative orders. Any person claiming to be aggrieved by any order, requirement or decision made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer except for decisions concerning the enforcement of the Historic District Commission's orders and regulations, may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided in section 185 of the New Haven Charter, and the Board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify such order, decision or requirement appealed from, and it shall have all the powers of the authority from whose decision such appeal shall have been taken. Normally, such review by the board shall be limited to alleged errors in interpretation of the ordinance. 
(c)  Variances. 
(1)  Basis. Where there is difficulty or unreasonable hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have power in a specific case to vary the application of any provision of the ordinance, if such variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance and if the public health, safety and general welfare will be served and substantial justice done. 
(2)  Special treatment of use variances. It is recognized that variances of the use regulations in the zoning ordinance present special problems not occurring in the case of variances of other types, and that the courts have carefully defined the scope of the board's powers with respect to use variances. Therefore, the board shall not grant any use variance under paragraph (1) above unless: 
a.  The zoning regulations allow no reasonable use to be made of the property in question for reasons peculiar to the property and not applicable to the area as a whole; 
b.  The use proposed is the minimum variance necessary in order to allow a reasonable use of the property; and 
c.  The use will not impair the essential character of the area or the objectives of the comprehensive plan of the City. 
(3)  Conditions. In granting any variance under paragraph (1) or (2) above, the Board may attach such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the neighborhood, such as, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Requirement of front, side or rear yards greater than the minimum required by this ordinance; 
b.  Requirement of screening of parking areas or other parts of the premises from adjoining premises or from the street, by walls, fences, planting, or other devices, as specified by the Board; 
c.  Modification of the exterior features or appearance of any structure, where necessary to preserve property values; 
d.  Limitation of size, number of occupants, method or time of operation, or extent of facilities; 
e.  Regulation of number, design, and location of access drives or other traffic features; 
f.  Requirement of off-street parking or other special features beyond the minimum required by this ordinance or other applicable codes or regulations. 
Failure to comply with any such condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 
(d)  Special exceptions-Statement of purpose. The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which the use of land and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or regulated in a particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of such uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for them at particular locations. Such uses and features are therefore treated as special exceptions. 
(1)  Where provided for elsewhere in this ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in appropriate cases, after public notice and hearing, grant special exceptions. 
(2)  Where an existing use or feature which is permitted only by special exception is proposed to be extended or substantially altered in a manner which would in any way change the character or intensity of the use or feature, such proposed extension or substantial alteration shall be treated as a special exception under this section. 
(3)  Special exceptions shall be granted only where the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that the proposed use or feature or the proposed extension or substantial alteration of an existing use or feature is in accord with the public convenience and welfare after taking into account, where appropriate: 
a.  The nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape and the proposed size, shape and arrangement of structures; 
b.  The resulting traffic patterns and adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading; 
c.  The nature of the surrounding area and the extent to which the proposed use or feature might impair its present and future development; 
d.  The proximity of dwellings, churches, schools, public buildings and other places of public gathering; 
e.  All standards contained in this ordinance; and 
f.  The comprehensive plan of the City of New Haven, and other expressions of the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
(4)  Time limits may be established by the Board of Zoning Appeals where appropriate. If a time limit is specified elsewhere in this ordinance, no special exception shall be granted for a time period longer than that specified; provided, however, that in any case, whenever the current period has more than half transpired a renewal of said special exception may be granted, up to the maximum period permitted by the terms of this ordinance, measured from the date of renewal, as often as the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that the foregoing standards continue to be met. 
(5)  In granting a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attached such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the neighborhood, such as, but not limited to, those listed in paragraph 63(c)(3) of this ordinance. Failure to comply with any such condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 
(6)  In the following types of special exception cases, which involve more than conventional questions of use and may have a significant impact on surrounding areas and a substantial relationship to the comprehensive plan of the city, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, following its hearing, refer the case including all exhibits to the City Plan Commission, which shall submit an advisory report, on such factors as it may deem relevant, to the board within 30 days after receiving all records and documents in the case. This report of the City Plan Commission shall be taken into account in the decision of the Board. 
a.  Limited expansion of institutions in RS-1 and RH-1 Districts: subsections 11(b)(2)b.; 15(b)(1). 
b.  Convenience stores in residence districts: section 31, as provided for in the district regulations. 
c.  Transition parking in residence districts: subsection 13(b)(3)c. and regulations of other residence districts. 
d.  Accessory retail space in RH-2 Districts: subsection 16(b)(3)c. 
e.  Accessory professional offices in RH-2 Districts: subsection 16(b)(3)d. 
f.  Adjustment for parking and loading requirements: subsections 29(c); 29(h)(2); 29(i); 45(a)(6)b,; 45(a)(7). 
g.  Adjustment of sign requirements: subsection 44(c). 
h.  Planned development units: subsection 65(d)(1). 
i.  A change from one nonconforming use to another that is different in nature and purpose: subsection 67(c)(3)a. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Notice and hearing; posting of notice of application. 
a.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing in the case of any application for review of an administrative order or for a variance or for a special exception. In addition to published notice, the board shall give notice of any such hearing at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing to the applicant filing the application, to the property owners whose property is located within and including a distance of 200 feet as measured from all boundaries of the property which is the subject of such appeal (if such property is within the city), and to the aldermen of the ward or wards in which the subject property and the properties within and including a distance of 200 feet are located, except that in cases of special exceptions involving areas of unusually large size, the board may give such reasonable notice as it may prescribe. 
b.  A sign of a design approved by the director of the Office of Building Inspection and Enforcement (OBIE) shall be posted by the applicant, not less than 14 days prior to the public hearing, on the property for which application is made, which sign shall be plainly readable from curbside of the addressed street frontage, and which sign shall contain language which provides, but is not limited to, the following information; the date of the hearing; notice that zoning relief has been applied for; an address and telephone number where further information can be obtained regarding the application; and the location of the hearing. Said sign may be obtained from the Office of Building Inspection and Enforcement (OBIE), and may be subject to a deposit not to exceed $50.00, which deposit may be redeemed by returning the sign not more than five working days following final disposition of the application. 
(2)  Other procedures. The Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe such rules and forms as it deems necessary for the filing of applications, postponement, time for exercise, extension of time, rehearing, and other matters.

f.  Filing fees. Each application for a review of an administrative order or for a variance or for a special exception shall be accompanied by such fee as may be stipulated by the Board of Aldermen from time to time in section 17-22 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of New Haven, payable to the Treasurer of the City or duly deputized agents, which shall be retained as a separate fund to be paid by the Treasurer to such person and in such amount as is designated by the Secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(3)  Neighborhood planning agency review. Upon receiving a request for a variance, special exception, appeal of an administrative order, planned development unit or district, or zone change the Board of Zoning Appeals, City Plan Commission and the Board of Aldermen, as applicable, may refer said request to any neighborhood planning agency (NPA) of jurisdiction if any exist 
An NPA may review such request and if it so chooses issue an advisory report to the referring agency prior to its final action on said request or indicate by letter to the referencing agency its decision not to issue a report on a reference item. Nothing in this NPA review shall be construed so as to delay the review process or to constrain the sound discretion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, City Plan Commission or Board of Aldermen. 
(f)  Reserved for future use. 
(g)  Waivers of prohibition against building on unaccepted streets. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and determine applications for waivers of the prohibition against building on unaccepted streets contained in Article VI of Chapter 27 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of New Haven as provided therein. In passing on any such applications, the board shall be strictly cognizant of the zoning ordinance, and may attach appropriate conditions and safeguards. Failure to comply within any such conditions or safeguards shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 
(h)  Lapse of approval; renewal; transferability; discontinuance, revocation. 
(1)  Lapse of approval. A special exception or variance is void one year after its effective date, except if otherwise specified by the board in its decision, unless: 
a.  The grant of relief has been recorded on the land records of the City of New Haven within 120 days of the date of publication of approval; and 
b.  A valid permit has been issued and construction diligently pursued; or 
c.  A Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) has been issued; or

Applications for renewal shall be made in writing between not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the lapse of the original approval. Upon timely application, a renewal may be granted after the expiration. An extension under this section shall be granted one time only and for a period of time of up to a maximum of one year.

(Ord. No. 1419, 6-5-06; Ord. No. 1766, 4-6-15) 
Section 64. - City Plan Commission. 
(a)  Continuous ordinance review. The City Plan Commission and its staff shall carry on a continuous review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the zoning ordinance, and recommend such changes as they see fit. 
(b)  Advice to other agencies. The City Plan Commission and its staff shall give such technical advice as they deem appropriate to the zoning enforcement officer, the Board of Zoning Appeals, and other agencies. 
(c)  Maintenance of zoning map. The City Plan Commission and its staff shall keep up to date the official zoning map, and shall keep the zoning enforcement officer and the City Clerk supplied with a current copy of such map. 
(d)  Amendment of the ordinance. 
(1)  Petitions for amendment of the text of the zoning ordinance or the zoning map shall be filed with the City Clerk for transmission to the Board of Aldermen, and shall thereafter be referred and acted upon by the City Plan Commission and the Board of Aldermen as provided in sections 183 and 184 of the New Haven Charter. All such petitions may also be referred to any Neighborhood Planning Agency (NPA) of jurisdiction as defined in section 1 of this Ordinance which may issue an advisory report on the proposed zoning amendment to the Board of Aldermen prior to final aldermanic action. Any such petition shall contain sufficient information, including maps where necessary, to indicate the exact change or changes which are sought. The zoning enforcement officer shall be kept informed by the City Clerk of pending petitions. 
(2)  In passing upon any such petition, the City Plan Commission shall take into account the various factors favoring and disfavoring a change, such as, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Errors in the existing ordinance, changes that have taken place in the city and in patterns of construction and land use, the supply of land and its peculiar suitability for various purposes, the effect of a map change on the surrounding area, the purposes of zoning and the comprehensive plan of the City of New Haven; 
b.  Whether some other method or procedure under the zoning ordinance is more appropriate; and 
c.  In the case of a map change, the size of the area involved. As a general policy, the City Plan Commission shall not consider favorably any petition which would result in a total contiguous area (separated only by streets, and excluding the area of streets) of less than two acres in the case of a residence district, less than one acre in the case of a Business District, or less than four acres in the case of an Industrial District. 
(e)  Special permits-Statement of purpose. The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which the use of land and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or regulated in a particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of such uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for them at particular locations. Such uses and features are therefore treated as special permits. 
(1)  Special permit defined. A land use permitted when the City Plan Commission finds that the standards for the use as contained within this Ordinance have been met. Only those uses designated as needing a special permit in section 42: Use Table and in Table 1: Permitted Uses in Residential Districts may be permitted by special permit. 
(2)  Finding required. Special permits shall be granted only where the City Plan Commission finds that the proposed use or feature or the proposed extension or substantial alteration of an existing use or feature is in accord with the public convenience and welfare after taking into account, where appropriate: 
a.  Burden of proof. A special permit shall not be considered an entitlement, and shall be granted by the Commission only after the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that all ordinance requirements are met. 
b.  Ordinance compliance. The proposed use shall comply with all applicable regulations, including any specific standards for the proposed use as set forth in this ordinance. Any accessory use to a special permit must receive express authorization from the commission. 
c.  Comprehensive Plan of Conservation and Development. The commission shall determine if the proposed special permit's use and improvements comply with the City's development plans. 
d.  Natural features. Special permits must preserve trees and other natural site features to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize their impact upon surrounding properties and the district, and must not have an adverse impact on significant scenic vistas or on significant wildlife or vegetation habitat. 
e.  Hazard protection. The proposed use shall not have a detrimental impact upon the use or peaceable enjoyment of abutting or nearby properties as a result of vibrations, fumes, odor, dust, erosion, sedimentation, flooding, fire, noise, glare, hazardous material use, storage, transportation or disposal, or similar conditions. 
f.  Historic preservation. Features of historic significance shall not be significantly adversely affected by the granting of any special permit. If the subject property is within or abuts a historic district, the Commission may request a report from the Historic District Commission regarding those features essential to preserve the historical integrity of a building, district, or site or historical significance. 
g.  Design and architectural compatibility. The operational and physical characteristics of the special permit shall be compatible with the surrounding area and the neighborhood in which it is proposed. Site design and architectural features which contribute to compatibility include, but are not limited to, landscaping, drainage, access and circulation, building style and height, bulk scale, setbacks, open areas, roof slopes, building orientation, overhangs, porches, ornamental features exterior materials and colors. 
h.  Property values. The use and site design shall not have a detrimental effect on the property values in the surrounding area. 
i.  Traffic impact. The applicant shall demonstrate how the proposed use will not adversely affect the safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation on, adjacent or nearby the site. The commission may require a traffic impact study be submitted to it by the applicant for any special permit use of land. The study shall consider traffic patterns and adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading resulting from the proposed development. 
(3)  Notice required. Public notice and hearing shall be furnished in accordance with the Connecticut General Statutes. 
(4)  Filing fee. Each application for a special permit shall be accompanied by such fee as may be stipulated by the Commission of Aldermen from time to time in Section 17-22 of the City of New Haven Code of Ordinances. 
(f)  Site plan standards and procedures: 
(1)  Purpose. A site plan application is required to aid the City in determining the conformity of a proposed building, use, or structure with specific provisions of the Zoning Ordinance as adopted by the Board of Aldermen. 
(2)  Applicability. Site plan approval shall be required for the following:

An application, fee and plans shall be filed in the City Plan Department and Staff shall report all such approvals to the Commission at its next meeting. 
g.  City Plan Department staff may determine that a proposed site plan does not meet threshold requirements of site plan review and may therefore be approved administratively, without formal Commission review. See Section 64(f)(10).

(10)  Administrative site plan review. For proposed activities which do not meet the threshold for site plan review by the City Plan Commission as contained in section 64(f)(2) of this Ordinance, but still require a building permit and/or staff level zoning review, an administrative site plan review by the City of New Haven is required. Prior to commencement of any site activity, including but not limited to clearing and grubbing, grading, footings and/or foundations work, the applicant shall submit a site plan for review and approval consistent with guidelines approved by the City Plan Commission.

In passing upon any such application, the Commission shall be strictly cognizant of the provisions of the zoning ordinance, and may appropriate conditions and safeguards. Failure to comply with any such condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 
(h)  Duration of approval, lapse of approval, renewal, transferability, and revocation. 
(1)  Duration of approval. Pursuant to Section 8-3(i) of the Connecticut General Statutes, any site plan approved after June 30, 2011 is valid for a period of five years after the date of decision. Upon petition of the applicant, the Commission may, at its discretion, grant extensions totaling no more than an additional five years to complete all work connected to the original approval. Pursuant to Section 8-3(m) of the Connecticut General Statutes, any site plan approved prior to July 1, 2011 and that has not already expired prior to May 9, 2011 is valid for a period of nine years after the date of decision. Upon petition of the applicant, the Commission may, at its discretion, grant extensions totaling no more than an additional five years to complete all work connected to the original approval. Applications for extensions shall be made in writing between not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the lapse of the original approval. 
(2)  Lapse of approval. Consistent with Section 62.D, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall determine the status of an approval and make a determination if the approval is valid or if approval has lapsed. 
(3)  Transferability. The validity of an approval shall not be affected by changes in ownership.

Section 65. - Planned developments. 
(a)  Objectives. The provisions of this section are to be applied in instances where tracts of land of considerable size are developed, redeveloped or renewed as integrated and harmonious units, and where the overall design of such units is so outstanding as to warrant modification of the standards contained elsewhere in this ordinance. A planned development, to be eligible under this section, must be: 
(1)  In accordance with the comprehensive plans of the city, including all plans for redevelopment and renewal; 
(2)  Composed of such uses, and in such proportions, as are most appropriate and necessary for the integrated functioning of the planned development and for the city; 
(3)  So designed in its space allocation, orientation, texture, materials, landscaping and other features as to produce an environment of stable and desirable character, complementing the design and values of the surrounding neighborhood, and showing such unusual merit as to reflect credit upon the developer and upon the city; and 
(4)  So arranged as to provide a minimum of 250 square feet of usable open space per dwelling unit on the tract, except 125 square feet in the case of elderly housing units, subject to the specific minimum standards enumerated in section 15(a)(1)g. of this ordinance. 
(b)  Tract. The tract for which application is made must have the following minimum and maximum areas: 
(1)  For a Planned Development Unit under paragraph (d)(1) below, between one-half and two acres in the case of dwellings only, and between one and two acres in all other cases. 
(2)  For a Planned Development District under paragraph (d)(2) below, over one acre in the case of dwellings only, and over two acres in all other cases. 
(c)  Who may apply. An application may be filed by (1) the owner or owners or lessee or lessees of all land and structures included within the tract, or (2) any governmental agency including the New Haven Redevelopment Agency. The holder of a written option or contract to purchase or lease land and/or structures shall, for purposes of such Application, be deemed the owner or lessee of the land and/or structures covered by such option or contract. 
(d)  Application and general plans. Each application shall state the proposed modifications of existing zoning, and shall be accompanied by general plans, including contoured site plans. The general plans shall show the improvements to be erected upon the tract, the open spaces to be provided, the nature and location of the proposed use or uses, the relationship of the proposed development to surrounding properties, and other pertinent information. 
Traffic impact study. All applications filed pursuant to this section shall be referred to the Department of Traffic and Parking for an advisory report on the traffic impact. The traffic impact study shall show the amount and direction of traffic to be generated by the proposed development and shall estimate the effect of such traffic on the roadway capacity and safety. 
The Application and General Plans shall be sufficient in scope and character to determine that the objectives stated in subsection (a) above will be met. Any proposed division of the tract into separately owned and operated units shall be indicated. The Application and General Plans shall be filed and acted upon in the following manner: 
(1)  Where the proposed modifications of existing zoning concern only the bulk and placement of structures and the size and shape of lots (regulation of lot area, average lot width, distance between buildings, size of courts, yards, gross floor area, building height, and/or building coverage ), or involve a reduction of lot area per dwelling unit of no more than 33%, such Application and General Plans shall be filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals and acted upon as a special exception under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance. If such Application and General Plans are approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, upon specific findings that each of the objectives stated in subsection (a) above will be met, such approval shall be construed to modify provisions contained elsewhere in this ordinance insofar (and only insofar) as specific deletions, additions and changes are made which are related to land and structures in the tract, and the tract shall be designated a Planned Development Unit within the existing zoning district, provided that the requirements of subsection (e) below are met. 
(2)  In any other case, the Application and General Plans shall be filed with the Board of Aldermen and acted upon as a proposed amendment to this ordinance. If such application and General Plans are approved by the Board of Aldermen, following a favorable recommendation by the City Plan Commission and after an advisory report from the Department of Traffic and Parking regarding the traffic impact study, upon specific findings that each of the objectives stated in subsection 65(a) above will be met, such approval shall be construed to amend this ordinance insofar (and only insofar) as specific deletions, additions and changes are made which are related to the land and structures in the tract, and the tract shall be designated as a separate Planned Development District provided that the requirements of subsection 65(e) below are met. 
(3)  All applications filed under this section may be referred by the Board of Zoning Appeals in the case of Planned Development Units, and by the Board of Aldermen in the case of Planned Development Districts, to any Neighborhood Planning Agency (NPA) of jurisdiction as defined in section 1 of this ordinance, which may issue an advisory report on the proposed zoning designation to the Board of Zoning Appeals or Board of Aldermen, as appropriate, prior to final action by these boards. Nothing in the npa review shall be construed so as to delay the review process or to constrain the sound discretion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, City Plan Commission or Board of Aldermen. 
(e)  Subsequent performance. All official zoning maps shall carry a notation of the location and boundaries of any planned development approved as above, giving a reference to a file in which full information concerning the provisions applying to the same may be found. 
(1)  After the approval of the Application and General Plans, the applicant shall file detailed plans for review by the City Plan Commission, showing the details of the proposed development as fully as possible and including elevations and perspectives of proposed construction. If the applicant later wishes to change any of the details of the proposed development, further detailed plans shall be filed for review by the City Plan Commission. No building permit for the proposed development or any part thereof shall be issued until the City Plan Commission has determined that the pertinent Detailed Plans are in accordance with the Application and General Plans as approved and with the objectives stated in subsection (a) above. If any Detailed Plans are not acted upon by the City Plan Commission within 60 days after they are submitted to it, they shall be deemed to be approved. 
(2)  Within three months after the approval of the Application and General Plans, a certified copy of such Application and General Plans shall be filed by the applicant at their own expense in the office of the city/town clerk. 
(3)  If construction of improvements is not begun and diligently prosecuted to completion within a reasonable time established by the City Plan Commission at the time of approval of detailed plans, and if an extension of time is not given by the City Plan Commission for good cause shown, then the modifications or amendments of this ordinance provided for in subsection 65(d) above shall become null and void, and the tract shall revert to all the requirements of its previous zoning. No certificate of occupancy (C of O) shall be issued until a detailed report is submitted by the applicant to the City Plan Commission showing the outcome of construction and the City Plan Commission certifies that all the requirements of this section 65 relating to planned developments have been met. 
(4)  Parking Plan amendments to a planned development. Any amendment of 20 or more parking spaces to an Overall Parking Plan which covers an area including a planned development must be submitted for approval to the body that approved the original planned development: the Board of Alderman for a PDD; the Board of Zoning Appeals for a PDU. If an Overall Parking Plan covers an area that includes both a PDD and PDU, then changes shall be submitted to the Board of Aldermen for review and approval, provided, however, that the Board of Aldermen may elect to refer such amendment to the Board of Zoning Appeals for action. If an Overall Parking Plan covers an area of 150 or more acres, then (a) changes involving 100 or more parking spaces shall be submitted for review and approval to the Board of Aldermen, and (b) changes of less than 100 spaces shall be submitted for administrative review by the City Plan Department. Any request to change the borders of the area covered by an Overall Parking Plan must be submitted to the Board of Aldermen for review and approval, provided however that no parking plan shall cover two or more non-contiguous areas, excepting satellite lots that may service the primary area. Increased parking demand generated by employees working on temporary construction projects shall not require an application to amend an Overall Parking Plan, but shall be included in the application for city approval of the project. The proposed parking plan amendment shall include an account of all available parking and its use; an account of all parking fees charged and revenues collected; an account of current demand management efforts such as public transit subsidies, car pools, bicycle storage, satellite parking lots with shuttle service and others; a census of potential parkers, per section 12(b), with five-year and ten-year projections based on the applicant's expansion plans, if any; a detailed study of the utilization of on-street parking in the surrounding area; and such other information as the Board of Aldermen deems necessary. Any Overall Parking Plan that is or becomes out of compliance with conditions required by a city board or commission shall be updated and submitted for review/approval within 30 days of the effective date of this ordinance or within 30 days of the date of non-compliance. 
A current Overall Parking Plan must have been approved pursuant to this Section (unless such OPP is comprised only of a PDU and does not contain a PDD), notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance to the contrary, and notwithstanding any Overall Parking Plan approved prior to the effective date of this section, prior to the approval of any new application proposing zoning map amendments, zoning regulation amendments, Variances, Special Exceptions, Special Permits, or Site Plan review for any project within the City of New Haven which is submitted by an entity which is subject to an Overall Parking Plan. 
(Ord. No. 1358, §§ 1, 2, 9-7-04; Ord. No. 1788, 1-19-16) 
Section 66. - Deviations prohibited. 
(a)  No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in conformity with all the terms of this ordinance. (For nonconforming uses, structures and lots, see section 67.) 
(b)  No reduction of lot area, lot area per dwelling unit, lot area per sleeping room, lot area per square foot of gross floor area, lot area per square foot of building coverage, average lot width, yards, usable open space, parking, loading, or any other requirement of this ordinance, shall be made by subdivision, conveyance, alienation or any other means. 
(c)  No part of the required lot area, lot area per dwelling unit, lot area per sleeping room, area per square foot of gross floor area, lot area per square foot of building coverage, average lot width, yards, usable open space, parking, loading, or any other requirements of this ordinance, used for or credited to one lot, shall be used for or credited to any other lot, except that joint use may be made of parking and loading within the provisions of sections 29(h) and 45(a)(6). 
Section 67. - Nonconforming uses, structures and lots. 
(a)  Statement of purpose. 
(1)  A nonconforming use , structure or lot is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or otherwise, on the date this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment thereto became effective, and which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable regulations in the Zoning Ordinance or such amendment thereto. 
(2)  Such nonconformities are incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses , structures, and lots in the zoning districts in which they are located; they cause disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the city; they inhibit present and future development of nearby properties; and they confer upon their owners and users a position of unfair advantage. 
(3)  It is a fundamental principal of zoning law that nonconformities are not to be expanded, and that they should be abolished or reduced to conformity as quickly as the fair interests of the parties will permit. This principle is declared to be the intent of this ordinance. 
(4)  It is the further intent of this ordinance that existing nonconformities shall not cause further departures from the Zoning Ordinance, and therefore the existence of any present nonconformity anywhere in the city shall not in itself be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance for any other property. 
(b)  General provisions. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, a nonconforming use , structure or lot as defined by subsection 67(a) above may be continued, except as otherwise specified in this section 67. 
(2)  No nonconformity shall be deemed to have existed on the date this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment thereto became effective, unless: 
a.  It was in being on a continuous basis and to its fullest extent on such date; and 
b.  If such nonconformity is a use , such use had not been abandoned within the meaning of section 67(c)(6). 
Provided that, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun in good faith prior to such date, provided such construction is diligently prosecuted to completion within two years following such date. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials so that they are in a permanent position and fastened to the earth in a permanent manner. 
(3)  In order to assure that the fair interests of the parties will be protected, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require discontinuance of a nonconformity because of mere changes of title or possession or right of possession of property, except in the case of nonconforming lots under section 67(e)(1). 
(c)  Nonconforminguses. 
(1)  No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, extended or altered, and no structure or part thereof devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except in changing the use to one which is permitted in the district in which such use is located. No nonconforming use of a structure shall be extended to occupy land outside such structure or space in another structure. 
(2)  No nonconforming use of land shall be moved to another part of a lot or outside the lot , and no nonconforming use of a structure shall be moved to any part of the structure not manifestly arranged and designed for such use at the time the use became nonconforming, and no structure containing a nonconforming use shall be moved, unless the result of any moving described in this paragraph (2) is to end the nonconforming use . 
(3)  Change of use . 
a.  No nonconforming use of land or of a structure shall be changed to any use which is substantially different in nature and purpose from the former nonconforming use , except such uses as are permitted in the district in which they are located, unless a special exception is granted under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance, upon a finding, among other things, that the new use will have a lesser impact upon the surrounding area than the old one. 
b.  Where any change is proposed to be made to a use that is permitted in the district only by special exception, such change may be made only through a special exception granted under subsection 63(d) of this ordinance. 
c.  When a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use , it shall not thereafter be changed to any use not permitted in the district in which the use is located. 
d.  When a nonconforming use has been wrongfully changed to any use which is substantially different in nature and purpose from the former nonconforming use , such change shall be deemed to constitute abandonment of the former nonconforming use under subparagraph 67(c)(6)b. of this ordinance. 
(4)  In order to assure that structures containing nonconforming uses will be maintained in safe and decent condition for so long as such nonconforming uses continue, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prohibit: 
a.  Work in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs and replacement of existing materials with similar materials placed in the same manner, to an extent not exceeding 20% of the current replacement value of the structure (excluding the value of land, the cost of preparation of land and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use ) as determined by the zoning enforcement officer (ZEO); or 
b.  Any work required by the codes and ordinances of the city or ordered by any city official charged with protecting the public health, safety or welfare, if such work does not enlarge or extend a nonconforming use or otherwise increase any nonconformity. 
(5)  In order to assure that the fair interests of the parties will be protected, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prohibit the restoration of any structure and its use where such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent of 50% or less of its replacement value (excluding the value of land, the cost of preparation of land and the value of any foundation adaptable to the conforming use ) at the time of destruction, provided the restoration of such structure and its use in no way increases any former nonconformity, and provided further that restoration of such structure is begun within one year of such destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion within two years following such destruction. But whenever such a structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement value (excluding the value of land, the cost of preparation of land and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use ) at the time of destruction, as determined by the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO), or by any means within the control of the owner (except as provided in paragraph 67(c)(4) to any extent whatsoever, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with all the regulations of the district in which such structure is located, including regulations as to use . 
(6)  Abandonment of nonconforming uses : 
a.  Any nonconforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be re-established. Any structure or land, or structure and land in combination, which was formerly devoted to a nonconforming use which has been abandoned, shall not again be devoted to any use other than those uses which are permitted in the district in which the structure or land, or structure and land in combination, is located. 
b.  The term abandonment, as used therein, shall mean the voluntary discontinuance of a use , when accompanied by an intent not to re-establish such use . Any one of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon: 
1.  Any positive act indicating such intent; or 
2.  Any conscious failure to take all necessary steps to resume the nonconforming use with reasonable dispatch in the circumstances, including advertising of the property for sale or for lease; or 
3.  In the case of a structure or of a structure and land in combination, discontinuance of the nonconforming use for nine consecutive months, or for a total of 18 months during any three-year period; or 
4.  In the case of land only, discontinuance of the nonconforming use for 90 consecutive days, or for a total of six months during any one-year period. 
(7)  In any residence district, uses of land only, and outdoor uses whether of all or part of a lot , which are nonconforming at the date this section 67 becomes effective or becomes nonconforming at any future date, shall either be made to conform to the regulations of the district in which they are located, or be discontinued and removed within three years from the date this section 67 becomes effective or from the date they become non-conforming, whichever date is later. Under this paragraph (7) shall be included junk yards , storage yards, outdoor sales areas, quarries, and other such uses , where the principal activities on the lot are not carried on within a structure or are carried on within a structure which is adaptable to a conforming use , or where the outdoor use is independent of or unnecessary to activities carried on within any structure on the lot . 
(8)  Advertising signs located in residence districts, other than on a property devoted also to some other business or industrial use , shall be discontinued and removed within three years from the date this section 67 becomes effective or from the date they become non-conforming or from the date such other business or industrial use is discontinued, whichever date is latest. 
(9)  A nonconforming use carried on within a structure may have business signs, if such signs are of the belt type, non-flashing and non-rotating, not located above the ground floor, and of a size not exceeding 10% of the area of ground floor wall surface on which such signs are located, including window and door area. 
(10)  No use shall be deemed a nonconforming use if located within a district in which a special exception may be granted for such a use under this ordinance. Subsection 63(d) shall govern as to the expansion or substantial alteration of such uses , as well as section 31 in the case of convenience goods and services in residence districts. 
(11)  Lack of required lot area per dwelling unit , parking, loading, or yards , and excessive building bulk or coverage, shall not in themselves be deemed nonconforming uses under this subsection 67(c); such nonconformities are governed by subsection 67(d). However, lack of required screening or other safeguards, improper use of outdoor areas, excessive area occupied by a use , improper arrangement of parking, loading or driveways, and similar deviations shall be deemed nonconforming uses under this subsection 67(c). 
(12)  All nonconforming uses shall be subject to the same regulations for arrangement and operation as those that would apply if they were conforming uses , unless such regulations conflict with other applicable regulations. (See especially section 46 concerning outdoor areas, and 48 concerning performance standards.) 
(d)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Structures failing to meet any requirement of this ordinance other than use , including lack of required parking or loading, shall not be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed or altered, if the result would be an increase in nonconformity. See also Sections 66, 29(j), and 45(a)(8) of this ordinance. 
(2)  Signs of a size or type not permitted in the district in which they are situated, or which are improperly located or illuminated, or nonconforming in any other way, shall be considered nonconforming structures under this subsection 67(d), and any increasing in size, illumination or flashing of such signs shall be deemed to be an enlargement or extension producing an increase in nonconformity. 
(3)  No structure described in paragraph 67(d)(1) or paragraph 67(d)(2) above shall be moved unless the result of such moving is to reduce or eliminate its nonconformity. 
(e)  Nonconforming lots. . 
(1)  If two or more adjoining lots of record, one or both of which fail to meet the requirements of this ordinance with regard to lot area and/or average lot width, have continuous frontage and are in single ownership at any time after the application of the provisions of this ordinance to such lots , and if such lots taken together would form one or more lots , each meeting the requirements of this ordinance with regard to lot area and average lot width, such lot or lots shall no longer be considered nonconforming, and must be use d in compliance with the lot area and average lot width requirements irrespective of subsequent changes in ownership. 
(2)  If a lot which is of record at the time of the application of the provisions of this ordinance to such lot is insufficient as to lot area or average lot width, a single-family dwelling may be constructed on such lot regardless of the requirements of this ordinance with regard to lot area and average lot width, but conforming to all other regulations of the district in which such lot is located. Any other provision of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, in any case where a variance is sought for construction on such a lot other than as allowed in this paragraph 67(e)(2), no variance shall be granted for a structure of a size or shape not allowed on the lot under the zoning regulations pertaining to the lot at the time the lot was reduced to its present dimensions. 
Section 68. - Separability. 
    It is hereby declared to be legislative intent that: 
(a)  If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provisions of this ordinance to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to those provisions which are expressly stated in the decision to be invalid or ineffective, and all the other provisions of this ordinance shall continue to be separately and fully effective. 
(b)  If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the application of any provision or provisions of this ordinance to any lot, building or other structure , or tract of land to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to the person, property, or situation immediately involved in the controversy, and the application of any such provision to other persons, property, or situations shall not be affected. 
Section 69. - Effect on other requirements. 
    The previous provisions of the New Haven Zoning Ordinance are repealed as of the effective date of this revision. It is not intended that the requirements of any other law or ordinance be repealed or otherwise made ineffective by this ordinance, and in case of conflict the strictest of the relevant provisions of this and other laws and ordinances shall apply. 
Section 70. - Effective date. 
    The effective date of this revision shall be June 5, 1995.
