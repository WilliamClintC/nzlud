repealed chapters, sections, and subsections, or any part thereof, by
subsequent ordinances, the repealed portions may be excluded from the code by
the omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent

ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a
new code of ordinances by the Board of Trustees.



§ 10.10  SEVERABILITY.



   If any provisions of a section of these codified ordinances or the

   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any

references shall also include the designee or agent of any such officer or
office, unless the law or the context clearly requires otherwise.



§ 10.12  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.



   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
word or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the
intention of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no
meaning can be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or
words was clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be
corrected, and the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will
conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same
effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as originally

within the 45-day period, the tax termination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.



   (E)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the
full payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of
the due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall

still due and owing.



   (B)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than

§ 35.027  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty
for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the
taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amount owed
as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amounts owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk’s office.

procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.



   (B)   Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the
lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is
determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:



      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the village’s expense;



      (2)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and

receiving in the village intrastate telecommunications by a person at the
rate of 5% of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at

municipalities in this state.



      (2)   The act or privilege of originating in the village or
receiving in the village interstate telecommunications by a person at the

such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to
this subsection to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid

manner as the original charge for the taxable services. If the retailer fails
to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to
pay the tax directly to the village.

shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from
the gross charge for telecommunications.

service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended,

of sending or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax- free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the village and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to the
person is nontaxable because of being for resale.



   (E)   Returns, filing, contents, payment of tax.

his or her total billings of business subject to the tax during the period
for which the return is made (exclusive of any amounts previously billed)
with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon any differences between
the billings and the taxable gross charges.



   (G)   Erroneous payment.  If it shall appear that an amount of tax
has been paid which was not due under the provisions of this section, whether
as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then the amount shall
be credited against any tax due, or to become due, under this section from
the taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided, that no amounts
erroneously paid more than three years prior to the filing of a claim
therefor shall be so credited.

video games, and game systems within the corporate limits of La Grange Park,
at the rate of 3% of the gross receipts collected therefrom after the

indicates or requires a different meaning.

upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $500 nor more than
$1,000, and in addition, shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of

upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the affect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH is
determined from periodic grab samples.

thereof sounds an audible signal by bell, siren or exhaust whistle, as may be

triple eight moving white beam light other than a Fire Department vehicle.
However, this provision does not relieve the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of
all persons using the street, nor does it protect the driver of any such
vehicle from the consequences of a reckless disregard of the safety of others.

§ 77.01  THE PROGRAM.



   A program of vehicle immobilization shall be instituted and implemented
through the office of the Chief of Police, whereby eligible vehicles shall be
immobilized by the placement of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent
their operation.  A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization under the
following criteria:



   (A)   The registered owner of a vehicle has accumulated five or more
final determinations of parking, standing, compliance or automated traffic
violation liability as determined under the relevant provisions of §§70.051
through 70.057 (vehicle license), § 70.097(C) (compliance), and §§ 72.01
through 72.99 (parking) of the LaGrange Park Municipal Code, for which the
fees and/or penalties remain unpaid.



   (B)   The person determined to be liable for five or more unpaid
violations described in division (A) above is the registered owner of a motor
vehicle located within the village’s geographical boundaries.



   (C)   The registered owner of said motor vehicle has received a
notice of impending vehicle immobilization under the procedures listed in §
77.02.



(Ord. 879, passed 8-26-08)



§ 77.02  NOTICE OF IMPENDING VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION.



   Written notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to the registered owner of the motor vehicle, at the address to
which the motor vehicle is registered, at least 21 days prior to placing the
registration plate number on the vehicle immobilization eligibility list. 
Notice shall be sent as follows:



   (A)   The address of the registered owner shall be determined from
the records of the Illinois Secretary of State, or in the case of a vehicle
bearing a registration number of a state other than Illinois, from the
records of that state’s registry of motor vehicles;



   (B)   The notice shall state the name and address of the registered
owner, the state registration number of the motor vehicle, the nature of the
ordinance violations, citation numbers and dates of the final determinations
of liability referred to in § 77.01(A) above; and



   (C)   The notice shall advise that a person may challenge the
validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by utilizing the
procedure set forth in § 77.03 below.



(Ord. 879, passed 8-26-08)



§ 77.03  CHALLENGING VALIDITY OF IMPENDING VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION.



   A challenge of the validity of the notice of impending vehicle for
immobilization must be made in person to the Village Manager or his/her
designee no later than 21 days after issuance of written notice pursuant to
§ 77.02.  Such a request shall set forth specific facts to conclusively
establish that the vehicle owner is not liable for the outstanding
violations, such as:



   (A)   The person was not the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle on
the date or dates the complaints were issued; or



   (B)   The fines or penalties for the violations cited have been
paid; or



   (C)   The registered owner has not accumulated five or more final
determinations of parking, standing, compliance or automated traffic
violations which are unpaid, or that the final determinations were not
adjudicated properly.



(Ord. 879, passed 8-26-08)



§ 77.04 IMMOBILIZATION OF VEHICLE; POST-IMMOBILIZATION NOTICE.



   Unless the Village Manager or his/her designee determines that the
motor vehicle is not eligible for immobilization, pursuant to § 77.03,
within the 21-day period, the state registration number of the vehicle shall
be placed on the vehicle immobilization list and immobilization shall proceed
as follows:



   (A)   An immobilization device shall be installed on the vehicle by
the Police Department or its designee;



   (B)   A notice shall be placed in a conspicuous place on the motor
vehicle warning that any attempt to move the vehicle while the immobilization
device is attached may result in damage to the vehicle;



   (C)   The notice shall inform the registered owner of the
immobilized vehicle that he or she or his/her authorized agent may, within 24
hours of the date on which the vehicle was immobilized:



      (1)   Pay all fees for immobilization and penalties due on the
outstanding violations listed in the notice of eligibility for
immobilization, or pay a deposit prior to a hearing as provided in §
77.04(C)(3) below; or



      (2)   Present copies of the appearances filed with the Circuit
Court Clerk of Cook County on all outstanding complaints specified in the
notice of eligibility for immobilization; or



      (3)   Deposit cash collateral in the amount of the fines and
penalties for all outstanding violations listed in the notice of eligibility
for immobilization and execute an agreement to present copies of appearances
filed with the Circuit Court Clerk of Cook County on all outstanding final
determinations specified in the notice of eligibility for immobilization
within 21 days from the date of the agreement.  Such collateral shall be
returned after the court cases have been concluded, but shall be forfeited if
the owner does not appear in court.  The forfeited collateral may not be
used to satisfy any unpaid fees or penalties.  Upon forfeiture of
collateral, the motor vehicle shall again be subject to immediate
immobilization and no further deposit of collateral as described in this
subsection shall again be allowed as a method of release; and



   (D)   The notice shall warn the registered owner of the immobilized
vehicle that it will be towed and impounded if release is not obtained under
this section within 24 hours after the vehicle has been immobilized and that
the costs of immobilization, towing and storage fees must be paid in addition
to the penalties due on the outstanding complaints listed on the notice of
eligibility for immobilization.



(Ord. 879, passed 8-26-08)



§ 77.05  NOTICE OF IMPOUNDMENT.



   Within 15 days after a vehicle has been towed and impounded, notice of
impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by
first class mail, postage prepaid to the owner of the motor vehicle at the
address to which the motor vehicle is registered.  The notice shall state
the owner has a right to a hearing as specified in challenging the validity
of the vehicle immobilization under § 77.03. The failure of the owner of any
impounded vehicle to claim the vehicle or to request a hearing within 30 days
of the mailing of the notice of impoundment shall result in the impounded
vehicle being disposed of in accordance with the laws of the State of
Illinois pertaining to abandoned/unclaimed vehicles.



(Ord. 879, passed 8-26-08)



§ 77.06  IMMOBILIZATION FEES.



   The fee for vehicle immobilization shall be $50. If the vehicle is
towed, the registered owner shall be responsible for the payment of all
towing and storage fees charged by the towing service provider.  No fees
shall be assessed in any instance where it is determined by the Village
Manager or his/her designee after a hearing that the immobilization and/or
towing was in error.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 98.001  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies
and procedures for constructing on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the
village rights-of-way and the village as a whole.



   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to
exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in
particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:



      (l)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks,
alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;



      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions
and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;



      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations
of the village's utilities and of other  lawfully located in rights-of-way
or public property;



      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage
to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;



      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to
structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;



      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which
facilities are installed;



      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined
parkways characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;



      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of
facilities in the rights-of-way; and



      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private
properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.



   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to
all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the  date of this chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.



   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in
its discretion and as limited by law, may require to enter into a franchise,
license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such
an agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent
with this chapter.



   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.



      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In
the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any
conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the
village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such
franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the
term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all
chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of such conflict.



   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that
applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or
state laws or regulations.



   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound
engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the
standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the
village so  determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the
ability of the village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of
the public health, safety and welfare.

§ 98.005  ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit
applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances,

reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the
Director of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor
as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public
Works, that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.



   (B)   Additional village review of applications of
telecommunications retailers.



      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS
Ch. 220, Act 65, § 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days
prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation.  The Director of
Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.



      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either ten days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit
under this chapter.



      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to § 98.004 the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an application for a
permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject
to the requirements of division (A) of this section.



   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village,
provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances,
and regulations.



(Ord. 862, passed 12-11-07; Ord. 1092, passed 7-24-18)



§ 98.006  EFFECT OF PERMIT.



   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest
created.  A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only
certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the
rights-of-way.



   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid
for a period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.



   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village
with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under
the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where
work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other
utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid
disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.



   (D)   Compliance with all laws required.  The issuance of a permit
by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules,
and regulations.



(Ord. 862, passed 12-11-07; Ord. 1092, passed 7-24-18)



§ 98.007  REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate
from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit
also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with § 98.021.  If the village denies
the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the
facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to
the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.



(Ord. 862, passed 12-11-07; Ord. 1092, passed 7-24-18)

the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and
employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions
(A)(1)(a) and (b) below:



         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including

            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or
death to each person;



            2.   Five million dollars for property damage

   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies.  The coverages required by this
section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies.
Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying

primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or
umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.



   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of
the policies required by this section to the village within ten days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the village.



   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.

canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."



      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said
notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the
utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.



   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of
this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of
such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under division (A) of this section, or the requirements
of division (B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to
self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate
its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required under division (A) of this section, such as evidence
that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation
Act.



   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's
liability.  The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or
self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such
insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts
thereunder.



   (G)   Insurance companies.  All insurance provided pursuant to this
section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. 
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or
better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

§ 98.009  INDEMNIFICATION.



   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from

affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or

regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and



      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including,
without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from
the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.



   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the
village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the village and the permittee;



      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and



      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and
within the state at which it can be drawn.



   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works,
and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village
estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such
restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each
phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which
shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
division for any single phase.



   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the 14 day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:



      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or



      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that
the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.



   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice
from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund,
the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
division (C) of this section.



   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by
the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the
minimum balance required in division (C) of this section.



   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a
result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with
respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the
village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund
shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery
with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise
violated.

ordinances, rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to
the work and facilities in the right-of-way.



   (B)   Amended permit.  A new owner shall request that any current
permit be amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a
new or amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to
have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
permit if the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the
village's right-of-way.



   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or
bonding must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.



(Ord. 862, passed 12-11-07; Ord. 1092, passed 7-24-18)



§ 98.013  GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.



   (A)   Standards and principles. All construction in the right-of-way
shall be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and
regulations, and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and
construction principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable,
the principles and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications, as

any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the village.



(Ord. 862, passed 12-11-07; Ord. 1092, passed 7-24-18)



§ 98.015  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   (A)   General requirements.  In addition to location requirements
applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities,
regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of
this division.



      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility
facilities shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works
determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
displacement of any of the village's utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the village's utility
facilities.



      (2)   Minimum interference and impact.  The proposed location
shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the
right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners
who adjoin said right-of-way.



      (3)   No interference with travel.  No utility facility shall
be placed in any location that interferes with the usual travel on such
right-of-way.



      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall
be placed in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the
right-of-way.



      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation
shall use the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power
pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of
location, for the particular application.



   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.



      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:



         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the
right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as
reasonable pole alignment will permit;



         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as
practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind
the face of the curb, where available;



         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote
from pavement edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m)
outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear
zone;



         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway;
and



         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within
one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the
right-of-way line.



      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:



         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way
line as practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to
the right-of-way line;



         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved
portion of a highway only if other locations are impracticable or
inconsistent with sound engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be
installed in existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and



         (c)   In the case of an underground power or
communications line, the facility shall be located as near the right-of-way
line as practicable and not more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way
line and any above-grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable.



   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.



      (1)   No future disruption.  The construction and design of
crossing facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of
village highways may require the incorporation of materials and protections
(such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future
repairs to the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing
facilities.



      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. 
Crossing facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or
drainage facilities.



      (3)   90 degree crossing required.  Crossing facilities shall
cross at or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.



      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility.  An overhead
power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:



         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as
required by ICC's rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and
Communication Lines" (83 Ill. Adm. Code 305);



         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and



         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are
avoided.



      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An
underground power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:



         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will
provide maximum maintenance-free service life; and



         (b)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future
expansion needs is provided in the initial installation.



      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide
a marker at each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a
power or communication facility crosses a highway.  Each marker shall
identify the type of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number.
Markers may also be eliminated as provided in current federal regulations.
(49 C.F.R. § 192.707 (1989)).



   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. 
The village may require that facilities be located within particular
rights-of-way that are not highways, rather than within particular highways.



   (E)   Freestanding facilities.



      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way.



      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility
located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.



   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may
be installed only if:



      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located
underground;



      (2)   New underground installation is not technically
feasible; and



      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location,
and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest
protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without
adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to,
self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration
of conductors and cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is
strongly discouraged.



   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.



      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or
roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other
means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall
include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles,
cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from
the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are
volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.



      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a
facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data
demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:



         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the
commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to
persons and property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;



         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance
of the highway structure in the transportation system;



         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility
and their comparative practicability;



         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;



         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased
load of the proposed facility;



         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance
and painting;



         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure;
and



         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility
service as compared to the risk involved.



   (H)   Appearance standards.



      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities
in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.



      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction
does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features
visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property
owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being
traversed.

§ 98.016  CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.



   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of
construction methods.



      (1)   Boring or jacking.



         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under
rights-of-way shall be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance
specified by the Director of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits
for boring or jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of
boring or jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or
jacking operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly
marked and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected,
supported, braced, and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical
and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking
operation.



         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall
not be permitted under the roadway.



         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. 
Borings over six inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an
auger and following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the
outside diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).



         (d)   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings
of six inches or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking,
guided with auger, or auger and following pipe method.



         (e)   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the
drip line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved or protected
shall be bored under or around the root system.



      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair,
or maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of Section 603 of IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction."



         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to
the practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing.
Only one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless
special permission is obtained from the Director of Public Works.



         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench
and windrowed excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6
of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable,
the excavated material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench
as added protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the
paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for
windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated
material shall be hauled to an off-road location.



         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench
within the drip line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.



      (3)   Backfilling.



         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the
installation of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and
length using methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.  When excavated material is
hauled away or is unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall
be used.



         (b)   For a period of three years from the date
construction of a facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to
remove and restore any backfilled area that has settled due to construction
of the facility. If so ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility,
at its expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of
the installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as
determined by the Director of Public Works.



      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation
or repair shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway
is closed to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this
subdivision is permitted under § 98.21, the following requirements shall
apply:



         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled
and compacted as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10
gradation, as designated by the Director of Public Works.



         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be
accomplished as soon as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous
mixture shall be provided immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the
temporary repair or the restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the
village.



         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.



         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been
reconstructed with a concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or
resurfaced in the last three years, permits shall not be issued unless such
work is determined to be an emergency repair or other work considered
necessary and unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or unless a
pavement cut is necessary for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.



      (5)   Encasement.



         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the
load of the highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be
continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed
installation approved by the village.



         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall
extend within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent
pipes shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that
particular section of the highway.



         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing,
encasement shall be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or
village approved jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be
omitted only if pipe is installed prior to highway construction and carrier
pipe is continuous or mechanical joints are of a type approved by the
village. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of
installation method.

applicable Illinois laws and regulations, and additionally, with such local
franchise or other agreement with the village as permitted by law.



   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required.  Tree
trimming that is done by any other utility with facilities in the
right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws
and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal
maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.



      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for
tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be
accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in
accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be
expeditiously accomplished.



      (2)   Damage to trees.  Poor pruning practices resulting in
damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for
cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages.  The
village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees
removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International
Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the
compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village
may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical
pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.



   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance.  The village
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or
trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher
poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

§ 98.018  REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.



   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the
village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily
or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate
authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair,
maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way.



   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or
maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the
rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such
facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is
unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:



      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's
license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;



      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the
prior grant of a license or franchise, if required;



      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without
prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or



      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a
location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.



   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities.  The village
retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within
the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety
emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify
the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall
notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.



   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility
within the rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village
within 90 days.  Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of
Public Works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility or person.

terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the
rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This
includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the Director
of Public Works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to
restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that
which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period
provided in this section may be extended by the Director of Public Works for
good cause shown.

across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in
a manner satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense.



   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:



      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion
of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the
right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a
hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on
the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means
of access to the facility is available.



      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible,
notify the Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of
the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified
immediately.



      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.

   (A)   Request for variance.  A utility requesting a variance from
one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the
Director of Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.



   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Director of Public Works
shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.



   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance
has demonstrated that:



      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.



   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may
require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but
which carry out the purposes of this chapter.



   (E)   Right to appeal.  Any utility aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made
by the Director of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall
have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or
commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted
in writing to the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village
Board shall timely decide the appeal.

village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical, or material cost reasons the alternate location
does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.



      (8)   Height limitations.



         (a)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility

            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing
utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities,
that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village,
that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or

or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such
facility; or



            2.   45 feet above ground level.

poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.



      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which
a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the
permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this

or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the

the abandonment.



      (2)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known
address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not
removed within 90 days of such notice, the village may remove or cause the
removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment
agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are
provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost
recovery.

by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out
of the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A
wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of
the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further
waive any claims that they may have against he village with respect to
consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the

insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

   (G)   Prohibit uses or structures incompatible with the character of

(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.005  TRANSITION RULES.



   In determining the applicability of this chapter, with respect to the
previously applicable zoning regulations, the following rules shall apply:



   (A)   Existing illegal structures and uses. A structure or use that
is illegal at the time of the adoption of, but is made legal by the
provisions of this chapter, is deemed lawful as of the effective date of this
chapter. However, if that structure or use does not conform with each and
every requirement of this chapter, then that structure or use shall remain
illegal.



   (B)   Existing permitted uses. If property is used in a manner that
was classified as a permitted use prior to the effective date of this
chapter, and that use is classified as a special use by this chapter as of
the effective date of this chapter, that use shall be deemed a lawful special
use. However, any subsequent addition, enlargement or expansion of that use
shall be required to conform to the procedural and substantive requirements
for special uses pursuant to this chapter.



   (C)   Certain uses rendered nonconforming. If property is used in a
manner that was a lawful use before the effective date of this chapter, and
this chapter no longer classifies that use as either a permitted or special
use in the zoning district in which it is located, that use shall be deemed a
legal nonconforming use and shall be controlled by the provisions of §§
153.280 through 153.285.



   (D)   Certain structures rendered nonconforming. If structure
existing on the effective date of this chapter was a conforming structure
before the effective date of this chapter, and such structure does not meet
all standards set forth in this chapter, that structure shall be deemed a
legal nonconforming structure and shall be controlled by the provisions of
§§ 153.280 through 153.285.



   (E)   Previously issued building permits. If a building permit for a
building or structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this
chapter, and if construction has begun within 180 days of the issuance of
that permit and diligently pursued to completion, the structure may be
completed in accordance with the plans on the basis of which the building
permit was issued and may, upon completion, be occupied under an occupancy
permit for the use originally intended.



   (F)   Previously granted special uses and variations. All special
uses and variations granted prior to the effective date of this chapter shall
remain in full force and effect. The recipient of the special use or
variation may proceed to develop the property in accordance with the plans
approved by the Village Board or Planning and Zoning Commission and any
applicable conditions. However, if the recipient has failed to act on the
special use or variation before the approval expires, including any periods
of extension granted, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.



   (G)   Pending applications. If an application is pending on the
effective date of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall govern
that application.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)  Penalty, see §

§ 153.006  SEVERABILITY.

remainder of this chapter. The effect of the judgment shall be confined to

immediately involved in the controversy in which judgment or decree was
rendered.

site plan review, sign permit or appeals of Zoning Administrator
interpretations may be filed by an owner of any property in the village or

There shall be no refund of fees. Requests for withdrawal shall be in writing
by the applicant.



   (F)   Successive applications.



      (1)   Within one year of the date of denial, a subsequent
application shall not be reviewed or heard unless there is substantial new
evidence available, or if a significant mistake of law or of fact affected
the prior denial.



      (2)   If the application is resubmitted earlier than one year
from the date of denial, such subsequent application shall include a detailed
statement of the grounds justifying its consideration.



      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination as
to whether the subsequent application is appropriate for resubmittal prior to
the expiration of the one-year wait requirement. If the Zoning Administrator
finds that there are no new grounds for consideration of the subsequent
application, he or she shall summarily, and without hearing, deny the request.

§ 153.042  NOTICE.



   (A)   Published notices. For all applications that require a public

APPLICATIONS AND APPROVAL PROCESSES



§ 153.055  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to delineate the scope of
applicability, specific procedures and requirements, and approval standards
that are applicable to each zoning application and approval.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.056  ZONING AMENDMENT.



   (A)   Purpose. The regulations imposed and the districts created by
this chapter may be amended from time to time in accordance with this
subchapter. This process for amending the Zoning Code text or the zoning map
is intended to permit modifications in response to changed conditions or
changes in village policy.



   (B)   Initiation. An owner of any property in the village, other
person expressly authorized by the owner in writing, or the village may
propose zoning text or map amendments.



   (C)   Authority and execution. The Village Board, after receiving a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall take formal
action on requests for zoning text or map amendments.



   (D)   Procedure. All applications shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with the requirements of § 153.041. Once it is
determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall
schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Amendments initiated by the village also require an application,
but are exempt from fees.



      (1)   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a
public hearing on a proposed zoning amendment in accordance with § 153.043
no more than 60 days of receipt of a complete application. Notice for the
public hearing shall be in accordance with § 153.042. If, in the Planning
and Zoning Commission’ judgment, the application does not contain
sufficient information to enable the Board to properly discharge its
responsibilities, the Board may request additional information from the
applicant. In that event, the 60-day period shall be suspended pending
receipt of all requested information and/or the public hearing may be
continued.



         (b)   Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward to the Village Board its
recommendation, together with the minutes of the hearing.



         (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate
the application, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing,
pursuant to each of the applicable standards in division (E) below. For
zoning text amendments, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend
approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the application. For zoning
map amendments, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval
or denial of the application.



      (2)   Action by the Village Board. The Village Board shall
consider the application within 60 days of receiving the findings of fact and
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Village Board may
take action in the form of approval, approval with conditions, or denial on
applications for zoning text amendments, and approval or denial on
applications for zoning map amendments. The Village Board may also refer the
application back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further
consideration.



   (E)   Approval standards for zoning amendments. The Planning and
Zoning Commission’ recommendation and the Village Board’s decision on any
zoning amendment, whether text or map amendment, is a matter of legislative
discretion that is not controlled by any particular standard. However, in
making their recommendation and decision, the Planning and Zoning Commission
and the Village Board shall consider the following standards, as set forth in
Table 4-1: Standards for Zoning Amendments below.

§ 153.057  VARIATION.



   (A)   Purpose. The variation process is to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen
applications of this chapter that create practical difficulties or particular
hardships.



   (B)   Initiation. An owner of any property in the village or other
person expressly authorized by the owner in writing may request a variation
for that property.



   (C)   Authority and execution. Variations may be authorized after a
public hearing, where the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make
recommendation on and the Village Board shall decide upon a variation
application in accordance with division (F) below, that owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will
result in practical difficulties or particular hardship for the owner of land
or a structure.



   (D)   Limitations on variations. No variations shall be permitted
for the following regulations:



      (1)   To allow a use not listed as a permitted or special use
within the districts.



      (2)   An increase in lot coverage of 10% or more over that
allowed by the district regulations.



      (3)   An increase in impervious surface coverage of 10% or
more over that allowed by the district regulations.



      (4)   An increase in building height for a single-family or
two-family dwelling over that allowed by the district regulations.



   (E)   Procedure. All applications shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with the requirements in § 153.041. Once it is
determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall
forward a copy of the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission.



      (1)   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a
public hearing in accordance with § 153.043 no more than 60 days of receipt
of a complete application. Notice for the public hearing shall be in
accordance with § 153.042. If, in the Planning and Zoning Commission’
judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable
the Board to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may request additional information from the applicant. In that
event, the 60-day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested
information and/or the public hearing may be continued.



         (b)   Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the
Village Board, together with the minutes of the hearing.



         (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate
the application, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing,
pursuant to each of the applicable standards in division (F) below. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of the application.



         (d)   Every variation shall be accompanied by findings
of fact and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and specifications
for the variation, which shall remain part of the records of the Planning and
Zoning Commission.



      (2)   Action by the Village Board. The Village Board shall
consider the variation within 60 days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning
Commission recommendation. The Village Board may also refer the application
back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration.



      (3)   Conditions and restrictions. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may impose, such conditions
and restrictions upon the location, construction, design and use of the
property benefitted by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to
protect the public interest, adjacent property and property values. Failure
to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may be imposed shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the variation. The terms of relief
granted, including any conditions or restrictions, shall be specifically set
forth in the recommendation and approval.



   (F)   Approval Standards for Variations.



      (1)   No variation from the provisions of this chapter shall
be granted unless the Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Board make
specific written findings based on the standards imposed by this section.
These standards are as follows:



         (a)   The strict application of the terms of this
chapter will result in undue hardship unless the specific relief requested is
granted.



         (b)   The plight of the owner is due to unique
circumstances inherent to the subject property and not from the personal
situation of the owner.



         (c)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality.



      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Board, in
making its findings, may inquire into the following evidentiary issues, as
well as any others deemed appropriate:



         (a)   The particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property impose a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.



         (b)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been
created by any person presently having a proprietary interest in the property
in question.



         (c)   The granting of the variation will not be
detrimental to the public welfare in the neighborhood in which the property
is located.



         (d)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase
congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the
public safety or impair property values within the neighborhood.



         (e)   The proposed variation is consistent with the
spirit and intent of this chapter and the adopted Comprehensive Plan.



         (f)   The value of the property in question will be
substantially reduced (as compared with other properties in the same zoning
district) if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations governing the district in which it is located.



   (G)   Variation less than requested. A variation less than that
requested may be granted by the appropriate administrative body when the
record supports the applicant’s right to some relief, but not to the entire
relief requested.



   (H)   Revocation of variation. No order of the Village Board
granting a variation shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from
the date of such order unless a building permit is obtained within such
period, and the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is
commenced within such period. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend, and upon such recommendation, the Village Board may grant, one
extension of this period, valid for no more than 180 additional days, upon
written application, and good cause shown, without notice or hearing.



   (I)   Limitations on denials. No application for a variation, which
has been denied by the Village Board, shall be reconsidered for a period of
one year from that date of denial, except as described in § 153.041(F).



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.058  SPECIAL USE.



   (A)   Purpose. The development and execution of this chapter is
based upon the division of the village into districts. Within each district
the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land, are substantially uniform. It is
recognized, however, that there are specific uses which, because of their
unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular
district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of
those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular
use at the particular location. Such uses may be either public or private,
and are of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to
unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or
public facilities.



   (B)   Initiation. An owner of the subject property or other person
expressly authorized by the owner in writing may file an application to use
such land for one or more of the special uses provided for in this chapter
within the zoning district in which the land is situated or to change an
existing special use.



   (C)   Authority and execution. The Village Board, after receiving a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall take formal
action on special use requests.



   (D)   Procedure. An application for a special use shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator. All applications for a special use shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements in § 153.041. Once it is
determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall
schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.



      (1)   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a
public hearing on a proposed special use in accordance with § 153.043 no
more than 60 days from receipt of a complete application. Notice for the
public hearing shall be in accordance with § 153.042. If, in the Planning
and Zoning Commission’ judgment, the application does not contain
sufficient information to enable the Board to properly discharge its
responsibilities, the Board may request additional information from the
applicant. In that event, the 60-day period shall be suspended pending
receipt of all requested information and/or the public hearing may be
continued.



         (b)   Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the
Village Board, together with the minutes of the hearing.



         (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make
findings, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant
to each of the applicable standards in division (E) below. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall recommend either approval, approval with conditions,
or denial.



         (d)   Every special use shall be accompanied by findings
of fact and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and specifications
for the special use, which shall remain part of the records of the Planning
and Zoning Commission.



      (2)   Action by the Village Board. The Village Board shall
consider the special use within 60 days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning
Commission’ recommendation. In granting any special use, the Village Board
may require such evidence and guarantees, as it may deem necessary, to assure
compliance with the stipulated conditions. The Village Board may refer the
application back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further
consideration.



      (3)   Conditions on special uses. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may impose, such conditions
and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance
and operation of the special use as may be deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest.



   (E)   Approval standards for special uses. No special use shall be
recommended for approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved
by the Village Board unless they have made findings, based upon the evidence
presented at the public hearing, to support each of the following conclusions:



      (1)   The establishment, maintenance and operation of the
special use in the specific location proposed will not endanger the public
health, safety or general welfare of any portion of the community.



      (2)   The proposed special use is compatible with adjacent
properties and/or other properties within the immediate vicinity of the
special use.



      (3)   The special use in the specific location proposed is
consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and the Comprehensive
Plan.



   (F)   No presumption of approval. The listing of a use as a special
use within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption
that such special use will be approved. Rather, each proposed special use
shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to all applicable
standards of this chapter. Such evaluation will determine whether approval of
the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the
particular manner proposed.



   (G)   Revocation of special use permit. A special use permit may be
revoked by the Village Board after a finding of the existence of any one of
the following conditions or of the occurrence of any of the following events:



      (1)   The operation of the use for which a special use permit
has been issued ceases for a continuous period of 180 days.

§ 153.060  SITE PLAN REVIEW.



   (A)   Purpose. The site plan review process is intended to promote
orderly development and redevelopment in the village, and to assure that such
development or redevelopment occurs in a manner that is harmonious with
surrounding properties, is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and
promotes the general welfare of the village. This section provides standards
by which to determine and control the physical layout and design to achieve
the:



      (1)   Compatibility of land uses, buildings and structures.



      (2)   Protection and enhancement of community property values.



      (3)   Efficient use of land.



      (4)   Minimization of traffic and safety hazards.



      (5)   Efficient parking layout.



      (6)   Minimization of environmental problems, including
stormwater management and incorporation of sustainable design techniques.



   (B)   Authority and execution.



      (1)   Site plan review and approval is required for the
following:



         (a)   Building permits for new townhouse, multi-family,
non-residential and mixed-use developments.



         (b)   Building permits for additions to townhouse,
multi-family, non-residential and mixed-use developments. Modifications of
all outdoor recreational areas that include the construction of new
buildings, accessory structures and/or exterior lighting are also subject to
site plan review. However, playground equipment is considered exempt from
site plan review.



         (c)   Building permits for construction of parking lots
of ten or more spaces.



         (d)   Stealth design for wireless antennas, in
accordance with § 153.177(R)(10).



      (2)   No building permit shall be issued until site plan
approval has been granted. If the Planning and Zoning Commission approves a
site plan, a building permit may then be issued, provided that all other
requirements of all other applicable village codes and ordinances are
satisfied.



   (C)   Procedure. Applications for site plan review shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements in
§ 153.041. Once it is determined that the application is complete, the
application shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission.



      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
completed site plan review application no more than 60 days from receipt of a
complete application. If, in the Planning and Zoning Commission judgment, the
site plan review application does not contain sufficient information to
enable the Planning and Zoning Commission to properly discharge its
responsibilities, the Planning and Zoning Commission may request additional
information from the applicant. In that event, the 60- day period shall be
suspended pending receipt of all requested information.



      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve,
approve with conditions or deny the site plan within 60 days. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant within ten days of the action taken.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate the site plan pursuant to
the applicable standards in division (D) below.



      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may request
modification of the submitted site plan and resubmittal of such revised site
plan. The revised site plan shall be processed in the same manner†as the
initial site plan review application. No new fees shall be required.



      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve the site
plan subject to certain conditions or minor modifications to be listed in the
resolution approving the application. All plans and drawings submitted as
part of the application for a building permit must include those conditions
or minor modifications stated within the resolution in order for a building
permit to be issued.



   (D)   Standards for site plan review.



      (1)   Each site plan submitted for review shall include the
following details: the location of principal and accessory structures,
infrastructure, open space, landscaping, exterior lighting, traffic movement
and flow, number of parking spaces, design of parking lots, and location of
landscaping and screening. In reviewing site plans, the relationship of the
site plan to adopted land use policies, and the goals and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan shall be evaluated.



      (2)   In addition, the following characteristics shall also be
considered:



         (a)   Degree of conformity with existing standards.



         (b)   Regulations of this chapter, and any other
applicable regulations within the village’s Municipal Code, and the goals
and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.



         (c)   The location, arrangement, size, design and
general site compatibility of buildings, lighting and signs, including:



            1.   Efficient use of land that responds to the
existing off-site utilities and service conditions in order to minimize the
demand for additional municipal services, utilities and infrastructure.



            2.   Compatibility with, and mitigation of, any
potential impact upon, adjacent property.



            3.   Site illumination designed and installed to
minimize adverse impact on adjacent properties.



            4.   Signs in accordance with §§ 153.255 through
153.265.



         (d)   Landscaping and the arrangement of open space or
natural features on the site should:



            1.   Create a desirable and functional environment
for motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and occupants of residential
dwellings, business owners and employees. To achieve such an environment,
landscaping may take advantage of open space design features such as bike
paths, running paths and outdoor relaxation areas.



            2.   Preserve unique natural resources, including
measures to preserve and protect existing healthy, mature trees.



            3.   Protect natural resources and landscaping on
adjacent sites.



            4.   Design drainage facilities to promote the use
and preservation of natural watercourses and patterns of drainage.



            5.   Utilize plant materials suitable to withstand
the climatic conditions of the village and microclimate of the site. The use
of species native to northeastern Illinois is encouraged.



            6.   Use of screening to buffer the impact of the
development on adjacent uses and enhance the appearance and image of the
village by screening incompatible uses and certain site elements, and
creating a logical transition to adjoining lots and developments.



         (e)   Circulation systems and off-street parking shall
be designed to:



            1.   Provide adequate and safe access to the site
for motor vehicles as well as alternate modes of transportation, including
pedestrians and bicyclists.



            2.   Minimizing potentially dangerous traffic
movements.



            3.   Separate pedestrian and auto circulation and
provide for bicycle parking or storage insofar as practical.



            4.   Minimize curb cuts by using cross-access
easements and shared parking.



            5.   Design off-street parking lots or garages to
minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties, particularly through the use
of perimeter and interior landscaping, and promote logical and safe parking
and internal circulation.



            6.   Clearly define pedestrian access from the
parking area to the building(s). A clearly defined visible and identifiable
network of pedestrian connections should be provided in and between parking
lots, street sidewalks, open spaces and buildings.



   (E)   Amendments to approved site plan reviews.



      (1)   An application for an amendment to an approved site plan
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator. Amendment applications shall
include a written description of the proposed change, including the reason
for such change, and a notation of the location on the approved site plan.



      (2)   Minor changes, as required by technical engineering or
other physical site circumstances not foreseen at the time that the site plan
was approved, and verified by the Village Engineer, may be authorized by the
Zoning Administrator, who shall reserve the right to forward any such request
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval. All other changes require
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider
amendment applications within 60 days of receipt of a complete application.
If, in the Planning and Zoning Commission’ judgment, the application does
not contain sufficient information to enable the Planning and Zoning
Commission to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may request additional information from the applicant. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall provide its decision in writing, along
with reasons for approval or denial.



      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may decide that the
proposed change or changes to the approved site plan is such a significant
change that it constitutes a new application and is subject to the complete
site plan review provisions of this section.



      (5)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may determine that a
proposed amendment to an approved site plan requires submittal of a revised
site plan for proper evaluation. Such revised site plan shall only include
those components of the site plan submittal package impacted by the proposed
change. Until such revised site plan is submitted, the application shall not
be considered complete. Nothing within this section shall prevent an
applicant from submitting a revised site plan with the amendment application
at the time of initial submission.

surrounding properties, and it shall cause no substantial impairment of the
use of those properties.



   (E)   Planned unit developments shall not adversely affect the
natural environment of the community as a whole. Natural assets and features,
such as existing trees and native vegetation, shall be protected and
preserved to the greatest extent practical.



   (F)   The site shall be accessible to public streets that are
adequate to carry the traffic that will be generated by the proposed
development. The streets and driveways within the proposed development shall
be adequate to serve the uses within the development. The applicant shall be
responsible for the cost and installation of additional traffic controls and
regulating devices that are required.



   (G)   All proposed streets, alleys and driveways shall be adequate

§ 153.084  EXCEPTIONS FROM DISTRICT REGULATIONS.



   (A)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the
Village Board may grant exceptions to the district bulk regulations where a
planned unit development is located. The planned unit development is subject
to the underlying district regulations unless such exception is specifically
granted. Exceptions from district regulations may be granted for planned unit
developments, if the Village Board finds that such exceptions meet all of the
following standards:



      (1)   Enhance the overall merit of the planned unit
development.



      (2)   Promote the objectives of both the village and the
development.



      (3)   Enhance the quality of the design of the structures and
the site plan.



      (4)   Enable the development to offer environmental and
pedestrian amenities.



      (5)   Will not cause such an adverse impact on neighboring
properties so as to outweigh the benefits of the development.



      (6)   Are compatible with the land use policies of the
village’s Comprehensive Plan.



      (7)   Provide a public benefit to the village, as described in
division (D) below.



   (B)   The planned unit development is subject to the underlying
district use regulations. However, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend and the Village Board may permit uses other than those allowed
within the district when it is determined by the Village Board to be
desirable in achieving the objectives of the planned unit development, except
within the residential districts. No use exceptions are permitted in the
residential districts. There must be clear evidence that such uses are
desirable and appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development, and are not of such a nature, or so located, as to exercise a
detrimental influence on the development or the surrounding neighborhood.



   (C)   The underlying zoning district requirements shall apply,
unless an exception is granted by ordinance as part of the approved special
use. Exceptions to district regulations may be granted where it is determined
that such modifications shall not negatively affect the value and enjoyment
of surrounding property, the provision of municipal services, or the flow of
traffic. To be granted such exceptions, the applicant must demonstrate
superior design and enhanced amenities. In no case shall an exception to
district regulations within a planned unit development be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the village.



   (D)   The following design characteristics and amenities are
provided as a guide for consideration as to whether to grant an exception to
district requirements. The following items are a guide and not an exclusive
list of requirements. Additional design characteristics and amenities not
listed may be considered as part of the approval process.



      (1)   Landscaping, buffering or screening within or around the
perimeter of the planned unit development that is in addition to the minimum
required by this chapter.

   In its establishment and authorization as a special use, in addition to
the special use standards of § 153.058, the following procedures,
requirements, restrictions, and conditions shall be observed. In addition to
the special use procedures, approval of a planned unit development is a
four-step process, which includes a pre-application consultation, optional 
concept plan, preliminary plan, and final plan. No plats shall be recorded
and no building permit shall be issued until a final plan has been approved.



   (A)   Pre-application consultation.



      (1)   Prior to the filing of an application for a planned unit
development, the applicant shall confer with the Zoning Administrator, as
well as other village staff the Zoning Administrator deems appropriate to
confer with, regarding the proposed development. At the pre-application
meeting the applicant shall provide information as to the location of the
proposed planned unit development, the proposed uses, proposed public and
private improvements, a list of any known exceptions to this chapter and
other ordinances of the village, and any other information necessary to
clearly explain the planned unit development. The purpose of such
pre-application presentation and conference is to make advice and assistance
available to the applicant before preparation of the optional concept plan or
required preliminary plan, so that the applicant may determine:



         (a)   Whether the proposed planned unit development
appears in general to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.



         (b)   Whether any zoning exceptions are required in
connection with the proposed planned unit development.



         (c)   Whether the proposed planned unit development will
be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, and the goals and policies of
the village for development. The pre-application conference does not require
formal application, fee or filing of a planned unit development application.



      (2)   Any opinions or advice provided by the Zoning
Administrator shall be in no way binding with respect to any official action
the Planning and Zoning Commission or Village Board may take on the
subsequent formal application.



   (B)   Optional concept plan.



      (1)   Before submitting a formal application for a planned

explanation of the planned unit development, including a statement of the
present ownership of all the land within said development and the expected
schedule of construction.



      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
concept plan, and provide such information and guidance as it deems
appropriate. Any opinions or advice provided by the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall be in no way binding with respect to any official action the
Planning and Zoning Commission or Village Board may take on the subsequent
formal application. The review of the concept plan shall not be a public
hearing, and any failure to observe formal procedures shall not affect the
ultimate validity of any enabling legislation.

unit development, the procedure shall be as follows:



      (1)   Minor changes. Minor changes, as required by engineering
or other physical site circumstances not foreseen at that time that the final
plan was approved, and verified by the Village Engineer, may be authorized by
the Zoning Administrator, who shall reserve to the right to forward any
requests for changes to the Village Board. Any item listed in division
(A)(2)(c) below shall not be considered a minor change. Any changes to the

must be approved by the Village Board as an amendments to the planned unit
development ordinance.



         (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review
the request for a major change at a public hearing within 60 days of receipt
of a request. If, in the Planning and Zoning Commission judgment, the
application does not contain sufficient information to enable the Planning
and Zoning Commission to properly discharge its responsibilities, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may request additional information from the
applicant. In that event, the 60-day period shall be suspended pending
receipt of all requested information and/or the public hearing continued.
Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall recommend either approval or denial of the request for a
major change, and submit its written recommendation to the Village Board. The
Village Board, after receipt of a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall approve, approve with modifications or deny the request for
a major change within 60 days following the receipt of the recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Village Board may also decide that
the request for a major change is so significant that it must be considered a
new planned unit development application and should be resubmitted as such.



         (c)   Major changes shall include, but are not limited
to, the following:



            1.   A change in the number of dwelling units, the

            8.   A change or relocation of rights of way shown
on the approved final plan in any manner or to any extent that decreases
their functionality, adversely affects their relation to surrounding land use
and rights-of-way elements, or reduces their effectiveness as buffers or
amenities.



            9.   An alteration, whether an increase or
decrease, in the amount of any land use in any stage of the development by
more than 10% or a change in the overall final approved and use mix.



            10.   A reduction in the number of parking spaces
or an increase of more than five parking spaces. An increase of up to five
spaces shall be considered a minor change.



            11.   A change to the landscape plan that results
in a reduction in the net amount of plant material. Changes to the landscape
plan, which do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant material,
a change in species or do not violate the landscaping requirements of this
chapter, shall be considered a minor change.



   (B)   After construction. After the completion of construction of
the planned unit development, all changes to the final plan must be made by
the Village Board under the procedure authorized for a special use (§
153.058). Upon review of the proposed changes, the Zoning Administrator
and/or Village Board may determine that the proposed changes to the planned

      (1)   Right-of-way lines. Where zoning district boundary lines
coincide with streets, alleys, highways, easements, or right-of-way lines of
railroads, toll roads or expressways, the boundary line shall be construed to
be the centerline of the right-of-way.



      (2)   Property lines. Where zoning district boundary lines
coincide with a recorded property line, the property line shall be construed
to be the boundary line of the district.



      (3)   Scaled lines. Where the district boundary lines do not
coincide with a right-of-way line or recorded property line, the district
boundary shall be determined by measuring such boundary line(s) by using the
map scale as provided on the Official Zoning Map.



      (4)   Clarification of boundary lines. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall decide all interpretations of zoning district boundary
lines, where the application of division (B)(1) through (3) above leaves
doubt as to the boundary between two zoning districts.

§ 153.115  RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS PURPOSE STATEMENTS.



   (A)   Purpose of R-1A Single-Family Residential Zoning District. The
R-1A Single-Family Residential Zoning District is intended for those areas of
single-family homes located upon larger lots than the typical single-family
zoning lot in the village. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible
with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted, as provided
herein.



   (B)   Purpose of R-1 Single-Family Residential Zoning District. The
R-1 Single-Family Residential Zoning District is intended for those areas of
single-family homes located upon sites of the typical zoning lot size for
single-family housing within the village. Limited non-residential uses that
are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted,
as provided herein.



   (C)   Purpose of R-2 Two-Family Residential Zoning District. The R-2
Two-Family Residential Zoning District is intended for areas of moderate
density where single-family and two-family dwellings are located, similar in
dimension to the typical lot size for single-family housing within the
community. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding
residential neighborhoods may be permitted, as provided herein.



   (D)   Purpose of R-3 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District. The
R-3 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to create a moderate
density environment of single-family, two-family, three-family and
four-family dwellings. This district may function as a transition zone
between single-family neighborhoods and adjacent higher intensity land uses.
Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential
neighborhoods may be permitted, as provided herein.



   (E)   Purpose of R-4 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District. The
R-4 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to create a higher
density environment of multi-family dwellings and townhomes, as well as
three-family and four-family dwellings. Such areas may function as a
transition zone between residential neighborhoods and adjacent higher
intensity and non-residential land uses. Limited non-residential uses that
are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted,
as provided herein.

§ 153.130  COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS PURPOSE STATEMENTS.



   (A)   Purpose of C-1 Commercial Corridor Zoning District. The
purpose of the C-1 Commercial Corridor Zoning District is to promote
development of storefront space and provide for a mix of retail, personal
service and office uses along the commercial corridors within the village. It
should maintain a traditional commercial character, distinguished by a
pedestrian-friendly orientation, storefronts opening to the public sidewalk,
and, when parking is provided, it is located to the rear of buildings.
Mixed-use development is encouraged, and residential dwelling units are
permitted above the ground floor.



   (B)   Purpose of C-2 Village Center Zoning District. The purpose of
the C-2 Village Center Zoning District is to preserve and provide for those
retail, personal service and office uses located within a larger village
center environment, which serves the residents of the village as well as
surrounding areas. The C-2 District provides for large-scale development that
generates a sizeable amount of traffic and a significant demand for
off-street parking. Future mixed-use development is encouraged, and
residential dwelling units are permitted above the ground floor.

§ 153.133  COMMERCIAL DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS.



   Development within the C-1 and C-2 Districts shall comply with the
design standards of this section. Franchise establishments must also adhere
to these standards. Figure 8-1: Commercial Design Guidelines illustrates
these design guidelines.



   (A)   Facade.



      (1)   Multi-story buildings shall be designed with a definable
base, middle and top. Rooflines, cornice treatments and window designs should
divide larger buildings.



      (2)   Facades of buildings, including side facades, shall be
visually broken into bays to avoid the appearance of large, blank walls. When
visible from the public right-of-way, facades must include architectural
features to avoid the appearance of blank walls facing the street. These
include, but are not limited to, changes in the wall plane of at least two 
feet, changes in wall texture or masonry patterns, colonnade, columns or
pilasters.



      (3)   The use of multiple materials, textures or colors is
required to add visual interest to the facade. Building facades in excess of
100 feet must include a repeating pattern with no less than two of the
following elements: color change, texture change, material module change, or
a wall articulation change of no less than two feet such as an offset,
reveal, pilaster or projecting rib. All elements must repeat at intervals of
no more than 25 feet.



      (4)   Predominant facade colors must be subtle, neutral or
earth-tone colors. Primary colors, high-intensity colors, metallic or
fluorescent colors, and black are prohibited as predominant facade colors.
Building trim and accent areas may be brighter and include primary colors.



   (B)   Fenestration.



      (1)   Windows shall be set back into or projected out from the
facade to provide depth and shadow. Windows shall include visually prominent
sills or other appropriate forms of framing. Awnings or shutters should be
used to accentuate window openings and add interest to the design of the
building.



      (2)   The ground floor shall maintain a transparency of 60%.
Windows shall be constructed of clear or lightly tinted glass (no tinting
above 20% or reflective glass).



   (C)   Rooflines.



      (1)   Roofs shall be designed as an integral part of the
facade design.



      (2)   Roof lines must either be varied with a change in height
or with the incorporation of a major focal point feature, such as a dormer,
gable or projected wall feature, every 100 linear feet in building length.



      (3)   Mansard roofs are prohibited.



      (4)   Parapet walls shall feature three-dimensional cornice
treatments or other shadow-creating detail elements along their tops.



      (5)   “Green roof” designs are encouraged.



   (D)   Entrances.



      (1)   All buildings shall have a public entrance from the
sidewalk along the primary street frontage. Public entrances should be
articulated from the building mass.



      (2)   Facades that abut parking areas and contain a public
entrance shall make provision for pedestrian walkways and landscape areas.



      (3)   If outlot buildings are part of a large retail
development, outlot buildings must define the street frontage by placement
near the street with showcase windows and entrances oriented toward the
street, as well as to the interior parking lot.



   (E)   Building materials.



      (1)   The following materials are permitted for use on
exterior elevations:



         (a)   Clay brick.



         (b)   Natural or cast stone.



         (c)   Wood.



         (d)   Architectural pre-cast concrete panels (flat
panels with no detail are prohibited).



      (2)   The following building materials are prohibited.
However, such materials may be used as part of decorative or detail elements,
or as part of the exterior construction that is not used as a surface finish
material.



         (a)   Plain concrete block.



         (b)   Utility brick.



         (c)   Aluminum, steel or other metal sidings.



         (d)   Metal wall panels.



         (e)   Exposed aggregate (rough finish) concrete wall
panels.



         (f)   Exterior insulating finish systems (EIFS).



         (g)   Plastic.



         (h)   Glass curtain walls.

excluding alleys.



      (3)   An antenna or tower that is proposed to exceed the
height limitations shall be considered a special use. The operator must
provide evidence that a taller tower and/or antenna is necessary to engage
successfully in amateur radio communications. In addition, the applicant must
provide evidence that the tower and/or antenna shall not prove a hazard to
birds (i.e., minimal chance of bird strikes). As part of the application, the
applicant must submit a site plan showing the proposed location of the tower
and/or antenna, as well as its relation to the principal building and any
additional accessory structures.

location, and shall be screened by an architectural feature. The visible
portion of the dish should not comprise more than  25% of the corresponding
height or width of the screen.



            3.   Ground-mounted satellite dish antenna shall
provide screening, which includes fencing, berming or landscaping to
accomplish the following:



               A.    All ground-mounted accessory equipment
and the lower part of the support structure shall be completely screened.



               B.   Where feasible, trees shall be
installed to the side and rear of the antenna and at a height/elevation equal
to the tallest portion of the dish.



   (L)   Sheds and private greenhouses.



      (1)   Sheds and private greenhouses are permitted only in the
rear yard and setback. Sheds and private greenhouses shall be located a
minimum of five feet from any rear lot line and three feet from a side lot
line.



      (2)   The maximum height of any shed or private greenhouse
shall be ten feet.



      (3)   No shed or private greenhouse shall exceed 120 square
feet.



      (4)   Sheds and private greenhouses shall be located a minimum
of ten feet from the principal structure on a lot. The distance shall be
measured from the walls of the structure.

   (O)   Wind turbines. Wind turbines are subject to the following
requirements:



      (1)   Wind turbines are subject to the following height
restrictions:



         (a)   The maximum height of any ground-mounted wind
turbine (a tower) is the height limit of the applicable zoning district.



         (b)   The maximum height of any wind turbine mounted
upon a detached accessory structure is 15 feet above the maximum permitted
height for such structure. The maximum height of any wind turbine mounted
upon a principal structure is the height limit of the applicable zoning
district.



         (c)   For purposes of this particular zoning item,
maximum height is the total height of the turbine system including the tower,
and the maximum vertical height of the turbines blades. Maximum height
therefore is calculated measuring the length of a prop at maximum vertical
rotation to the base of the tower. The maximum height of any ground-mounted
wind energy system is measured from the length of a prop at maximum vertical
rotation to grade.



         (d)   No portion of exposed turbine blades may be within
20 feet of the ground. Unexposed turbine blades may be within ten feet of the
ground.



      (2)   Ground-mounted wind turbines may be located in the rear
yard only. A ground-mounted tower must be setback from all lot lines equal to
the height of the tower. Additional parts of the wind turbine structure
outside of the tower, including guy wire anchors, must be ten feet to any lot
line.



      (3)   All wind turbines must be equipped with manual
(electronic or mechanical) and automatic over speed controls to limit the
blade rotation speed to within the design limits of the system.



      (4)   Wind turbines may not exceed 60 dBA, as measured at the
closest neighboring dwelling. The level, however, may be exceeded during
short-term events such as utility outages and/or severe windstorms.



      (5)   Wind turbines must be approved by a small wind
certification program recognized by the American Wind Energy Association
(AWEA) or the U.S. Department of Energy. Non-certified residential wind
turbines must submit a description of the safety features of the turbine
prepared by a registered mechanical engineer.



      (6)   Wind turbines must comply with applicable FAA
regulations, including any necessary approvals for installations close to
airports.



      (7)   Building permit applications for wind turbines must be
accompanied by a line drawing of the electrical components in sufficient
detail to allow for a determination that the manner of the installation
conforms to all electrical codes.



   (P)   Window wells.



      (1)   The maximum amount of all window wells located along any
wall may not exceed 40% of the length of that wall.



      (2)   Window wells may encroach up to three feet into the
required rear setback and may encroach up to a maximum of two feet into a
required interior or corner side setback. Window wells are prohibited in the
front setback or yard.



      (3)   When more than one window well is installed along a
wall, each shall be separated at least three feet from one another.



      (4)   Window wells used for egress shall comply with the
provisions of the building code for an emergency escape window.

temporary use permit, as required by this Code, shall file a written
application with the Zoning Administrator on a form provided by the village.



      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall grant temporary use
permits for those uses listed below so long as he or she determines that the
proposed use, complies with the requirements of this section and this Code.
Unless expressly provided in this section, every temporary use or structure
shall comply with the bulk requirements applicable in the district in which
it is located.



      (3)   Temporary uses not specifically listed here shall
require the specific approval of the Village Board. Unless otherwise limited,
temporary uses may be allowed in any zoning district, provided that it is
consistent with the purpose and intent of this Code and the zoning district
in which it is located.



      (4)   Every temporary use shall comply with this Code and all
local regulations. The Zoning Administrator or Village Board may impose other
conditions, as part of the temporary use permit approval, as necessary to
achieve the purposes of this Code, and to protect the public health, safety,
comfort, convenience and general welfare. No temporary use shall be permitted
in any district if it would have a significant negative impact on any
adjacent property or on the area as a whole.



   (B)   General provisions. Every temporary use shall comply with all
the requirements listed below.



      (1)   No temporary use shall be permitted that causes, or

safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.



      (2)   Every temporary use shall be operated in accordance with
such restrictions and conditions as the Fire Department may require. If
required by the village, the operator of the temporary use shall employ
appropriate security personnel.



      (3)   No temporary use shall be permitted if the additional
vehicular traffic reasonably expected to be generated by such use would have
undue detrimental effects on surrounding streets and uses. No temporary use
shall block handicapped or fire lanes.



      (4)   No temporary use shall be authorized that would
unreasonably reduce the amount of parking spaces available for use in
connection with permanent uses located on the lot in question. The Zoning
Administrator may make an assessment of the total number of parking spaces
that will be reasonably required in connection with a proposed temporary use,
on the basis of the particular use, its intensity and the availability of
other parking facilities in the area. The Zoning Administrator shall approve
the temporary use only if such parking spaces are provided.



      (5)   No temporary use shall be permitted if it conflicts with
another previously authorized temporary use.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING



§ 153.205  PURPOSE.



   The off-street parking and loading regulations of this subchapter are
intended to provide accessible, attractive, secure and well-maintained
off-street parking and loading areas with the appropriate number of spaces in
proportion to the needs of the proposed use, increase public safety by
reducing congestion of public streets, and encourage the use of alternative
modes of transportation where appropriate.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.206  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   The provisions of this subchapter shall apply as follows:



   (A)   Existing facilities.



      (1)   The existing number of off-street parking and loading
spaces shall not be reduced below the requirements of this subchapter. If the
number of such existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this
subchapter, it shall not be further reduced.



      (2)   Existing off-street parking and loading areas which do
not conform to the requirements of this subchapter, but were in conformance
with the requirements of this Code at the time the parking or loading
facilities were established, are permitted to continue as a legal
nonconforming structure.



      (3)   If a building permit for a building or structure was
lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this Code, and if construction
has begun within 180 days of the issuance of a permit, the number of
off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in the amount
required for the issuance of said building permit, regardless of what may be
required by this subchapter.



   (B)   Damage or destruction. When a building is reconstructed or
repaired after being damaged or destroyed, off-street parking and loading
facilities shall be restored or maintained in an amount equivalent to that at
the time of such damage or destruction. However, it shall not be necessary to
restore or maintain parking and loading facilities in excess of the
applicable requirements of this subchapter.



   (C)   Change in land use. When the existing use of a structure or
land is changed to a new use, parking and loading spaces shall be provided as
required for the new use. Additional parking or loading spaces shall be
required in the amount by which the requirements for the new use exceed the
requirements for the existing use.



   (D)   Change in intensity of use.



      (1)   When the intensity of use of any structure or land is
increased, additional parking and loading spaces shall be provided. The
number of additional parking and loading spaces shall be based on the
increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity,
or other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required number
of parking or loading spaces.



      (2)   When the intensity of use of any structure or land is
decreased, the number of parking and loading spaces may be reduced so long as
the parking requirements of this subchapter are met for the entire structure
or land as modified.



   (E)   Provision of additional spaces. Nothing in this subchapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of additional
off-street parking or loading facilities, provided that all regulations
governing the location, design and control of such facilities are in
accordance with this subchapter.

§ 153.207  COMPUTATION.



   The total number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based
upon the requirements for the principal use of the lot. However, when more
than one use occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces shall be
the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All off-street parking
facilities shall be completed before occupancy of the structure. In computing
the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required by this
subchapter, the following standards for computation shall apply:



   (A)   Space allocated to any off-street loading space shall not be
used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street parking space or access
aisle, or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street
parking space shall not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street
loading space or portion thereof.



   (B)   A fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, and a
fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking or loading space.



   (C)   In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy
benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating
facility shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the
requirement for off-street parking facilities.



   (D)   Except as otherwise specified, parking or loading spaces
required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of
employees normally present on the premises at any one time. When the
determination of the number of parking spaces is based on the number of
employees, the owner and/or manager shall be counted as an employee(s).

§ 153.208  CONSTRUCTION OF PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.



   (A)   Site plan review required. Site plan review, in accordance
with § 153.060, is required prior to any construction, alteration or
addition of any parking facility providing ten or more parking spaces, and
for the construction of a new loading berth. For purposes of this subchapter,
construction, alteration or addition shall include all paving of previously
unpaved surfaces, replacement of pavement with new binder and surface
courses, construction of curbing, installation of new parking lot
landscaping, and similar activities. Construction, alteration or addition
shall not include maintenance activities such as replacement of existing
landscaping, repair of existing curbing, repairs, sealing, re-striping, or
placement of surface course pavement over previously paved areas. No permit
shall be required for maintenance activities.



   (B)   Time of completion. Off-street parking and loading facilities
required by this subchapter shall be completed prior to the issuance of the
occupancy permit for the use they serve.

§ 153.209  COLLECTIVE PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the
sum of the spaces required for each use separately. No parking or loading
space, or portion thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than
one use with the exception of the following shared parking arrangement
described in division (B) below.



   (B)   An off-street parking facility may be shared between two or
more uses, provided that use of such facility by each user does not occur at
the same time. No shared use of parking spaces shall be permitted unless:



      (1)   Approval is obtained from the Zoning Administrator that
confirms that the use of such facility by each user does not take place at
the same hours during the same days of the week.



      (2)   The users of the shared parking facility shall record an
agreement to share parking facilities, subject to approval by the Village
Attorney. A copy of the recorded agreement shall be given to the village.



      (3)   The location and design requirements of this subchapter
are met.



      (4)   Any subsequent change in ownership or use shall require
proof that the minimum parking requirements, per this subchapter, have been
met for each use. The owner of an existing building or use shall have 180
days within which to accommodate all required off-street parking or to apply
for a variation. If the owner is unable to accommodate the parking or fails
to apply for a variation, then the occupancy permit shall be revoked with
respect to the use for which the separate parking was required. The occupancy
permit shall be reinstated when all applicable provisions of this subchapter
are complied with. As an alternative to a variation, a new shared parking
agreement may be arranged in accordance with this subchapter.

§ 153.210  LAND BANKED FUTURE PARKING.



   Land banking allows for designating a portion of land on a site that
would be required for parking to be held and preserved as open space, rather
than constructed as parking. The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit
land banking of up to 25% of the required parking spaces through the site
plan review process.



   (A)   Sufficient evidence shall be provided by the applicant that
supports the reduced parking needs.



   (B)   The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces shall be
an area suitable for parking at a future time.



   (C)   Landscaping of the land banked area shall be in full
compliance of the zoning regulations and, at a minimum, landscaped with turf.
As a result of the site plan review process, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require additional landscaping of the land banked area.



   (D)   The land banked area cannot be used for any other use and must
be part of the same zoning lot and all under the same ownership.



   (E)   As part of the site plan review process, the applicant shall
show the area to be banked on the site plan and marked as “Land Banked
Future Parking.”



   (F)   The Zoning Administrator, on the basis of increased parking
demand for the use, shall require the conversion of all or part of the land
banked area to off-street parking spaces.

§ 153.211  LOCATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.



   (A)   Residential uses.



      (1)   All required parking spaces for residential uses shall
be located on the same lot as the building or use served.



      (2)   For single-family, two-family and townhouse dwellings,
parking shall be permitted in private driveways, but no such parking may
encroach onto the public right-of-way. However, such driveway parking shall
not be considered as satisfying the off-street parking requirements for such
single-family, two-family and townhouse dwellings.



      (3)   Tandem parking is permitted for townhouse or
multi-family dwellings but both spaces must be allotted to the same dwelling
unit and located on the same lot as the dwelling.



   (B)   Non-residential uses.



      (1)   All required off-street parking areas for
non-residential uses shall be located on the same lot as, or within 300 feet
of, the building or use served. However, off-street parking accessory to a
non-residential use shall not be located in any residential district.



      (2)   Off-street parking spaces are permitted within the rear,
interior side or corner side yard and setback, subject to buffer yard
standards of § 153.240 in all non-residential districts except the C-1
District. No parking is permitted in the front yard of the C-1 District. No
required off-street parking spaces are permitted within a required front
setback.

§ 153.212  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   All off-street parking facilities shall comply with the following
standards:



   (A)   Dimensions.



      (1)   Off-street parking spaces shall be shall be designed in
accordance with Figure 13-1: Off-Street Parking Dimensions.



      (2)   All parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical
clearance of seven feet, six inches.



   (B)   Access.



      (1)   Each off-street space shall open directly upon an aisle
or driveway of such width as will provide adequate means of vehicular access
to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be provided
with appropriate means of vehicular access in a manner that least interferes
with traffic movement and allows the driver of the vehicle to proceed forward
into traffic rather than back out.



      (2)   All required off-street parking facilities shall have
vehicular access from a street, alley, driveway or cross-access connection.



      (3)   Within off-street parking facilities one-way traffic
aisles shall be at least 12 feet in width and two-way traffic aisles shall be
at least 24 feet in width. Furthermore, all aisles shall be designed in
accordance with Figure 13-1: Off-Street Parking Dimensions.

      (4)   Driveways.



         (a)   Residential driveways, excluding multi-family and
townhouse dwellings.



            1.   A residential driveway that provides access
to a detached garage shall be no more than 12 feet in width. A driveway
apron, the width of the garage as measured from the garage walls, is
permitted to extend for a distance (depth) of 20 feet from the garage doors
before tapering back to the required driveway width to allow access to the
additional spaces. (See Figure 13-2: Residential Driveway Width.)



            2.   A residential driveway that provides access
to an attached garage shall be no wider than the width of the garage. (See
Figure 13-2.)



            3.    Driveways shall be located a minimum of one
foot from the side lot line. However, a residential driveway may be located
on the lot line if it physically abuts a driveway on the adjacent lot. This
location shall only be allowed if agreed to by the owners of each lot, and
such approval is recorded as a shared driveway easement on each plat of
survey.



            4.   Single-family and two-family dwellings are
permitted an additional paved parking pad. Such parking pads shall not be
located in the front or corner side yard or setback, or within the required
interior side setback. Any driveways must comply with the requirements of
division (B)(4)(a)1. above. The maximum impervious surface requirement for
the lot may not be exceeded to accommodate a parking pad. Figure 13-3:
Parking Pad Location illustrates where a parking pad may be located.

            1.   Except for access to loading berths, no
driveway shall have a width exceeding 24 feet. Driveways shall be a minimum
of 12 feet for one-way drives, and a minimum of 24 feet for two-way drives.



            2.   Driveways, off-street parking areas and
access aisles for multi-family residential and non-residential parking lots
shall be designed in accordance with Figure 13-1: Off-Street Parking
Dimensions.



         (c)   Single-family and two-family dwelling driveway
curb cuts.



            1.   Only one driveway curb cut shall be permitted
on a zoning lot for a new single-family or two-family dwelling, unless the
lot has a lot width of 55 feet or more, in which case, two  curb cuts are
permitted to construct a circular drive. In no case, shall the impervious
surface requirement be exceeded.



            2.   Existing lots with more than one curb cut
and/or a circular driveway that exists at the time of adoption of this Code,
may replace and repair the existing driveway, provided that the driveway is
not enlarged and that the minimum impervious surface requirement for the lot
is not exceeded at the time of replacement or repair.



   (C)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas shall be improved
with a hard surfaced, all-weather dustless material as approved by the
Village Engineer. Semi-pervious materials such as grass-crete and pervious
pavers may also be used, subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.



   (D)   Striping. Off-street parking areas of four or more spaces
shall delineate parking spaces with paint or other permanent materials, which
shall be maintained in clearly visible condition. Parking spaces for
handicapped persons shall be identified with the appropriate sign and shall
be visible at all times of the year, regardless of snow cover, plant growth
or similar conditions.



   (E)   Curbing and bumper stops. Bumper stops, wheel stops or curbing
shall be provided to prevent vehicles from damaging or encroaching upon any
adjacent parking or loading space, sidewalk, landscaped area or parking lot
island, fence, wall or building. Curbing shall be at least six inches in
height. The length of the parking stall shall be as indicated in Figure 13-1.



   (F)   Drainage and grading. Except for parking spaces accessory to a
single-family detached dwelling, no area of any parking facility shall have a
slope of more than 5%. No access ramp shall have a slope of more than 12%.
Finished grade and drainage shall be designed by an Illinois Registered
Engineer and approved by the Village Engineer.



   (G)   Lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be in accordance with §
153.192. Illumination of an off-street parking area shall be arranged so as
to deflect light away from adjacent properties and streets.

   (A)   Required spaces. With the exception of single-family,
two-family and townhouse dwellings, in all off-street parking facilities
where parking is provided for employees, visitors or both, parking spaces for
disabled persons shall be provided. The number of accessible parking spaces
shall be included in the total number of required parking spaces and shall be
in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Accessibility
Code, as amended from time to time, and all additional governing codes and
applicable laws.



   (B)   Dimensions and design. Such spaces shall comply with the
design standards presented in the State of Illinois Accessibility Code,
provided that in no instance shall the width of any one space be less than 16
feet. Such spaces shall be identified by a sign  and pavement markings
indicating parking for the disabled only. Such spaces shall be the spaces
closest to the entrance of the building or structure, and shall be connected
by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access.

   (A)   Commercial vehicles.



      (1)   Commercial vehicles parked or stored on property zoned
for non-residential use must be used in the operation of that business on the
property. Commercial vehicles shall be stored in parking areas located to the
rear or side of the property when such parking areas are available.



      (2)   No commercial vehicle shall be parked on any public
right-of-way in a residential district, except for vehicles engaged in
loading or unloading, or vehicles in connection with current work being done
to the adjacent premises.



      (3)   Only standard-sized passenger commercial vehicles
including, but not limited to, automobiles, vans, sports utility vehicles
(SUVs) and pick-up trucks are permitted to be stored or parked outdoors
overnight on residentially-zoned private property. Permitted commercial
vehicles include such vehicles that are owned and used for commercial
purposes by the occupant of a dwelling or guest, provided that the vehicle is
stored or parked in the permitted parking area; such permitted commercial
vehicles may include the logo of the commercial business painted on or
applied to the vehicle. All other commercial vehicles including, but not
limited to, semi-truck tractor units, with or without attached trailers,
commercial trailers, buses, limousines or livery vehicles larger than a
standard-sized passenger vehicle, tow trucks, or construction vehicles are
not permitted to be stored or parked outside overnight on residentially-zoned
property.   



      (4)   No stored or parked commercial vehicle shall be occupied
or used for human habitation.



   (B)   Recreational vehicles. For the purposes of this section,
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES shall include all trailers, campers, motor homes,

enclosed permanent structure. Temporary storage tents for recreational
vehicles shall not be considered such a structure.



         (b)   Recreational vehicles are located in the rear yard
at least three feet from any lot line and are completely screened from view
by a solid wood fence, masonry screen wall or slatted chain link fence at
least six feet in height.



      (3)   No recreational vehicle shall be used for living,
sleeping, or housekeeping purposes in any zoning district.



      (4)   All recreational vehicles shall be maintained in mobile
condition. No recreational vehicle shall be parked or stored in such manner
as to create a dangerous or unsafe condition on the lot where parked or
stored. Parking or storage in such fashion that the recreational vehicle,
whether loaded or not, may tip or roll shall be considered a dangerous and
unsafe condition.



      (5)   This section does not apply to recreational vehicles
offered for-sale in an approved outdoor sales and display area of a motor

§ 153.216  REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.



   (A)   The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided
for the designated uses shall be as follows in Table 13-1: Off-Street Parking
Requirements. Table 13-1 lists parking requirements for the generic uses
listed within the districts. In some cases, uses which are considered part of
a generic use category are listed with specified parking requirements. These
specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this subchapter and do not
indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district.
Certain general uses listed within the districts do not have parking
requirements. These types of uses are not listed within Table 13-1.



   (B)   Parking requirement exemptions in the C-1 District.



      (1)   The first 2,000 square feet in gross floor area for
commercial uses in the C-1 District are exempt from the parking requirements
of Table 13-1. Those commercial uses 2,000 square feet or less in gross floor
area located within a shopping center configuration (i.e., a “strip
mall”) shall not be eligible for this exemption and must provide the
required parking.



      (2)   In the C-1 District, on-right-of-way parking spaces that
are located along the front or side property line may be counted toward
required off-street parking spaces. New on-right-of-way parking spaces may be
created to count toward required off-street parking but must be located along
the side or front property line, and must be accessible 24 hours a day. At
least 50% of the width of an on-right-of-way space must be located along the
property line of the property under consideration in order to count toward
off-street parking requirements. (See Figure 13-6: On-Right-of-Way Parking
and Figure 13-7: On-Right-of-Way Parking Consideration Standard.) These
spaces are not reserved for the establishments that utilize this exemption.

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING



§ 153.230  PURPOSE.



   The landscaping and screening requirements established by this
subchapter are intended to preserve and enhance the appearance, public
health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare of the village by
fostering an aesthetically pleasing development. Proper landscaping
contributes to the village in many ways: enhancing its character and scenic
beauty, providing clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil,
reducing the rate of stormwater runoff, providing nesting areas for birds and
habitat for other wildlife, conserving energy, and providing shade and
windbreaks. These regulations are also intended to increase the compatibility
of adjacent uses, and minimize the adverse impact of noise, dust, motor
vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other
objectionable activities or impacts conducted on, or created by, adjoining or
neighboring uses.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.231  ENFORCEMENT OF LANDSCAPE PROVISIONS.



   (A)   No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for any
lot or use subject to the requirements of this subchapter unless all the
requirements of this subchapter have been fulfilled. Failure to implement the
landscape plan, or to maintain the lot or use in substantial conformance with
the landscape plan, shall be cause for revocation of the occupancy permit
and/or the application of fines and penalties, as established in this Code.
In addition, all landscaping is subject to periodic inspection.



   (B)   If weather prohibits the installation of landscaping at the
time an occupancy permit is applied for, the applicant shall provide the
village with a letter of credit, on forms provided by the village, or cash in
the amount required to complete landscaping installation in order to receive
an occupancy permit, which shall be returned upon completion of required
landscaping.

§ 153.232  LANDSCAPE PLAN.



   (A)   Landscape plan required. A detailed landscape plan shall be
submitted to the village as part of any planned unit development or site plan
review application for townhouse, multi-family, non-residential or mixed-use
development, and must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit.



   (B)   Content of landscape plan.



      (1)   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and
rights-of-way, sidewalks, signs, refuse disposal and recycling areas,
sidewalks, bicycle paths and parking facilities, fences, electrical
equipment, recreational facilities, drainage facilities, and other
freestanding structures, as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator.



      (2)   The location, quantity, size, name and condition, both
botanical and common, of all existing plant materials, including trees and
other material in the right-of-way, and indicating plant material to be
retained and removed.



      (3)   The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical
and common, of all proposed plant material including, but not limited to,
shade and evergreen trees, shrubs, groundcover, annuals/perennials and turf.



      (4)   The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating
contours at one-foot intervals. Proposed berming shall be indicated using
one-foot contour intervals.



      (5)   Elevations of all proposed fences, steps, stairs,
retaining walls both fixed (cast concrete, unitized walls) and any natural
rock outcroppings on the site.



      (6)   Elevations, cross-sections, and other details as
determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator.



   (C)   Minor changes to approved landscape plans. Minor changes to
the landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of
plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan shall be approved
by the Zoning Administrator. Changes to the size and amount of plant
materials of an approved landscape plan shall not be considered a minor
change. Major changes shall be approved by the body granting approval of the
landscape plan initially.

153.999



§ 153.233  SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT MATERIALS.



   (A)   Selection. All planting materials used shall be of good
quality and meet American Association of Nurserymen (AANS) standards for
minimum acceptable form, quality and size for species selected, and capable
to withstand the seasonal temperature variations of northeastern Illinois, as
well as the individual site microclimates. The use of species native to
northeastern Illinois shall be encouraged. Size and density of plant
material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional
criteria that shall be considered when selecting plant material. Where
appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred.



   (B)   Installation. All landscaping materials shall be installed in
accordance with the current planting procedures established by the AANS. All
plant materials shall be free of disease and shall be installed so that soil
of sufficient volume, composition and nutrient balance are available to
sustain healthy growth.



   (C)   Required element. Landscape materials depicted on landscape
plans approved by the village shall be considered to be required site plan
elements in the same manner as buildings, parking and other improvements. As
such, the owner of record, or in some instances the homeowner’s
association, shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement
of all landscape materials, and fences, steps, retaining walls and similar
landscaping elements over the entire life of the development.



   (D)   Maintenance. All landscaping materials shall be maintained in
good condition, shall present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and
shall be  kept free of refuse and debris. Any dead, unhealthy or missing
plants shall be replaced within six months of notification by the village or
the next reasonable available growing/planting season. All fences, steps,
retaining walls and similar landscaping elements required within the
landscaping plan shall be maintained in good repair. The owner of the
premises shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of
all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls and similar
landscaping elements, and refuse disposal areas. Irrigation systems, when
provided, shall be maintained in good operating condition to promote the
health of the plant material and the conservation of water.

153.999



§ 153.234  LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS.



   Landscape plans, as described above, shall be prepared by a licensed
landscape architect, registered in the State of Illinois, and evaluated and
approved based on the following design criteria:



   (A)   Scale and nature of landscape material. The scale and nature
of landscape materials shall be appropriate to the size of the site and
related structures.



   (B)   Selection of plant material. Plant material shall be selected
for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local
conditions.



   (C)   Shade trees. All deciduous shade trees shall have a minimum
trunk size of two inches in caliper at planting, unless otherwise specified.



   (D)   Evergreen trees. Evergreens trees shall have a minimum height
of six feet at planting and shall be incorporated into the landscape
treatment of a site, particularly in those areas where year-round screening
and buffering is required.



   (E)   Ornamental trees. Single stem ornamental trees shall have a
minimum trunk size of three inches in caliper at planting, unless otherwise
specified. Multiple stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum height of
eight feet at planting, unless otherwise specified.



   (F)   Shrubs.



      (1)   Unless otherwise specified, all large deciduous and
evergreen shrubs shall have minimum height of three feet at installation, and
all small deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall have a minimum height of 18
inches at installation.



      (2)   Large shrubs shall be considered to be those shrubs that
reach five or more feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs shall be
considered to be those shrubs that can grow up to five feet in height if left
unmaintained, but are generally kept at heights of 18 to 30 inches.



   (G)   Softening of walls and fences. Plant material shall be placed
intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences and other
barriers to create a softening effect and to help break up long expanses of
blank walls with little architectural detail.



   (H)   Planting beds. Planting beds may be mulched with shredded
hardwood, granite mulch, river rock, feather rocks or similar materials. Lava
rock is not permitted.



   (I)   Irrigation. Landscape design pursuant to the requirements of
this subchapter shall recognize the need for irrigation and water
conservation. Sprinkler irrigation systems may be required for certain
landscaped areas, as determined by a landscape architect. The need for
sprinkler irrigation systems shall be determined by the type of plant
material and the condition/growing medium that they are installed in. For
instance, whether there is a permanent means available to water plant
material, such as hose bibs, shall be a consideration. All irrigation systems
shall be designed to minimize the use of water.



   (J)   Energy conservation. Plant material placement should be
designed to reduce the energy consumption needs of the development. In
addition, landscaping designs shall take into account and make an effort to
implement LEED policy and design standards, where appropriate.



      (1)   Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west
sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.



      (2)   Evergreens and other plant materials should be
concentrated on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect
of winter winds.



   (K)    Species diversity. Diversity among required plant material is
required not only for visual interest, but to reduce the risk of losing a
large population of plants due to disease. Table 13: Diversity Requirements
indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total quantity of
species being used. For instance, if a development requires 45 shade trees,
no more than 18 trees nor less than five trees can be of one species, and
there must be a minimum of five different species within the 45 trees.

be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is
sufficient space and, in particular, when berms and existing topographic
features can be combined with plant material to facilitate effective
screening. Minimum unretained berm side slopes shall be maintained at no less
than a 4:1 slope ratio to prevent erosion and be properly and safely
maintained. Retained slopes may be implemented with the appropriate terracing
necessary to reduce the need for safety railing.

§ 153.237  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   Parking lot landscaping design guidelines. All parking lots of
ten or more spaces are subject to site plan review and a landscape plan as a
condition of obtaining a building permit. Perimeter landscaping is required
for all parking lots and shall be established along the edge of the parking
lot that abuts the public right-of-way, excluding alleys. Interior parking
lot landscaping is required for those lots of ten or more spaces. Nothing in
this section shall be deemed to prevent the applicant’s voluntary
installation of additional interior parking lot landscaping, so long as
parking space requirements and parking lot design requirements are complied
with.



   (B)   Existing parking lots.



      (1)   For existing parking lots that currently do not comply
with the required parking lot landscaping, such landscaping shall be provided
when:



         (a)   A new principal building or building addition is
constructed, or exterior remodeling of the principal building occurs.



         (b)   Over 50% of the total area of an existing parking
lot is reconstructed. Resealing or re-striping of an existing parking lot,
which does not entail paving or resurfacing by replacement of the asphalt or
concrete, shall not be subject to this requirement.



         (c)   When an existing parking lot under 10,000 square
feet in area is expanded by 50% or more in total surface area.



         (d)   When an existing parking lot over 10,000 square
feet in area is expanded by 25% or more in total surface area.



      (2)   When an existing parking lot is required by division
(B)(1) above to provide landscaping, which would result in creating a parking
area that no longer conforms to the parking regulations of this subchapter
and this Code, such existing parking lot shall not be required to install all
or a portion of the required landscaping. The applicant shall be required to
show that landscaping cannot be accommodated on the site. If only certain
requirements are able to be accommodated on the site, those elements shall be
required. The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination that all or a
portion of required landscaping does not have to be installed.

§ 153.238  PARKING LOT PERIMETER LANDSCAPE YARD.



   Perimeter parking lot landscaping provides for the enhancement and
screening of parking lots by requiring a scheme of pedestrian walls and/or
landscaping along public streets. Perimeter landscaping is required for all
parking lots and shall be established along the edge of the parking lot that
abuts the public right-of-way, excluding alleys. The landscape treatment
shall run the full length of the parking lot and shall be located between the
property line and the edge of the parking lot. All perimeter parking lot
screening areas shall be protected with raised concrete curbs. Landscaped
areas outside of shrub and tree masses shall be planted in turf or other
groundcover. The landscaped area shall be improved as follows:



   (A)    One shrub, measuring a minimum of 18 inches at planting and
not to exceed three and one-half  feet at maturity, shall be planted for
every three feet of landscaped area length, spaced linearly to adequately
screen vehicle bumpers. Alternatively, a low pedestrian wall the height of
which provides effective screening to a maximum height of three feet may be
used instead of shrubs. Where feasible, plant materials shall be installed
between the sidewalk and the wall to provide a softening effect on the fence
or wall.



   (B)   The perimeter parking lot landscaping area shall be at least
ten feet in width, as measured from the lot line to the back of curb, in
order to accommodate vehicle bumper overhang and ensure planting areas that
are adequate in size.

§ 153.239  INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.



   For parking lots consisting of ten or more spaces, interior parking lot
landscaping shall be required.



   (A)   Amount. One parking lot island shall be provided between every
ten to 15 contiguous parking spaces. As part of the landscape plan approval,
parking lot island locations may be varied based on specific site
requirements or design scheme, but the total number of islands shall be no
less than the amount required one island for every ten spaces. However, all
rows of parking spaces shall be terminated by a parking lot island or
landscaped area.



   (B)   Size of parking lot islands. Parking lot islands shall be the
same dimension as the parking stall. Double rows of parking shall provide
parking lot islands that are the same dimension as the double row.



   (C)   Design of planting areas. Parking lot islands or landscaped
areas shall be at least 144 square feet in area and at least six inches above
the surface of the parking lot and protected with concrete curbing, except
where designed specifically for the absorption of stormwater. Such islands
and landscaped areas shall be properly drained and irrigated as appropriate
to the site conditions to ensure survivability.



   (D)   Type of landscape material. Shade trees shall be the primary
plant materials used in parking lot islands and landscaped areas. Ornamental
trees, shrubs, hedges and other plant materials may be used to supplement the
shade tree plantings but shall not create visibility concerns for automobiles
and pedestrians.



   (E)   Quantity of landscape material. A minimum of one shade tree
shall be provided for every parking lot island or landscaped area. If the
island extends the width of a double row, then two shade trees shall be
provided.



   (F)   Groundcover. A minimum of 75% of every parking lot island
shall be planted in turf or other live groundcover, perennials or ornamental
grasses.

      (2)   However, a buffer yard is not required where the rear
wall of a commercial building is located on the rear property line or where
an alley is located between a commercial use and a residential use.



   (C)   Buffer yards shall be provided in interior side and rear
yards. Buffer yards may be located within required setbacks, and shall be
reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as
required by this section. No parking, driveways, sidewalks, accessory
buildings or other impervious surfaces are permitted within the buffer yard
area.



   (D)   All plantings in the buffer yard shall be in accordance with
the design standards of this section. The minimum size and improvement of

§ 153.242  SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Refuse disposal dumpsters and refuse storage areas. All refuse
containers shall be fully enclosed on three sides by a solid wood or
simulated wood screen fence, an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick)
or principal structure wall six feet in height and the enclosure shall be
gated. The materials used for screening, including the enclosure, shall
complement the architecture of the principal structure. An extension of an
exterior principal structure wall may be used as one of the screening walls
for a refuse container, provided that such wall meets the minimum six-foot
height requirement and is of the same building materials as the principal
structure. Such wall may not be the gated enclosure.



   (B)   Loading berths. Where feasible, loading berths shall be
located and oriented so as not be visible from the street and adjacent
properties, while still allowing access to the use it is serving. In
addition, loading berths in all zoning districts shall be screened as much as
possible, unless such screening is determined unnecessary by the body
approving the landscape plan. Such screening shall consist of an opaque
masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid wood or simulated wood screen
fence, or dense evergreen hedge, at least six feet in height.



   (C)   Outdoor storage and display areas.



      (1)   Outdoor storage areas. All outdoor storage areas shall
be completely screened by an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick) or
a solid wood or simulated wood screen fence no less than six feet in height.
Where feasible, plant materials shall be installed along the fence or wall
located along the public right-of-way to provide a softening effect. No
materials stored outdoors shall be of a greater height than that of the
required fence or wall.



      (2)   Outdoor sales and display areas.



         (a)   When the rear or interior side yard of an outdoor
display area abuts a residential district, or the rear yard is separated from
a residential district by an alley, the outdoor display area shall be
effectively screened from view by an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or
brick), a solid wood or simulated wood screen fence or dense evergreen hedge,
at least six feet in height.



         (b)   All outdoor display areas shall be designed with a
landscaped yard along the public right-of-way, excluding alleys, a minimum of
ten feet in width and planted with shade or evergreen trees at a rate of one
tree per 25 feet, and supplemented with shrubs and perennials to enhance the
view from the public right-of-way. These screening requirements are not
intended to prohibit openings reasonably necessary for access drives and
walkways.



         (c)   Motor vehicle dealerships or rental establishments
with outdoor sales and display lots shall be designed with permanent
screening along the right-of-way meeting the requirements of division
(B)(2)(b) above, but such plantings may be clustered. However, the screening
may consist of small shrubs and/or a low pedestrian wall of no less than
three feet in height, rather than shade or evergreen trees, to optimize the
view of motor vehicles for sale.



         (d)   Growing areas for nursery stock located in the
front or corner side yard shall be considered to meet screening requirements.



   (D)   Drive-through facility. Drive aisles of drive-through
facilities shall be effectively screened from view along the public
right-of-way and at the edges of sites adjacent to residential properties in
order to minimize the impact of exterior site lighting, headlight glare and
any menu intercom displays.  Such screening shall be approved during the
site plan review process and shall consist of an opaque masonry wall (stone,
stucco or brick), a solid wood or simulated wood screen fence or dense
evergreen hedge at least six feet in height. Plant materials shall be
installed along the fence or wall to provide a softening effect.

SIGNS



§ 153.255  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish a framework for a
comprehensive system of sign controls governing the display, design,
construction, installation and maintenance of signs that will:



   (A)   Promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
village by ensuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding architecture
and land uses.



   (B)   Create a more attractive business and economic climate in the
commercial and industrial areas of the village by enhancing and protecting
the orderly and effective display of signs.



   (C)   Discourage an excessive number of signs and unsightly,
dissimilar and inappropriate signs.



   (D)   Protect the public from hazardous conditions that result from
the indiscriminate use and placement of signs, structurally unsafe signs,
signs which obscure the vision of pedestrians or motorists, and signs which
compete or conflict with necessary traffic signals and warning signs.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.256  SIGN PERMIT REQUIRED.



   Unless specifically permitted as exempt from sign permit requirements
by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, relocate,
or structurally alter any sign or other advertising structure without first
obtaining a sign permit from the village in accordance with § 153.061. The
Zoning Administrator may revoke any sign permit where there has been a
violation of the provisions of this Code or misrepresentation of fact on the
sign permit application.

§ 153.257  LOCATION.



   (A)   No signs, other than those placed by agencies of government or
signs whose placement has been authorized by this subchapter or the Zoning
Administrator, shall be erected on any public property. Any sign placed on
public property without authorization may be removed without notice.



   (B)   No signs shall be placed on any private property without prior
consent of the owner thereof and, where applicable, issuance of a sign permit.



   (C)   All signs within residential districts shall comply with the
view obstruction provisions of § 153.191(G).



   (D)   No sign mounted on the exterior of a building shall cover any
windows, doors or any architectural features.

§ 153.258  SIGN DIMENSION COMPUTATIONS.



   The following principles shall control the computation of sign
dimensions:



   (A)   Computation of sign area. Sign area is calculated as described
in this section.



      (1)   For signs on a background, the entire area of the
background shall be calculated for sign area, including any material or color
forming the sign face or background used to differentiate the sign from the
structure against which it is placed. Sign area does not include any
supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of
the message or sign face. (See Figure 15-1: Sign Area Computation 1.)



   FIGURE 15-1: SIGN AREA COMPUTATION 1







 



      (2)   For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos,
the area of a sign face (“sign area”) is calculated by means of the
smallest square, circle, rectangle or triangle, or combination thereof, that
will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or
other display. Sign area does not include any supporting framework or
bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of



the message or sign face.  Window signs printed on a transparent film and
affixed to a window pane shall be considered freestanding letters or logos,
provided that the portion of the transparent film around the perimeter of the
sign message maintains the transparent character of the window and does not
contain any items in the sign message. (See Figure 15-1: Sign Area
Computation 2.)



   FIGURE 15-1: SIGN AREA COMPUTATION 2







 



      (3)   The sign area of free-form or sculptural (non-planar)
signs is calculated as 50% of the sum of the area of the four vertical sides
of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign. (See Figure 15-1: Sign
Area Computation 3.)



   FIGURE 15-1: SIGN AREA COMPUTATION 3







 



      (4)   For a double-faced sign, if the interior angle between
two sign faces is 45 degrees or less, the sign area is computed as the area
of one face only. If the angle between two sign faces is greater than 45
degrees, the sign area is computed as the sum of the areas of the two faces.



   (B)   Measurement of sign height. Sign height is measured as
described below. When measuring sign height, the height of the entire
structure, including decorative elements, must be included.



      (1)   For monument signs, height shall be calculated as the
vertical distance measured from grade to the highest point of the sign.



      (2)   For signs attached to buildings, height shall be
calculated as the vertical distance from the base of the building to which a
sign is attached to the highest point of the sign.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.259  GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.



   (A)   Construction. All signs constructed, erected, modified or
altered shall comply with the provisions of this subchapter and the
requirements of the Village Code.



   (B)   Sign structure and installation. Supports and braces shall be
an integral part of the sign design. Supports or braces shall be hidden from
public view to the extent technically feasible. All signs attached to a
building shall be installed and maintained so that wall penetrations are
watertight and the structure does not exceed allowable stresses of supporting
materials.



   (C)   Wind pressure and direct load requirements. All signs shall be
designed and constructed to withstand a wind pressure of not less than 30
pounds per square foot of net surface area, and shall be constructed to
receive dead loads as required by the Village Code.



   (D)   Electrical components. All electrical fixtures, devices,
circuits, conduits, raceways or apparatus used to illuminate, move or project
any sign shall be installed and maintained as required in the Village Code.



   (E)   Illumination.



      (1)   Goose-neck reflectors and lights shall be permitted
provided that the reflectors shall concentrate the illumination upon the area
of the sign so as to prevent glare upon the street or adjacent property.



      (2)   All sign illumination shall be designed, located,
shielded and directed so as to prevent the casting of glare or direct light
upon adjacent publicly dedicated roadways and surrounding properties, or
distract operators of vehicles or pedestrians in the public right-of-way. The
light level shall be no greater than one footcandle at any property line.



      (3)   Electronic display screens are prohibited. Time and
temperature signs are not considered an electronic sign and are permitted as
part of a permanent sign.



   (F)   Glass. Glass forming any part of a sign must be safety glass.



   (G)   Lettering. All letters, figures, characters or representations
in cut-out or irregular form, maintained in conjunction with, attached to, or
superimposed upon any sign must be safely and securely built or attached to
the sign structure.



   (H)   Limitation on items of information.



      (1)   All signs must limit the number of items of information
on any single sign face to no more than six items to prevent traffic hazards
for passing motorists and to minimize the cluttered appearance of signs.



      (2)   Each piece of information on a sign shall be defined as
an item of information. For example, each of the following would be defined
as one item of information: a telephone number, the name of the business,
even if multiple words, or the business logo. If the sign advertises products
or services, each product or service would be one item of information. The
street number address of the business is not counted as an item of
information. (See Figure 15-2: Items of Information.)



   FIGURE 15-2: ITEMS OF INFORMATION







 



      (3)   Changeable message signs, where the items of information
are changed manually, are also counted as one item of information. For a sign
that contains a time and temperature component, the time and temperature
component shall not be counted as an item of information.



      (4)   All signs on a zoning lot must be related to goods
and/or services sold or offered on the premises, with the exception of
non-commercial or political signs.



      (5)   Signs for multi-tenant commercial buildings used to
advertise which tenants are located within the development, are limited to
one item of



information per tenant within the development, which may exceed six items, in
addition to the name and address of the development.



      (6)   Directory signs are exempt from the items of information
limitation.



   (I)   Data to be posted. Every sign or other advertising structure
shall have painted on or a metallic sticker applied, in a conspicuous place
thereon, the date of erection, the permit number and the voltage of any
electrical apparatus used in connection therewith. Such information shall not
count toward the limitation on the items of information described in division
(H) above.



   (J)   Sign and premises maintenance.



      (1)   All signs, and the premises surrounding the sign, shall
be maintained in a clean, sanitary and inoffensive condition, and free and
clear of all noxious substances, rubbish and weeds.



      (2)   If any sign or other advertising structure, as defined
herein, is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, or has been
constructed or erected or is being maintained in violation of the provisions
of this subchapter, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately give written
notice to the sign permit holder thereof. If sign permit holder fails to
remove or alter the structure so as to comply with the standards herein set
forth such sign or other advertising structure, as defined in this
subchapter, may be removed by the village at the expense of the sign permit
holder or the owner of the property upon which it is located. The village may
cause any other sign or other advertising structure that is an immediate
peril to persons or property to be removed summarily and without notice.

   (A)   When more than one wall sign, awning or canopy is proposed on
any building with multiple tenants, the applicant shall submit a master sign
plan for review by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   (B)   A master sign plan shall provide for coordinated design for
all building-mounted signage and shall include, at a minimum, criteria and
specifications for general appearance, format of message, font size and
style, lighting, location and construction materials.



   (C)   Where signs are to be located on a wall of a multi-tenant
shopping center, they shall be located at a generally uniform height on the
building wall and shall not cover or overhang any architectural feature.

NONCONFORMITIES



§ 153.280  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming structures, lots and uses, and to specify those circumstances
and conditions under which nonconforming structures and uses shall be
eliminated.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.281  GENERAL STANDARDS OF APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   Authority to continue. Any structure, lot or use that existed
as a lawful nonconformity at the time of the adoption of this Code, and any
building, structure, lot or use that has been made nonconforming because of
the terms of this Code or its subsequent amendments, may continue subject to
the provisions of this subchapter so long as it remains otherwise lawful. A
structure or use that is illegal at the time of the adoption of this Code,
remains illegal if it does not conform with each and every requirement of
this Code.



   (B)   Burden on property owner to establish legality. In all cases,
the burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the
provisions of this Code shall be upon the property owner of the nonconforming
structure, use or lot.



   (C)   Safety regulations. All police power regulations enacted to
promote public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare
including, but not limited to, all building, fire and health codes shall
apply to nonconforming structures.



(Ord. 929, passed 1-25-11; Ord. 1076, passed 1-23-18)



§ 153.282  NONCONFORMING USE.



   (A)   Definition of nonconforming use. A NONCONFORMING USE is the
use of land or a structure that, as of the effective date of this Code, are
used for purposes that are not allowed in the zoning district in which they
are located.



   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance. Normal maintenance and
incidental repair may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole
or in part to a nonconforming use, provided it will not create any new
nonconformity, increase the degree of nonconformity or increase the bulk of
the structure in any manner.



   (C)   Structural alterations. No structural alterations shall be
performed on any structure devoted to a nonconforming use, except in the
following situations:



      (1)   When the alteration is required by law or is necessary
to restore the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official
charged with protecting the public safety.



      (2)   When the alteration is for the purpose of bringing about
a conforming use.



      (3)   When the alteration will not create any new
nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity or increase
the bulk of the structure in any manner.



   (D)   Expansion of use. A nonconforming use of land or a structure
shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged or increased in intensity. Such
prohibited activity shall include, without limitation:



      (1)   Expansion of any structure devoted entirely to a
nonconforming use.



      (2)   An expansion, extension or relocation of a use or its
accessory uses to any land area or structure not currently occupied by such
nonconforming use.



      (3)   An expansion, extension or relocation of such use,
including its accessory uses, within a structure, to any portion of the floor
area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use.



   (E)   Relocation. A nonconforming use of land or a structure shall
not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot
or parcel. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another lot or
parcel if the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which
it is relocated, including all use regulations.



   (F)   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any
use other than one allowed within the zoning district in which it is located.
When such a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to an
allowed use, the whole or part which has been made to conform may not be
changed back to a use that is prohibited. A change of use shall be deemed to
occur when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and another use
has commenced. Any change in use in violation of this Code shall be deemed an
abandonment of the previously existing lawful nonconforming use.



   (G)   Discontinuation or abandonment.



      (1)   If a nonconforming use is discontinued, or the structure
that it occupies becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a continuous
period of 180 days, such use shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not be
reestablished or resumed regardless of the intent to resume or to continue
the use. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall
comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which such land or
structure is located.



      (2)   The period of such discontinuance caused by government

subsequent amendments to the Code no longer conform to applicable setback,

other on-site development standards, such as an insufficient number of
parking spaces, of this Code, are considered NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.



   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance. Normal maintenance and

performed on any nonconforming structure, except in the following situations:

to restore the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official
charged with protecting the public safety.



      (2)   When the alteration will result in eliminating the
nonconformity.



      (3)   When the alteration will not create any new
nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity.

is relocated.



   (F)   Damage or destruction.



      (1)   In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged
or destroyed to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value at that
time, then the structure may not be restored or rebuilt unless the structure,
including foundation is made to conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.



      (2)   When such a structure is damaged or destroyed to the
extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at that time, it may be
repaired and reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities are created
and that the existing degree of nonconformity is not increased. A building
permit shall be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair or
reconstruction within one year of the date of damage or destruction, and the
construction shall be completed within one year of issuance of the building
permit.

   (G)   Extension of walls for nonconforming single-family structures.
Where a legal nonconforming single-family residential structure encroaches
onto the required front, corner side, rear or interior side setback, said
structure may be enlarged or extended vertically or horizontally as defined
by its existing perimeter walls, so long as:



      (1)   The resulting structure does not increase the degree of
the existing nonconformity or otherwise violate this subchapter.



      (2)   If the encroachment is within the interior side setback,
the resulting setback is at least 50% of that which would otherwise be
required.

rear setback, the resulting setback is at least 80% of that which would
otherwise be required.



   (H)   Existing developments deemed conforming for impervious
surface. Lots existing as of January 25, 2011 shall not be considered
nonconforming if they exceed the maximum impervious surface requirement of

parties. If two or more contiguous lots of record are held in common
ownership or owned or controlled by related parties and one or more of the
lots does not meet the requirements for lot area or lot width as established
by this Code, then the lots of record shall be considered to be a single
undivided parcel for purposes of this Code. No portion of the parcel shall be
used, transferred or conveyed which does not meet the lot width and lot area
requirements established by this Code. No division of the parcel shall be
made which leaves the remaining lot(s) with lot width or lot area below the

   (C)   No nonconforming sign shall be altered or enlarged in a way
that increases the nonconformity of the sign. This item in no way precludes
normal maintenance and cleaning.

eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential
losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in
order to accomplish the following specific purposes.



   (A)   To meet the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, § 18g
Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act.



   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;



   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings
from flood damage;



   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;



   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control
projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood
rescue and relief operations;



   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program;



   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 5979, as amended;



   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of
land and water resources; and



   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.

enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank,
a manufactured home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site
for more than 180 days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway use.



   BUILDING PERMIT.  A permit issued by the village for the construction,
erection or alteration of a structure or building.

   CHANNEL.  Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or
artificial depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert,
gully, ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainageway, which has a definite
bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows,
either perennially or intermittently.



   CHANNEL MODIFICATION.  Alteration of a channel by changing the
physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification
includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,

sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions or any alteration of a "historic structure" listed on
the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure.



   SWALE.  A low-lying, natural or graded depressed land area which acts
as a drainageway, but has no definite bed, banks or shorelines, and

prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated
soil conditions. Areas that are restored or created as a result of mitigation
or planned construction projects, and that function as wetlands are included
within this definition, even when all three parameters are not present.

§ 154.03  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, the provisions
expressed herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements, and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the village, and shall not be deemed as a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)



§ 154.04  RESPONSIBILITY.



   The Village Manager or their designee appointed by the President and
Board of Trustees will be jointly (hereinafter designated as Village Manager
or their designee) shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties
listed in this section.



   (A)   To fulfill those duties, the Village Manager or their designee
first should use the criteria listed in § 154.06 to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined
that a site is located within a floodplain, the Village Manager or their
designee must determine whether the development site is within a flood
fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain on no floodway
has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Village
Manager or their designee shall require that the minimum requirements of §
154.52 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Village Manager or their
designee shall require that the minimum requirements of § 154.53 be met. If
the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study
has been completed and approved, the Village Manager or their designee shall
require that the minimum requirements of § 154.54 be met.



   (B)   In addition, the general requirements of § 154.55 shall be
met for all developments meeting the requirements of §§ 154.52, 154.53, or
154.54. The Village Manager or their designee shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of § 154.07.



   (C)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Village
Manager or their designee, Village Engineer, and Zoning Board of Appeals
shall review the requirements of § 154.51 to make sure that they are met. In
addition, the Village Manager or their designee shall complete all
notification requirements.



   (D)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as
required in this section, the Village Manager or their designee may take any
and all actions as outlined in § 154.09.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)



§ 154.05  WETLANDS.



   (A)   Protection of depressional storage.  The storm water storage
capacity in wetlands and in natural storage areas identified in the Flood
Insurance Study (Federal Emergency Management Agency, September 15, 1978), or
latest dated sucessor study, shall be maintained. This storm water storage
capacity shall be maintained on the development site or shall be compensated
within the watershed at a site designated by the Village Manager or their
designee. Storage required to meet the storm water detention criteria of this
chapter shall be provided in addition to the existing identified depressional
storage capacity.



   (B)   Protection of wetlands.  Wetlands shall be protected from the
adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land
developments. In addition to other requirements of this code, the following
mitigation criteria shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows
into wetlands:



      (1)   The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures.



      (2)   All runoff from the development shall be routed through
a preliminary detention/ sedimentation basin designed to capture the
two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being
discharged to an existing wetland. This basin shall be constructed before
property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined herein
should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to
the wetlands.



      (3)   A buffer strip at least 25 feet in width, preferably
vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained around the periphery
of the wetland. (Ord. 95-1942, passed 7-25-95)

of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the village shall be according to the best existing data available in
the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository.



      (1)   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine
SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a
dynamic model such as HIP.



      (2)   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be
obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by
techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States
Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges.



      (3)   Along any water-courses draining more than one square
mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to DNR/OWR for approval. Once
approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain
Information Repository for filing.

development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits
unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)



§ 154.08  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.

the proposed grading of the site and providing storm water detention and
restricted release of storm water will be required for: sites that are to be
subdivided or developed as two or more single-family detached units or more
than two attached dwelling units and are in excess of one acre in size; or
sites that are to be used for nonresidential developments that are in excess
of 0.5 acres; or sites that are to be used for nonresidential developments
for which the square feet of impervious area added by the new development
totals in the aggregate after January 1, 1995, to more than 20,000 square
feet; or sites that are or are to be used for nonresidential developments for
which the sum of the square feet of impervious area of the existing
development plus the impervious area added to the site after January 1, 1995,
exceeds 40% of the area of the site.

§ 154.24  RELEASE RATES.



   Site discharge. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to
control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the less than or
equal to the 100-year, 24-hour event to levels which will not cause an
increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in
aggregate with other development properties and downstream drainage
capacities. The peak discharge from the developed site shall not be greater
than 0.10 cfs per acre developed for events less than or equal to the
100-year event except that when:



   (A)   The sum of the added and existing impervious area does not
exceed 40% but the impervious area added by the new development in the
aggregate after January 1, 1995, is greater than 20,000 square feet; or



   (B)   The sum of the added and existing impervious area exceeds 40%
of lot area but the impervious area added by the new development in the
aggregate after January 1, 1995, is equal to or less than 20,000 square feet.



   (C)   In both cases, the restricted release rate shall be no greater
than 0.1 cfs/acre of site or a greater release rate whichever will produce
the lowest peak discharge from the site over the 24 hours of the 1%
probability storm until the required storage is provided which will equal:



      (1)   One hundred percent of the storm water storage required
for the additional impervious area added by the new development in the
aggregate after January 1, 1995, and



      (2)   Storm water storage equal to storage required for the
existing impervious area multiplied by one or the ratio of the impervious
area added by the new development, divided by the impervious area of the
existing development prior to January 1, 1995, whichever is lower in value.

§ 154.25  WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES.



   (A)   The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse
water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins
shall incorporate design features to capture storm water runoff pollutants.
Detention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout the
property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff, and to
reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.



   (B)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses. Uses
considered compatible with storm water management include open space,
aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields),
wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using
portions of the property exclusively for storm water management.

§ 154.26  HYDROLOGIC DESIGN PROCEDURES.



   The design of the drainage system shall be developed and evaluated by
the applicant based on routing runoff hydrographs for the 2-year, 10-year,
and 100-year, 24-hour events through its minor and major components. In
addition, a general assessment of the impacts of flows exceeding the 100-year
event shall be presented.



   (A)   Rainfall. Unless a contiguous simulation approach to the
drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based
on the Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) Bulletin 70. Third quartile median
point rainfall distribution by Huff of the ISWS shall be assumed for
discharge estimations. SCS Type II distributions shall also be acceptable for
detention basin design.



   (B)   Storm water runoff must be developed as part of the design of
the drainage system's minor and major components. The SCS TR-55, TR-20, ACOE
HEC-1, ISWS ILLUDAS, or other method approved by the Village Manager or their
designee shall be used for the generation of hydrographs, subject to rainfall
distribution modifications for all properties larger than five acres.



   (C)   Antecedent moisture.  All computations of runoff hydrographs
which do not rely on a contiguous accounting of antecedent moisture
conditions shall assume the following antecedent moisture conditions:



      (1)   SCS TR-55 - antecedent moisture condition two; and



      (2)   ILLUDAS - number three, "rather wet".



   (D)   Peak discharges.  The rational formula shall not be used to
estimate peak discharges for properties larger than five acres. Methods which
generate a hydrograph, such as TR-20, TR-55, HEC-1, ILLUDAS, and HIP shall be
used for watersheds larger than five acres.



   (E)   Drainage system evaluation.  Runoff hydrographs must be
developed as part of the evaluation of the drainage system's minor and major
components. Methods such as TR-20, TR-55, HEC-1, ILLUDAS, and HIP are
acceptable evaluation tools.

   A profile and mapping of floodwater depths and coverage shall be
prepared for the property for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year events.
Directions of flow and velocities shall also be reported for critical points
in the drainage system.



   (A)   Detention. Minimum available storage to be provided in a
detention basin shall be based upon the storm water runoff from the 100-year,
24-hour event and reservoir routing (also called level pool), or equivalent.



   (B)   Streets. Detention storage on streets is strongly discouraged,
and will only be allowed after other methods have been exhausted. Detention
storage on streets will then only be allowed according to the following
criteria:



      (1)   Detention storage will only be allowed on collector, or
side streets that do not provide the sole access to an area.



      (2)   Detention storage on streets shall not cause ponding
depths to exceed curb heights by more than one inch, or a total of seven
inches, whichever is lesser. No street shall remain flooded for more than
eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event.



      (3)   The village accepts no liability for any property damage
or personal injury resulting from inundation of any street caused by storing
of storm water detention on the pavement. The developer and the developer's
engineer must provide a letter to the village accepting all such liability.



   (C)   Parking lots. Detention storage will be allowed on parking
lots on private developments according to the following criteria:



      (1)   The maximum ponding depth for parking lots is seven
inches.



      (2)   The village accepts no liability for any property damage

   Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water
pollutants, to be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available for
recreational use.



   (A)   Depths. Wet basins shall be at least eight feet deep (three
feet if aerated), excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish
habitat is to be provided, the pond shall be at least ten feet deep over at
least 25% of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out.



   (B)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet
basin at normal depth shall be equal to, or greater than the runoff volume
from its watershed for the two-year event.



   (C)   Nuisance control. Wet basins shall be designed in a manner
which will reduce as much as practicable nuisance problems such as algae.

§ 154.29 DRY BASINS.



   Dry detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water
pollutants, to be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available for multiple
uses.



   (A)   Drainage basins shall be designed so that 80% of their bottom
area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours after any runoff event
equal to or less than the 100-year event, and after any tailwater affecting
the discharge from the pond recedes. Underdrains directed to the pond outlet
shall be used if necessary to accomplish this requirement.



   (B)   All dry detention basins shall be designed to remove storm
water pollutants. Peak dry detention basin release rate shall be no greater
than 0.10 cfs per acre for all runoff volumes less than or equal to the
runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour rainfall for the developed property.

§ 154.30 SAFETY.



   The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall
be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact
with the system during runoff events.



   (A)   Shorelines.  The shorelines of all detention basins at
100-year capacity shall be as flat as practicable to prevent accidental falls
into the basin, for bank stability, and for ease of maintenance. Pond
shorelines shall have a slope of four to one (horizontal to vertical)
wherever possible, and in no cases be greater than three to one.



   (B)   Banks. Pond bank side slopes shall have a slope of four to one
(horizontal to vertical) wherever possible, and in no cases be greater than
three to one.



   (C)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level
safety ledge extending five feet into the basin from the shoreline and two
feet below the normal water level. The ledge shall be pitched to the
shoreline at 4%.



   (D)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depth of flow.



   (E)   Overflow structures. All storm water detention basins shall be
provided with clearly defined overflow facilities capable of safely passing
overflows so that downstream damage to properties is prevented. The elevation
of the overflow structure shall be at six inches above the high water level
of the basin. The elevations of emergency overflow structure shall be nine
inches above the high water level.

   Infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement
shall only be allowed in soils considered "A" or "B" by the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service. Infiltration practices shall not be located within 75
feet of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling
basin shall be provided, where practicable, to remove coarse sedimentation
from storm water flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches.
Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80% of a
dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The
bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above
seasonally high groundwater and bedrock.

§ 154.32  DETENTION IN FLOODPLAINS.



   The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly
discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood
events. However, the storm water detention requirements of this chapter may
be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the
project site provided the following provisions are met:



   (A)   Detention shall not be permitted in floodways, except for
on-stream detention as discussed in division (C) of this section.



   (B)   The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area
shall require compensatory storage for 1.1 times the volume below the base
flood elevation occupied by the detention basin, including any berms. The
release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled
consistent with the requirements of § 154.24. The applicant shall certify
its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions.  This
should include both the free flow discharge from the basin (no tailwater), as
well as maximum tailwater caused by the floodplain or other sources. All
floodplain storage lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced
below the ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. Excavations for
compensatory storage along streams and watercourses shall be opposite or
adjacent to the area occupied by the detention basin. All compensatory
storage shall be placed in accordance with § 154.52.



   (C)   On-stream detention basins are allowable only if they provide
regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this Code
with respect to water quality and control of the 100-year, 24-hour storm
events from the property. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds
larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic
modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any
properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the
stream as part of on-stream detention:



      (1)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of
water quality or stream aquatic habitat;



      (2)   Shall include a design calling for gradual back slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin;



      (3)   Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Part
708 dated November 29, 1988 and this Code; and



      (4)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish
species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning.

§ 154.33  DETENTION IN WETLANDS.



   Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of storm water
detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in
quality and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat
and water quality. In addition, fill shall not be placed in the wetland and
long-term monitoring and maintenance agreement shall be established to ensure
that the modified wetland/ detention facility continues to provide wetland
functions. Finally, the criteria of § 154.34 shall otherwise be met.

§ 154.34  GENERAL DETENTION CONSIDERATIONS FOR WATER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT.



   Detention basins shall be designed to enhance water quality.



   (A)   Length to width ratio.  All detention basins shall have a
length to width ratio of at least three to one (3:1) as measured along the
longitudinal axis of flow.



   (B)   Inlet and outlet orientation.  As much as feasible, the
distance between inlets to, and outlet from any detention basin should be
maximized. If possible, the inlets and outlet should be at opposite ends of
the basin.



   (C)   Velocity dissipation.  Baffles or berms should be placed
perpendicular to the direction of flow through a detention basin to reduce
velocity and prevent scour.



   (D)   Maintenance. The storm water drainage system shall be designed
to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes should be designed
to allow lawn-mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins should be
provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the
pool for sediment removal. Pre-sedimentation basins should be considered for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment should
be provided.

§ 154.35  PROTECTION OF DEPRESSIONAL STORAGE.



   Existing depressional storage areas in wetlands and identified on the
site topography shall be maintained:



   (A)   Any existing storage volume identified on the site shall be
compensated for on site in addition to any volume required for storm water
detention or filling within the floodplain, and



   (B)   The release rates of the undeveloped site shall be analyzed.
If the existing depressional storage causes storm water to leave the site at
a rate less than 0.10 cfs per acre for the 100-year storm event, the lower
release rates shall be used in designing the detention basin.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)



§ 154.36  IDENTIFICATION OF WETLANDS.



   To determine if wetlands exist on a given site, a wetland investigation
shall be performed by a qualified firm:



   (A)   Any time the National Wetland Inventory Map indicates wetlands
may be present;



   (B)   Existing topography indicates conditions conducive to wetland
formation, such as existing depressional areas; and/or



   (C)   Any time the Village Engineer deems a wetland investigation is
appropriate and necessary.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)



§ 154.37  PROTECTION OF WETLANDS.



   Wetlands shall be protected from the adverse changes in runoff quality
and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other
requirements of this Code, the following mitigation criteria shall be met for
all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands.



   (A)   The existing wetland shall be protected during the
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures.



   (B)   All storm water runoff from the development shall be routed
through a preliminary detention/ sedimentation basin designed to capture the
2-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours before entering an
existing detention pond. The basin shall be constructed before any site
grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined herein should be
followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland.



   (C)   A buffer strip at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated
with native plant species, shall be maintained around the periphery of the
wetland.

§ 154.38  FLOWS FROM TRIBUTARY AREAS.



   Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be
considered in the design of the property's drainage system.



   (A)   Upstream area not meeting Code requirements. When areas exist
upstream of the property that do not meet the storage and release rates of
this Code, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be
explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed:



      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed
for his or her property using the release rates prescribed herein, the
applicant's property area, and the procedures described herein.



      (2)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting
the storage and release rate requirements of this Code, shall be identified.



      (3)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's
property area, allowable release rates shall be determined according to the
criteria detailed in § 154.24.



      (4)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's
property area, and the release rate determined in division (3), above, the
total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed. If
tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover
shall be assumed for the purposes of computing storage.



      (5)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the
village may choose to pay for over sizing the applicant's detention basin to
accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be
limited to the storage for his or her property as computed in division (1)
above. If regional storage is selected by the village, then the design
produced in division (3) above, shall be implemented. If regional storage is
rejected by the village, the applicant has the option of bypassing all
tributary area flows through or around the applicant's basin according to the
procedures detailed in § 154.39. The overflow structure must be designed to
accommodate the maximum bypass flows after the required storage has been
provided.



   (B)   Upstream areas meeting Code requirements. When areas exist
upstream of the applicant's property that meet the requirements of this Code,
the upstream flows shall either be bypassed around, or routed through the
applicant's detention basin at the discretion of the village. Storage needed
for the applicant's property shall still be computed as described above.
However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an
applicant's basin, the final design storm water releases shall be based on
the combined total of the applicant's property plus the tributary area.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)  Penalty, see § 154.99



§ 154.39  BYPASS FLOW.



   If flows from any upstream tributary areas are not to be detained on
the applicant's site in a regional facility, the flows from upstream may
bypass the applicant's site in one of two ways:



   (A)   The flows from upstream may be collected and conveyed around
the applicant's site.



      (1)   The bypass conveyance system shall be separate from the
system used to collect and convey storm water on the applicant's site.



      (2)   The bypass conveyance system must be capable of
conveying the storm water runoff from the 100-year storm without causing
increased flood stages on the applicant's site, or in the areas upstream of
the applicant's site.



      (3)   The point of discharge for the bypass conveyance system
shall be the same as that for the undeveloped site, or as directed by the
Village Engineer.



   (B)   Alternately, the flows from upstream may be passed through the
applicant's storm drainage system.



      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storm water runoff
hydrograph for the site, without considering any bypass flows.



      (2)   The applicant shall then compute the storm water
hydrograph for the total watershed, including all upstream tributary areas.



      (3)   The outlet structure controlling discharge from the
detention basin shall be designed as follows:



         (a)   The orifice, or other type restrictor shall be
sized to release no more than the maximum allowable release rate for the
site, as described in § 154.24. The runoff hydrograph from the site for the
100-year storm shall then be routed through the detention basin to determine
a high water level, not considering any bypass flow.



         (b)   An overflow spillway, or other outlet structure
shall be designed to discharge flow from the detention basin when the water
level rises to a level higher than that determined in division (B)(3)(a)
above. The maximum discharge rate for this outlet structure shall be the
difference of the two runoff hydrographs determined in divisions (B)(1) and
(2) of this section.

§ 154.40  EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.



   Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be
used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be completed
as part of the mass grading for the site. No construction will be allowed
beyond the mass grading until the detention, retention, or depressional
storage areas are complete. This is to ensure that if soil erosion and
sediment control practices are not adequately implemented, any eroded
sediment will be captured in these areas and will have to be removed by the
applicant before project completion.

§ 154.41  MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.



   (A)   Maintenance.  Maintenance of storm water drainage facilities
located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that
property. Before the appropriate permit is obtained from the village the
applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the village guaranteeing
that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its
storm water drainage system.



      (1)   The maintenance agreement shall also specifically
authorize representatives of the village to enter onto the property for the
purpose of inspections of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be
recorded with the recorder of deeds of Cook County. The maintenance agreement
shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the
property's storm water drainage system and shall provide for access to the
system for inspection by authorized personnel of the village. The maintenance
agreement shall also stipulate that if the appropriate authorized personnel
of the village notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems
which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections
within 30 calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made
within this time period the village may have the necessary work completed and
assess the cost to the property owner.



      (2)   The village has the option of requiring a bond to be
filed by the property owner for maintenance of the storm water drainage
system.



      (3)   Inspections during construction.  General site grading
shall not begin until the village has certified in writing to the applicant
that any necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The
village will also conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress to be
certain that the drainage system is being built as designed. If any
violations of the provisions or requirements of this chapter are noted during
such inspections the village shall notify the property owner in writing of
the items needing correction. The property owner shall have ten calendar days
to make such corrections unless given a specific extension of time in writing
by the village. Failure to complete such corrections within the specified
time period shall constitute a violation of this chapter.



      (4)   Final inspection. Upon notification by the applicant
that the drainage system is completed, the village shall conduct a final
inspection. If the drainage system is found to contain deficiencies which
require correction the village shall notify the property owner of the
necessary corrections. The property owner shall correct such deficiencies
within ten calendar days unless given a specific extension of time in writing
by the village. Failure to make necessary corrections within the specified
time period shall constitute a violation of this chapter.  Upon finding that
the drainage system meets the provisions and requirements of this chapter the
village shall issue in writing a notice of drainage system completion to the
property owner.



      (5)   Routine inspections. All privately owned drainage
systems shall be inspected by representatives of the village not less often
than once per year. A written report shall be filed of the results of any
inspection and a copy sent to the property owner detailing any problems which
need correction. The property owner shall correct such deficiencies within
ten calendar days unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the
village. Failure to make necessary corrections within the specified time
period shall constitute a violation of this chapter.



   (B)   The cost for the above inspections shall be the responsibility
of the property owner. In addition to village staff costs the village
inspection may require the use of professional services to complete. The
property owner shall reimburse to the village the reasonable cost it incurs
in using for its staff time plus such professional services rendered by its
consultants, within ten days after the submission of the bill by the village.
Consultants shall include, without limitation, the persons who provide the
village with advice in the fields of engineering, or law.

§ 154.42  FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION.



   If because of the small size of a site, or other mitigating
circumstances, at the village's discretion, a fee may be paid to the village
in lieu of providing the required detention.



   (A)   Any development requiring a restrictor smaller than one inch
in diameter to satisfy the release requirements § 154.24 may be required to
pay a fee. The fee would be equal to:



   = ($150,000.) x (Theo. Vol.- Act. Vol.)



where the "Theoretical Volume" is the detention storage calculated using the
maximum allowable release rate per § 154.24, the "Actual Volume" is the
detention storage calculated using the release rate from a one inch diameter
restrictor, and the volumes are measured in acre-feet. The village shall also
have the option of requiring a fee for each acre-foot of detention storage
needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on-site, provided the
property will discharge storm water to the village's storm sewer system.



   (B)   In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale
can be achieved, it may be permissible, and may be required, for the adjacent
properties to utilize a common regional detention basin. The applicant may
have the option of paying a fee based upon the ratio of acre-feet required
for the site to the total capacity of the regional facility, and reflecting
the cost of engineering, land, construction, landscaping, and maintenance of
the detention facility so that the village can build regional facilities or
applicants can jointly build the necessary facilities themselves.

   The Village Manager or their designee shall be responsible for the
general administration and enforcement of this chapter which shall include
the following:



   (A)   Determining the floodplain designation. Check all new
development sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard
Area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.



   (B)   Professional engineer review. If the development site is
within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be
referred to a registered professional engineer under the employ or contract
of the village for review to ensure that the development meets §§ 154.53 or
154.54. In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E. shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of § 154.53.



   (C)   Dam safety requirements. Ensure that a DNR/OWR permit has been
issued or a letter indicating no permit is required, if the proposed
development activity includes construction of a dam as defined in § 154.02.
Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment
structures.



   (D)   Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required
federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit.



   (E)   Plan review and permit issuance.  Ensure that all development
activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the

§ 154.51  VARIANCES.



   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a
regulatory floodway as defined in § 154.02. However, when a development
proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway, and whenever the
standards of this section place undue hardship on a specific development
proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a
variance. The Zoning Board shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees.



   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
SFHA;



      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance
were not granted;



      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;



      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health,
safety, beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or
creation of a nuisance;



      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood
protection, lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief
operations, policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities,
or other public facilities;



      (6)   The provisions of §§ 154.52 through 154.54 shall still
be met;



      (7)   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;



      (8)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not
represent a general problem; and



      (9)   The granting of the variance will not alter the
essential character of the area involved, including existing stream uses.



   (B)   The Village Manager or their designee shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of § 154.54 that
would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;



      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of
these risks, and that the applicant will acknowledge in writing that he or
she assumes the risk and liability.



   (C)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site
or building listed on the Natural Register of Historical Places or documented
as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of this section,
subject to the conditions that:



      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and



      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic structure.

§ 154.52  OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.



   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions
of this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the
capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the
flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the
requirements of § 154.55.



   (A)   Development permit. No person, firm, corporation, or
governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in
the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Village
Manager or their designee.



   (B)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Village Manager or their designee. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M.S.L.,
1929 adj. datum or N.G.V.D. and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and
additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on
the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements
of § 154.55.



   (C)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Village
Manager or their designee shall compare the elevation of the site to the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land
that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current
Flood Insurance Rate Map and which has not been filled after the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a permit as required by this
chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of
this chapter. The Village Manager or their designee shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.



   (D)   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas
shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of
grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to
be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.



   (E)   The Village Manager or their designee shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for
this type of activity. The Village Manager or their designee shall not issue
a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been
obtained.



   (F)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood
fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.



   (G)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient
data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of
removing the site from the floodplain.



   (H)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and
one-tenth times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse.

      (14)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be
submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the permit criteria of
division (D) of this section.



      (15)   If the designated floodway delineation, base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project,
the application will not be considered complete until DNR/OWR has indicated
conditional approval of the designated floodway map change. No structures may
be built until a letter of map revision has been approved by FEMA.



      (16)   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by

Registered Professional Engineer, under the employ or contract of the village
shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section.



   (D)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses.
The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate
uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will
not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the
natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or
permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction
impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in
this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part
708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:



      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public
works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding,
erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.



      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or
requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment
facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating,
commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;



      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;



      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;



      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems, including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from
any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and
including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that
will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;



      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable
accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway
storage;



      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways,
runways and taxiways and any modification thereto;



      (8)   Parking lots and any modification thereto (where depth
of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot
and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevations. The
applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot, formally
agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts
liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events;



      (9)   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse;



      (10)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing
lawful structures including the construction of water-tight window wells,
elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the
existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to
the structure;



      (11)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged
building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the
building was damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood
protection elevation;



      (12)   Modifications to an existing building that would not
increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency
flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not
limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story
additions. If the building improved to 50% or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building
will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.



      (13)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, building additions, buildings on stilts,
excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise
non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or
planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as
specifically defined above as an appropriate use.



   (E)   Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway
maps designated by DNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be
considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following
engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer
and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of §
154.55:



      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase
flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert
crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway
conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up
to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective
designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration:



         (a)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" =
(1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the
effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to
the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959,
McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York).



         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for
both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement
with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed
conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative
to a non-vegetative land cover.



         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to DNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that
more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:



            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section
to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's
length.



            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to
a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.



            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a
vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten
feet of stream length shall be used.



            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between
cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the
designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties.



            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations
shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.



      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any
designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of
fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control
projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least one and one-half times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a
bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory designated
floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation
and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage
lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above
the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be
placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer
shall demonstrate to DNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and
water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically
equivalent. Finally there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.



      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to
increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except
bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway
velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event. In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or
flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour,
erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other
design measures.



      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and
roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls
or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will
increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must
contact DNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.



         (a)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages
must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood
elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
154.06. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart
for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the
U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways
calculation procedures.



         (b)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per
division (E)(2) of this section.



         (c)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division
(E)(3) of this section.



         (d)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water
that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an DNR/OWR permit
must be received.



         (e)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by
the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile
must be submitted to DNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by
division (D) of this section.



         (f)   All excavations for the construction of the
crossing shall be designed per division (E)(8) of this section.



      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges,
culverts, and approach roads.



         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach
reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1
foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood
frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure
is not a source of flood damage.



         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway
approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the
upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility
of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into
consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.



         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the
existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must
be prepared in accordance with 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 (Floodway
Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to DNR/OWR for review
and concurrence before a permit is issued.



      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must
be obtained from DNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment
structures as defined in § 154.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of
92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:



         (a)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public
interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional
stormwater detention;



         (b)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;



         (c)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to
degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should
include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a
pre-sedimentation basin.



         (d)   A non-point source control plan has been
implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment
runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals,
and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream
watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should
coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed
control;



         (e)   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of this section.



      (7)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and
commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside
dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the
floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the
outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not
be required for floodproofing activities.



      (8)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed
in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to
and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate
for lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency:



         (a)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a
wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate
of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length;



         (b)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a
narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's
length; and



         (c)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.



         (d)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland
upstream and downstream of the transition sections.



      (9)   If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:



         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the
activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural
conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include
levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of
structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or
the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel
modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions
and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;



         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural
functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no
significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the
replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;



         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and
will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the
natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the
following criteria:



            1.   The physical characteristics of the modified
channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in
length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been
previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should
be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.



            2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be
provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed
such that they will prevent erosion.



            3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be
used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be
limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading
and stabilization effects of the vegetation.



            4.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be
limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.



            5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a
side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are
no practicable alternatives.



            6.   All disturbed areas associated with the
modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon
completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall
be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of
the vegetative cover.



            7.   If the existing channel contains considerable
bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features,
such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting
areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be
established, where appropriate.



            8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the
downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of
downstream water quality.



            9.   New or relocated channels should be built in
the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be
completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel.



            10.   There shall be no increases in stage or
velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency
flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an
increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control
project.



            11.   Unless the modification is for a public
flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of
floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and



            12.   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of this section.



      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities
located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by
the applicant.



      (11)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all
activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in
which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and
sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the
following criteria:



         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to
preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to
minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the
existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15
days prior to the initiation of improvements.



         (b)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization
shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil
stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached
on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not
be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.



         (c)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed
before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent
the movement of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel. Potential
sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check
dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins.



         (d)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in
width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along
existing channels (see division (E)(15) of this section). Construction
vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall
be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction
in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.



         (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures
shall be designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards
for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988) also
known as the Green Book and The Illinois Urban Manual (NRCS, 1995).



      (12)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met
if the applicant can demonstrate to DNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or
easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event.



      (13)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.



         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the
designated floodway study, referenced in § 154.06, must be used for analysis
of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or
conditions have changed, DNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and
concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.



         (b)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at
the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a
downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed
construction shall be shown to meet: The requirements of this section for the
100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions and
conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.



         (c)   If the applicant learns from DNR/OWR, local
governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or
culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional
flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or
modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be
analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the
existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the
bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.



      (14)   Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate
use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the
100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DNR/OWR and
FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from DNR/OWR a
conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is
issued. The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until
as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or
excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and DNR/OWR. In the
case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and
the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional
designated floodway map revision before DNR/OWR approval can be given. No
filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional
approval is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating,
no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from DNR/OWR.



      (15)   Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering
analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered
professional engineer.



      (16)   For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be
met:



         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be
preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the
channel.



         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer
strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip
shall be established upon completion of construction.



      (17)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map
revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may
proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map
is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated
floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DNR/OWR and
FEMA of the "as-built" plans.



   (F)   State review. For those projects listed below located in a
designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DNR/OWR for
their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit.



      (1)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a
proposed bridge pursuant to division (E)(4) of this section.



      (2)   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or
culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating
the proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (E)(5) of this section.



      (3)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically
equivalent storage pursuant to division (E)(1), (2), and (8) of this section.



      (4)   The construction of any DNR/OWR projects, dams (as
defined in § 154.02) and all other state, federal, or local units of
government projects, including projects of the municipality or county.



      (5)   An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge
affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a
smaller opening.



      (6)   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or
flood profiles.



      (7)   Projects in public bodies of water.



   (G)   Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this
chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation
that a permit is not required from DNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615,
Act 5, § 5 et seq. No permit from DNR/OWR shall be required if DNR/OWR has
delegated this responsibility to the village.



   (H)   Permits for dams.  Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a dam as defined in § 154.02 per 92 Ill. Adm.
Code Part 702 (Rules for Construction of Darns) shall obtain an DNR/OWR
permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Village Manager or
their designee finds a dam that does not have an DNR/OWR permit, the Village
Manager or their designee shall immediately notify the DNR/OWR Schaumburg
office. If the Village Manager or their designee finds a dam which is
believed to be in unsafe condition, the Village Manager or their designee
shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the DNR/OWR Schaumburg office,
and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).



   (I)   Activities that do not require a registered professional
engineer's review.  The following activities may be permitted without a
registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet
the other requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.



      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities that:



         (a)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground
elevations;



         (b)   Do not require the placement of above ground
structures in the floodway;



         (c)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the
top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the
existing streambed;



         (d)   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above
the estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low
chord of an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No
supporting towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so
as to not catch debris.



         (e)   Disturbance of streamside vegetation prevent
erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the stream
banks shall be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise
stabilized upon completion of construction.



         (f)   A utility crossing carrying material which may
cause water pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act, ILCS
Ch. 415, Act 5 (1992 State Bar Edition) shall be provided with shut-off
valves on each side of the body of water to be crossed.



         (g)   All Illinois Commerce Commission, National
Electric Safety Codes, and federal requirements for clearance must be met.



      (2)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls that:



         (a)   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the
existing adjacent natural bank slope;

and



         (c)   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at
the outfall location.



      (3)   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding
fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.



      (4)   Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:

         (b)   Materials are not placed higher than the existing
top of bank;



         (c)   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the
cross-sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake; and



         (d)   Stabilization utilizing native vegetation and
gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion
problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action
necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil
bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions
should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.



      (5)   Temporary stream crossings in which:



         (a)   The approach roads will be one- half foot or less
above natural grade.

§ 154.54  OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED.



   In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and Unnumbered A Zones)
where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more
than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative
effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase
the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.



   (A)   Development permit.  It shall be unlawful for any person,
firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall
commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Village Manager or their designee. Application
for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Village
Manager or their designee. The application shall be accompanied by drawings
of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; and existing
grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location
and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the
elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings
subject to the requirements of § 154.55.  The application for a development
permit shall also include the following information:



      (1)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its
purpose, and intended use;



      (2)   Site location (including legal description) of the
property, drawn to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether
it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;



      (3)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of
activity;



      (4)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which
include as a minimum:



         (a)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity,
name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the
site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow;



         (b)   A plan view of the project and engineering study
reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions
of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment)
datum or N.G.V.D., adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood
control easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel
(when the proposed construction is in or near a commercially navigable body
of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross-sections,
north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale;



         (c)   Cross-section views of the project perpendicular
to the flow of floodwater and engineering study reach showing existing and
proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in
plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year
frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical
or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and



         (d)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for
disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of
grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to
be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.



      (5)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be
submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of division
(D) of this section.



      (6)   Any and all other federal, state, and local permits or
approvals that may be required for this type of development.



   (B)   Based on the best available existing data according to the
Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository, the Village
Manager or their designee shall compare the elevation of the site to the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information
exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation
according to § 154.06(D). Any development located on land that can be shown
to have been higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map Identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. The Village Manager or their
designee shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior
to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.



   (C)   The Village Manager or their designee shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for
this type of activity. They shall not issue the development permit unless all
required federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.



   (D)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA,
where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to
public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and
hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water
quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by
appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.



   (E)   Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been
determined, the following standards shall apply:



      (1)   The developer shall have a registered professional
engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations,
and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of §
154.53(E)(1) through (11) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of § 154.06(D).  As an alternative, the developer should have an
engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that
engineering study to DNR/OWR for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon
acceptance of the floodway by DNR/OWR, the developer shall then demonstrate
that the project meets the requirements of § 154.53 for the designated
floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in §
154.02.



      (2)   A development permit shall not be issued unless the
applicant first obtains a permit from DNR/OWR or written documentation that a
permit is not required from DNR/OWR.



      (3)   No permit from DNR/OWR shall be required if DNR/OWR has
delegated permit responsibility to the village per 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part,
Part 708 for designated floodways.



      (4)   Permits for dams. Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a dam as defined in § 154.02 per 92 Ill. Adm.
Code Part 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an DNR/OWR permit
prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Village Manager or their
designee finds a dam that does not have a DNR/OWR permit, the Village Manager
or their designee shall immediately notify the DNR/OWR Schaumburg office. If
the Village Manager or their designee finds a dam which is believed to be in
an unsafe condition, the Village Manager or their designee shall immediately
notify the owner of the dam, the DNR/OWR Schaumburg office, and the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).



      (5)   The following activities may be permitted without a
Registered Professional Engineer's review or calculation of a base flood
elevation and designated floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter:



         (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:



            1.   Do not result in any increase in existing
ground elevations;



            2.   Do not require the placement of above ground
structures in the floodway;



            3.   In the case of underground stream crossings,
the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the
existing streambed;



            4.   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed
above the estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the
low chord of an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No
supporting towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so
as to not catch debris.



            5.   Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be
kept to minimum during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation.



            6.   A utility crossing carrying material which
may cause water pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act,
ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5 (1992 State Bar Edition), shall be provided with shut-off
valves on each side of the body of water to be crossed.



            7.   All Illinois Commerce Commission, National
Electric Safety Codes, and federal requirements for clearance must be met.



         (b)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls that:



            1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the
existing adjacent natural bank slope;



            2.   Do not result in an increase in ground
elevation; and



            3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream
erosion at the outfall location.



         (c)   Construction of shoreline and streambank
protection that:



            1.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length.



            2.   Materials are not placed higher than the
existing top of bank.



            3.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the
cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than 10%.



            4.   Stabilization utilizing native vegetation and
gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion
problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action
necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil
bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions
should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.



         (d)   Temporary stream crossings in which:



            1.   The approach roads will be one-half foot or
less above natural grade.



            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass
without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above
any drainage tile or outfall invert.



            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel
will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the
channel shall be non-erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.



            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or
otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon
removal of construction.



            5.   The access road and temporary crossings will
be removed within one year after authorization.



         (e)   The construction of light poles, sign posts and
similar structures;



         (f)   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic
fields (excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at
grade;



         (g)   The construction of properly anchored, unwalled,
open structures such as playground equipment, pavilions, and carports built
at or below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of flood waters;



         (h)   The placement of properly anchored buildings not
exceeding 70 square feet in size, nor ten feet in any one dimension (e.g.,
animal shelters and tool sheds);



         (i)   The construction of additions to existing
buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which
are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and
which do extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel
to the flow of flood waters;



         (j)   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel
where:



            1.   The affected length of stream is less than
1,000 feet.



            2.   The work is confined to re-establishing flows
in natural stream channels, or



            3.   The cross-sectional area of the dredged
channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of
the site.



      (6)   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or
relocated watercourse shall be maintained.



   (F)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and
one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In
the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)  Penalty, see § 154.99



§ 154.55  PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS.



   In addition to the requirements found in §§ 154.52, 154.53 and 154.54
for development in flood fringes, designated floodways, and SFHA or
floodplains where no floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO, AH, AE,
A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M, E, D, or X), the following requirements
shall be met.



   (A)   Public health standards.



      (1)   No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or
storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers,
flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below
the flood protection elevation (FPE).



      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells,
sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted
providing all manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE
are watertight.



      (3)   Larger area roof and lot drainage. Drainage from roofs
and paved parking or other areas larger than 40,000 square feet along any
street shall be stored temporarily on the premises, in retention ponds, on
roofs or at ground level or otherwise, which storage areas shall be equipped
with outlets that may be set or regulated to empty slowly the stored runoff
water into storm sewers or surface channels according to their ability to
handle the flow safely.



      (4)   Roof drainage disposal on lawns. Roof drainage through
downspouts or otherwise shall not be connected directly to any street or
public sewer (storm, sanitary or combined) but shall be directed away from
the building onto the lawn or yard or into a seepage well.



      (5)   Foundation footing drainage. Foundation footing drainage
shall not be disposed of in a street or public sanitary or combined sewer,
but may be disposed of in a seepage well or pumped out away from the building
onto the lawn or yard.



   (B)   Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving
channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition,
the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the
issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.



   (C)   Protecting buildings. All buildings located within a 100-year
floodplain also known as a SFHA, and all buildings located outside the
100-year floodplain but within the 500-year floodplain, shall be protected
from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. This building
protection criteria applies to the following situations:



      (1)   Construction or placement of a new building;



      (2)   Substantial improvement to an existing building as
defined in § 154.02, including an increase to the first floor area by more
than 20%.  This alteration shall be figured cumulatively beginning with any
alteration which has taken place subsequent to April 1, 1990;



      (3)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirements
does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and



      (4)   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days.



   (D)   This building protection requirement may be met by one of the
following methods.



      (1)   A residential or non-residential building, when allowed,
may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following:



         (a)   The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at
or above the flood protection elevation.



         (b)   Fill requirements. The fill shall be placed in
layers no greater than one foot deep before compaction and should extend at
least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the
flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood
protection elevation. However, the ten foot minimum may be waived if a
structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building
from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected
against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or
surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.



      (2)   A residential or non-residential building may be
elevated in accordance with the following:



         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on
crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently
open to flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be
no more than one foot above existing grade, and consists of a minimum of two
openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the
base flood elevation.



         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be
anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so
as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves,
ice and floating debris.



         (c)   All areas below the flood protection elevation
shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor
(including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and
air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above
the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and
telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the flood protection elevation.



         (d)   The areas below the flood protection elevation may
only be used for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement.



         (e)   Manufactured homes, and travel trailers to be
installed on a site for more than 180 days, shall be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation; and, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the Rules
and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to
77 Ill. Adm. Code Part 870. In addition, all manufactured homes shall meet
the following elevation requirements:



            1.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in
a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial
damage from a flood, the top of the lowest floor shall be elevated to or
above the flood protection elevation.



            2.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,
the manufactured home shall be elevated so that either the top of the lowest
floor is above the base flood elevation or the chassis is at least 36 inches
in height above grade and supported by reinforced piers or other foundations
of equivalent strength, whichever is less.



         (f)   Recreational vehicles or travel trailers shall be
required to meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of division
(C)(2)(e) of this section unless:



            1.   They are on site for fewer than 180
consecutive days.



            2.   They are fully licensed and ready for highway
use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels
or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utility and service devices, and has no permanently attached additions.



            3.   Only a non-residential building may be
structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that: a
registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been
structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, the
structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The
building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of
rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and
impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without
human intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees,
berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the
purpose of this subsection).



            4.   Existing buildings located within a
designated floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use
standards included in § 154.53. Non-conforming structures located in a
designated floodway may remain in use and may only be enlarged, replaced or
structurally altered in accordance with § 154.53(D). A non-conforming
structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or man-made disaster
may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50% of its market value before it
was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this chapter.



(Ord. 801, passed 7-26-05)  Penalty, see § 154.99



§ 154.99  PENALTY.



   Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a
variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon
due investigation, the Village Manager or their designee may determine that a
violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exits. The Village Manager
or their designee shall notify the owner in writing of such a violation.



   (A)   If such owner fails to correct the violation after ten days'
notice:



      (1)   The village may make application to the Circuit Court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter, or make such other
order as the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.



      (2)   Any person or persons who violate this chapter shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than $50, nor more than $1,000 for
each offense.



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.



      (4)   The village shall record a notice of violation on the
title to the property.



   (B)   The Village Manager or their designee shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and, therefore, may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.



      (1)   The Village Manager or their designee is authorized to
issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The
stop-work order shall be in writing, shall indicate the reason for the
issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the
circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes
a suspension of the permit.



      (2)   No site development permit shall be permanently
suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall
state: the grounds for compliant or reasons for suspension or revocation; and
the time and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be
given an opportunity to present evidence on his or her behalf. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine
whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.



   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
