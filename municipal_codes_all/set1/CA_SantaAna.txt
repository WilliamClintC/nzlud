PREFACE 
This Code is a revision and codification of all Ordinances of a general and permanent nature which were deemed advisable to be retained. 
This Code is an entire new ordinance, and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all previous ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. This Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them or relating to special purposes, such as the ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. All the ordinances have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances completely rewritten. New words and phrases and even whole sections have been added to make this Code comprehensive in scope and lucid in meaning. 
As it will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged under applicable titles and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws. 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 16 is 16-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections, that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5, is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fractional number after the chapter number, i.e., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12½. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
All historical citations of a section herein where such citation is to a section of the 1952 Santa Ana Municipal Code which has been amended, the section number changed by amendment, or the section added by amendment; the code section number indicated is the number assigned in the amendatory ordinance; e.g. "Code 1952, § 3317; Ord. No. NS-00", where an ordinance number 00 of the new series may have repealed a Section 3217 and enacted a Section 3317 in lieu thereof, the original section number 3217 is not indicated. 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the innovation of the looseleaf system of binding and up-keep servicing of the ordinances. With this new looseleaf system, the Code of Ordinances will be kept up-to-date continuously. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page affected reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting and deleting the obsolete pages. To each such amendment will be attached an editorial footnote explaining briefly the effect of the amendment on the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintaining of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing the same, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The general index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Time and effort have not been spared in the preparation of this Code and the publishers are most grateful to Joseph W. Fletcher, City Attorney, and Ms. Patricia E. Healy, Clerk of the Council, for their cooperation and untiring efforts during the progress of the editorial work. 
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Zanne Ebersole, Editor, and Aline True, Quality Control Specialist, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. 
This Code of Ordinances is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of Santa Ana.

(b)  Recovery of attorneys' fees authorized. The prevailing party in any judicial action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding to abate a nuisance may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, provided that the city elected, at the initiation of such individual action or proceeding, to recover its own attorneys' fees. In no judicial action or administrative proceeding shall an award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the city in the judicial action or administrative proceeding. A judicial action includes, but is not limited to, any civil or criminal action, inspection or abatement warrant, administrative proceeding, or appeal from an administrative proceeding. "Abatement" shall include any action taken by the city to cause or otherwise obtain compliance with this municipal code or other codes, as specified herein, even if the violation is ultimately corrected by the violator. Any recovery of attorneys' fees for abatement of a nuisance shall be in accordance with this section.

c.  The hearing officer shall only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the violation occurred and whether the responsible person has caused or maintained the violation of the municipal Code on the date(s) specified in the administrative citation. 
d.  The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall be given the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the administrative citation.

g.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional information from the issuing officer/employee or the recipient of the administrative citation prior to issuing a written decision. 
(5)  Hearing officer's decision. After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer may immediately issue a verbal decision or may issue a written decision within ten (10) days of the hearing. The decision shall include the reasons for the decision and such decision shall be final. If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be upheld, then the fine amount on deposit with the city shall be retained by the city. If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be canceled and the fine was deposited with the city, then the city shall promptly refund the amount of the deposited fine. 
(6)  Collection of unpaid fines. Failure to pay the assessed administrative fine within fifteen (15) days or such other time limit set forth in the administrative citation, and/or has not been successfully challenged by a timely appeal as provided in section 1-21.9, this obligation shall constitute a special assessment and/or lien against the real property on which the violation occurred. The special assessment and/or lien shall be imposed pursuant to the procedure set forth in Chapter 17, Article III of this Code. Alternatively, the matter may be referred for collection, which includes but is not limited to the filing of a small claims court action. 
(Ord. No. NS-2423, § 3, 4-17-00)  
Sec. 1-21.9. - Right to judicial review. 
Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may obtain judicial review of such decision by filing an appeal to be heard in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange within twenty (20) days of the decision or service thereof. Such appeal shall be filed in the Central Justice Center located at 700 Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana, California and shall be completed pursuant to California Government Code section 53069.4.

Each city department will supplement the EOP with those standard operating procedures necessary to fulfill their role in an emergency under the EOP. 
The EOP shall comply with the principles of the Orange County Operational Area Agreement, the California Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) and the federal National Incident Management System (NIMS).

Sec. 2-404. - Emergency proclamations and measures. 
A.  Proclamations of local emergency. A local emergency, as defined by section 2-401 and by California Emergency Services Act Section 8558(c), may be proclaimed upon conditions of disaster or extreme peril, existing or imminently likely, so as to threaten lives and property, and by reason of its magnitude is or is likely to be beyond the control of the available services, personnel, equipment and facilities of the city. 
The director of emergency services may request the city council to proclaim the existence of a local emergency, if the city council is in session, or may issue such proclamation if the city council is not in session. Such proclamation must be made within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the disaster or emergency. Whenever a local emergency is proclaimed by the director, the city council must, within seven (7) days from the date of the original proclamation by the director, approve a resolution ratifying the proclamation, or allow the proclamation to expire. City council shall review the need for continuing the local emergency at least once every thirty (30) days and shall terminate the emergency or allow it to expire at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant. 
During a local emergency, the city council or the director of emergency services may promulgate ordinances, orders or regulations necessary to provide for the protection of life and property, including orders or regulations imposing a curfew within designated boundaries where necessary to preserve the public order and safety. Such orders and regulations and amendments and rescissions thereof shall be in writing and shall be given widespread publicity and notice. 
The city council shall proclaim the termination of the local emergency at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant. Upon termination of the local emergency, any such rules, regulations, orders and directives or suspensions thereof prepared under the proclamation of local emergency shall terminate and have no further force or effect. 
B.  Initial emergency measures. All emergency measures taken by the director of emergency services prior to the issuance of an official proclamation of emergency, or prior to any decision by the city council not to issue such proclamation, shall be deemed conclusively to be for the direct protection and benefit of the inhabitants and property of the city and shall be legal and binding on the city. The director of emergency services shall be immune from any form of liability for all emergency measures taken pursuant to an official proclamation of emergency made by the director prior to a decision by the city council, even if the city council later decides not to ratify the director's proclamation of emergency. 
C.  Emergency expenditures. Any expenditure made in connection with emergency activities under this division, including mutual aid activities, shall be deemed conclusively to be for the direct protection and benefit of the inhabitants and property of the city. 
The director of emergency services, during a proclaimed emergency, shall have the authority to approve contracts and waive normal purchasing requirements as necessary to support the emergency response under this division and to protect the life and property of the residents of the city. The director shall have the authority to enter contracts or make purchases for any supplies, materials, equipment or services when any such item is immediately necessary for the continued operation of city government, for the preservation of life or property, or when such purchase is required for the health, safety and welfare of the people, provided there is a present, immediate and existing emergency. 
The finance director shall maintain a detailed accounting of all expenditures made under this provision and shall submit upon termination of the emergency, a detailed report to the city manager, who in turn shall provide the report to the city council.

The report shall contain a statement of the kind, nature, condition and quantity, and a brief description of such surplus property, shall state the location at which such property may be viewed, and shall give the names and addresses if possible of prospective purchaser if such information can be obtained by the department head.

Sec. 2-703. - Disposition of surplus personal property. 
Whenever the director of finance shall determine that sufficient surplus property, including scrap property and animals, has accumulated, he shall determine the method of disposition of said property, including using said property as a trade-in, accepting sealed bids for said property, sale by public auction, or any other method of disposition deemed acceptable by the director of finance. All such surplus property shall then be accumulated at a central location unless the director of finance grants an exception to this requirement and therein designates the property so excepted. Notice of such disposition shall be given by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, printed, published and circulated in the city, and by sending written notice to all persons who had requested notice and to all persons suggested by the department heads as prospective bidders, such notices to be published and mailed at least ten (10) days prior to date of sale. 
(Code 1952, § 2611; Ord. No. NS-1288, § 4, 1-5-76)

Sec. 2-704. - Sale of scrap, etc. 
Items of scrap, metal, paper, wood, etc., that have no value for the purpose for which they were originally designed but are useful only as salvage or scrap, may be sold by the director of finance at any time without public auction, upon the designation of said property as scrap by the head of the department possessing such material. 
(Code 1952, § 2611.1; Ord. No. NS-1288, § 6, 1-5-76)  
Sec. 2-705. - Disposal of unclaimed property.

Such property must be held by the police department for at least three (3) months. After property has been held for the period prescribed above and accumulations are deemed adequate in number of items for the conduct of an auction, the property may be transferred to the purchasing division for sale to the public at public auction. Notice of such auction sale will be given by the purchasing and property control officer at least (5) days before the time fixed therefor by publication once in the newspaper publishing city legal notices. 
After said notices are given, the sale shall be conducted by the purchasing and property control officer or, with the approval of the city manager, some other city employee or employed professional auctioneer. Property for which no bid is made at such sale may be given to a nonprofit charitable organization or destroyed as the purchasing and property control officer may direct. 
If the purchasing and property control officer determines that unclaimed property transferred to his jurisdiction for sale is needed for a public use, he may retain such property and dispense with the provisions of this section pertaining to sale. The purchasing and property control officer shall thereafter account for such property as though it had been acquired by the city through regular purchasing procedures, with the exception that accountability for the use and disposition of unclaimed property transferred back to the police department for official public purposes shall become the responsibility of the chief of police.

The successful bidder must deliver immediately following the declaration of sale, a written statement of his bid signed by the bidder, together with an initial deposit of ten (10) percent of the amount of his bid. The deposit may be in the form of a personal check provided such check is replaced before the close of business on the following business day by cash or by cashier's or certified check. Failure to deposit such written statement of bid or said ten (10) percent of the bid price in the manner stated may be considered a withdrawal of the bid. If a personal check is not replaced as required, a forfeit of one (1) percent of the sales price, as stated in the written statement of the bid, shall be required. The purchase of the property may then be offered to the second highest bidder of record.

In the event an agent covered by the contract, as set out in section 2-707, procures a bidder who submits the highest bid and to whom the sale is made and completed in due course, the commission provided in said contract shall be paid to said agent. In event an agent covered by the contract submits the highest written bid which conforms in all respects to the city's invitation to bid and the provisions of section 2-706, and an oral bid conforming to said requirements is made by a different bidder and results in the sale being made and completed to said different oral bidder, then one-half (½) of the commission originally fixed shall be paid to the listing agent who procured the original highest written conforming bid. If the successful oral bidder was procured and is represented by a licensed real estate agent or broker and the sale is made and completed, then the other one-half (½) of said commission shall be paid to such agent or broker. 
In cases where no listing contract exists and the successful bidder is represented by a licensed real estate broker, upon approval by the council, a full commission will be paid to such broker under the following conditions:

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 7-1. - Authorization. 
Pursuant to section 200 of its Charter, the city has the explicit authority to make and enforce all laws and regulations in respect to, including all provisions of this chapter. In addition, the Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-3. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide, mudflow or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
(a)  Protect human life and health; 
(b)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
(g)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(h)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-4. - Methods of reducing flood loss. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(d)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(e)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-5. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A zone. See "Special flood hazard area." 
Accessory structure means a structure that is either: 
(a)  Solely for the parking of no more than two (2) cars; or

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard. See "Special flood hazard area." 
Base flood means a flood which has a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one (1) percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgradei.e., below ground levelon all sides. 
Building. See "Structure." 
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before November 1, 1979. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
Flood, flooding, or flood water means: 
(a)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
(b)  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
Floodplain administrator is defined in section 7-13. 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
Floodplain variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93, or successor bulletins. 
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. Also referred to in this chapter as "Regulatory floodway." 
Floodway fringe is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted. 
Fraud and victimization as related to article IV of this chapter, means that the floodplain variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
Hardship means the floodplain exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested floodplain variance. The request for floodplain variance be unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(a)  Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the national register; 
(b)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(c)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
(d)  Individually listed on the city's list of historic places, adopted pursuant to chapter 30 of this Code. 
Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see definition of "Basement"). 
(a)  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  The flood openings standard in section 7-17; 
(2)  The anchoring standards in subsection 7-17(a); 
(3)  The construction materials and methods standards in subsection 7-17(b); and 
(4)  The standards for utilities in section 7-18. 
(b)  For residential structures regulated by this chapter, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see definition of "Basement"). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Market value means the substantial damage/improvement procedures referenced in subsection 7-14(b)(1). 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
New construction, for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 1, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 1, 1979. 
Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. See "Base flood." 
Program deficiency means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
Public safety and nuisance as related to article IV of this chapter, means that the granting of a floodplain variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis;

(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. 
Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including but not limited to tributaries, streams and brooks. 
Sheet flow area. See "Area of shallow flooding." 
Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means an area in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
Start of construction includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(a)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the city; and 
(c)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under this Code, state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-12. - Severability. 
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION 
 
Sec. 7-13. - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
Except as to article V of this chapter, the executive director of planning and building agency shall be designated as the floodplain administrator and administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. With respect to article V of this chapter, the executive director of the public works agency shall be designated as the floodplain administrator and administer, implement, and enforce said article. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-14. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(a)  Permit review. Review all development permits to determine: 
(1)  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
(2)  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
(3)  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
(4)  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the city; and 
(5)  All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
(b)  Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures. 
(1)  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings" as amended from time to time, develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
(2)  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
(c)  Review, use, and development of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 7-7, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer article III of this chapter. 
Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one (1) of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995, as amended from time to time. 
(d)  Notification of other agencies. 
(1)  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse. 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
(2)  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations. 
a.  Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
(3)  Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
(e)  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
(1)  Certification required by subsections 7-17(c)(1) and 7-20 (lowest floor elevations); 
(2)  Certification required by subsection 7-17(c)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
(3)  Certification required by subsection 7-14(c)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
(4)  Certification of elevation required by subsection 7-19(a)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
(5)  Certification required by subsection 7-22(b) (floodway encroachments); and 
(6)  Maintain a record of all floodplain variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such floodplain variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(f)  Map determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. Such determination may be appealed by any interested person as provided in section 7-25. 
(g)  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in section 7-8. 
(h)  Biennial report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
(i)  Planning. Assure the city's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-15. - Development permit. 
A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development, including manufactured homes, within any area of special flood hazard established in section 7-7. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city. The applicant shall provide the following minimum information: 
(a)  Plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing:

(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-22. - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(a)  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the city. 
(b)  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(c)  If subsection 7-22(a) and (b) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article III. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
ARTICLE IV. - FLOODPLAIN VARIANCE PROCEDURE 
 
Sec. 7-23. - Nature of floodplain variances. 
The issuance of a floodplain variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a floodplain variance. 
The floodplain variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that floodplain variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A floodplain variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
Floodplain variances shall be approved only in rare circumstances. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if floodplain variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the floodplain variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a floodplain variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a floodplain variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-24. - Conditions for floodplain variances. 
(a)  Generally, floodplain variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of articles II and III have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the floodplain variance increases. 
(b)  Floodplain variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in section 7-5) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Floodplain variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the floodplain variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of floodplain variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city finds will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
(e)  Any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a floodplain variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the county recorder's office of the County of Orange and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(f)  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all floodplain variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such floodplain variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)  
Sec. 7-25. - Appeals. 
(a)  In passing upon requests for floodplain variances, the city's planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
(1)  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
(11)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(b)  Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the floodplain variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a floodplain variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or chapters. 
(c)  Floodplain variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of section 7-25 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(d)  Upon consideration of such factors, the Planning Commission may approve, deny or approve with conditions any request for a floodplain variance. 
(e)  The planning commission shall hear such other appeals as are authorized by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. NS-2789, § 4, 7-20-09)

Sec. 8-44. - Transportation system improvement fee. 
(a)  In addition to any other charges, there shall be a special fee required as a condition precedent to the issuance of certain building permits for construction or improvement on those properties lying at least partially within any portion of the city designated by resolution of the city council as a transportation system improvement program area. 
(b)  The building official shall require the payment of a special fee in such amount as the city council shall set by resolution before a building permit will be issued when an application for a building permit indicates the following: 
(1)  A construction or improvement project which will result in an increase of floor area is on a parcel of land which lies wholly or partially within the boundaries of a transportation improvement program area; and 
(2)  The estimated cost of the proposed construction or improvement, as determined by the building official, will exceed thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). For purposes of this section the valuation per square foot shall not exceed that listed in the latest edition of "Building Standards Magazine" containing a building valuation data chart. 
A construction or improvement project shall not be deemed to result in an increase of floor area on a site to the extent that the floor area in the buildings to be constructed replaces floor area in any existing buildings on that site which are to be demolished, provided that such existing buildings are still in existence at the time of the approval, pursuant to Division 3 (commencing with section 41-668) of Article V of Chapter 41 of this Code, of a development project plan for the buildings to be constructed, and that reasonable evidence of the size of the floor area of the existing buildings is provided to the city by the owner or developer of the site. In such a case, the floor area of the buildings which are to be demolished shall be deducted from the floor area of the new buildings in determining the amount of the fee; provided, however, that in no event shall the owner or developer of the new buildings be entitled to receive any payment or credit from the city by reason of such deduction. If the demolition of the existing buildings is not to occur until after the construction of the new buildings, then either the fee for the new buildings shall be collected without set-off for the existing buildings and a refund in the amount of the set-off shall be made at the time of the demolition of those buildings, or the fee shall be paid in accordance with such agreement as the executive director of the public works agency may enter into with the owner or developer of the site on behalf of the city. 
(c)  The following construction and improvement projects are specifically excluded from the requirements of this section: 
(1)  Tenant improvements and maintenance work which will not increase the floor area of existing structures. 
(2)  Off-street parking facilities, whether surface or structured. 
(d)  Any resolution of the city council establishing a transportation system improvement program area shall have affixed thereto a map specifically describing the boundary of such transportation system improvement program area and shall be on file in the office of the clerk of the council. 
(e)  The purpose of a transportation system improvement program is to identify and designate those areas where the transportation system may experience a significant reduction in the level of service unless corrective measures are instituted concurrent with increased transportation demands. Fees collected for building projects and improvements on properties in a transportation systems improvement program area shall be used to improve the transportation system within such area when such improvements will substantially benefit the transportation system within the area.

Sec. 8-45. - Major thoroughfare and bridge fee. 
(a)  A building permit applicant, as a condition of issuance of a building permit, shall pay a fee as hereinafter established to defray the costs of constructing bridges over waterways, railways, freeways and canyons, or constructing major thoroughfares. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Construction. The term "construction" as used in this section includes preliminary studies, design, acquisition of right-of-way, administration of construction contracts, and actual construction. 
(2)  Major thoroughfare. The term "major thoroughfare" means those roads designated as transportation corridors and major, primary, secondary, or commuter highways on the master plan of arterial highways, the circulation element of the general plan. The primary purpose of such roads is to carry through traffic and provide a network connecting to the state highway system. 
(3)  Bridge facilities mean those locations identified in the transportation of flood control provisions of the circulation element or other element of the general plan as requiring a bridge to span a waterway, a railway, freeway, or canyon. 
(4)  Area of benefit means a specified area wherein it has been determined that the real property located therein will benefit from the construction of a major thoroughfare or bridge project. 
(c)  The provisions herein for payment of a fee shall apply only if the major thoroughfare or bridge facility has been included in an element of the city's general plan or the general plan of the County of Orange adopted at least thirty (30) days prior to the application for a building permit and on land located within the boundaries of the area of benefit. 
(d)  Payment of fees shall not be required unless any major thoroughfares are in addition to, or a widening or reconstruction of, any existing major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit. 
(e)  Payment of fees shall not be required unless any planned bridge facility is a new bridge serving the area or an addition to an existing bridge facility serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit. 
(f)  Action to establish an area of benefit may be initiated by the city council upon its motion or upon the recommendation of the executive director of public service agency. The city council shall set a public hearing for each proposed area benefitted. Notice of the time and place of said hearing including preliminary information related to the boundaries of benefit, estimated costs and the method of fee apportionment shall be given in accordance with Government Code Section 65091. 
(g)  At the public hearing the city council will consider the testimony, written protests, and other evidence. At the conclusion of the public hearing the city council may, unless a majority written protest is filed and not withdrawn, determine to establish an area of benefit, setting forth the boundaries of the area of benefit, setting forth the cost, whether actual or estimated, and the method of fee apportionment. A certified copy of such resolution shall be recorded by the city clerk with the Orange County Recorder's Office. 
(1)  Such apportioned fees shall be applicable to all property within the area of benefit and shall be payable as a condition of issuing a building permit for such property or portions thereof. Where the area of benefit includes lands not subject to the payment of fees pursuant to this section, the city council shall make provisions for payment of the share of improvement cost apportioned to such lands from other sources. 
(2)  Written protests shall be received by the city clerk at any time prior to the close of the public hearing. If written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefitted by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented by the protests to less than one-half of the area to be benefitted, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the city council shall not, for one (1) year from the filing of said written protests, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement under the provisions of this section. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the close of the public meeting. 
(3)  If any majority protests are directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all future proceedings under the provisions of this section to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one (1) year, but the city council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement so protested against. Such proceedings shall be commenced by a new notice and public hearing as set forth in subsection (f) above. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city council, within such one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of an improvement or portion of the improvements so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefitted are in favor of going forward with such improvement or portion thereof. 
(h)  Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund. A fund shall be established for each planned bridge facility project or each planned major thoroughfare project. If the area of benefit is one in which more than one (1) bridge or major thoroughfare is required to be constructed, a separate fund may be established covering all of the bridge projects or major thoroughfares in the area of benefit. If the area of benefit encompasses one (1) or more bridges and one (1) or more thoroughfares and all lands within the area of benefit are subject to the same proportionate fee for all bridges and thoroughfares, a single fund may be established to account for fees paid. Monies in such fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the improvements serving the area to be benefitted and from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, to reimburse the city for the costs of constructing the improvement. 
(i)  The city council may approve the acceptance of consideration in lieu of the payment of fees established herein. 
(j)  The city council may approve the advancement of money from the general fund or road fund to pay the costs of constructing the improvements covered herein and may reimburse the general fund or road fund for such advances from planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare funds established pursuant to this section. 
(k)  If the building permit applicant, as a condition of the issuance of the building permit, is required or desires to construct a bridge or major thoroughfare, the city council may enter into a reimbursement agreement with the applicant. Such agreement may provide for payments to the applicant from the bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund covering that specific project to reimburse the applicant for costs not allocated to the applicant's property in the resolution establishing the area of benefit. If the bridge or major thoroughfare fund covers more than one (1) project, reimbursements shall be made on a pro rata basis reflecting the actual or estimated costs of the projects covered by the fund. 
(Ord. No. NS-1829, § 1, 1-20-86)  
Sec. 8-46. - Fire facilities fee. 
(a)  In addition to any other fees and charges, a fire facilities fee is required as a condition precedent to the issuance of building permit for construction of buildings exceeding two (2) stories in height (excluding parking structures and excluding buildings owned and occupied by agencies of the federal, state or local governments). The fee shall be in such amount as shall be set by resolution of the city council. In the event that, for any reason, the fee is not collected prior to issuance of the building permit, it shall be collected prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(b)  The purpose of the fire facilities fee is to provide revenue to pay for equipment needed to fight fires in the expanding number of buildings over two (2) stories in height in the city, and to improve fire stations in the city as necessary to accommodate such equipment and otherwise augment the city's capability to fight fires in such buildings. The fire facilities fee revenues shall be used for such purpose. The facilities to be financed with fire facility fee revenues shall be identified in the resolution of the city council setting the amount of the fee. 
(c)  In establishing the fire facilities fee, the city council finds and determines that buildings over two (2) stories in height require unique firefighting equipment and fire station configurations, that the city has experienced considerable development of such buildings in the recent past and will continue to do so in the future, and that the acquisition of new equipment to fight fires in such buildings and the improvement of fire stations to accommodate such equipment are needs arising directly from the expanding development of such buildings. 
(d)  All fire facility fee revenues shall be deposited in an account separate and apart from other city revenues and may be expended from such solely to pay for the cost of the facilities identified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or to reimburse the city for moneys expended by the city on such facilities from other revenue sources. Moneys in the fire facilities fee account may be temporarily invested in the same manner as other city moneys, and any interest income earned by moneys in the fire facilities account shall also be deposited in that account and shall be subject to the same limitations as fee revenues.

Sec. 8-47. - Proactive rental enforcement program fee. 
All funds received pursuant to the provisions of section of Article X, Division 2 of chapter 8 of this Code shall be deposited in a separate account and identified with a separate unique expenditure activity number. All such funds shall be expended solely for the proactive rental enforcement program and shall not be used for any other purpose. 
All interest income earned by the moneys in the proactive rental enforcement program account shall also be expended only for the proactive rental enforcement program. Should such monies be invested in combination with other funds and accounts, then the pro rata share of the interest earned by all such monies that is attributable to the program account shall be expended for the proactive rental enforcement program.

Secs. 8-48, 8-49. - Reserved.  
Sec. 8-50. - Lot line waivers. 
(a)  In the event that land has been divided without prior approval of the city in the manner set forth in the Subdivision Map Act and subdivision regulations of the city, and such division results in violations of the building code by reason of the interior lot lines thereby created, the requirements of the building code which apply to existing buildings, other than R occupancy buildings, by reason of such interior lot lines may be waived, if: 
(1)  The owners of the lots created by the division submit a tentative map for the division and obtain conditional approval thereof; and 
(2)  The existing buildings are not rendered substantially less safe by reason of the lot lines thereby created than would be the case if the land had remained under single ownership and the building space had been divided by long-term leases or condominiums into units similar to those resulting from the division of land; and 
(3)  The restructuring or remodeling of the buildings to strictly conform to the building code requirements arising by reason of the interior lot lines would cause economic hardship disproportionate to the additional protection against spread of fire between ownership units which would result from strict adherence to such building code requirements. 
(b)  As used herein, "existing building" means a building in existence prior to the time of submission of a tentative map pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act and the subdivision regulations of the city. 
(c)  A waiver under this section shall be approved, conditionally approved, or denied by the city council after review and recommendations by the building official, the fire chief, and the executive director of public services. Any such waiver may be made subject to conditions designated to maintain or improve building safety, including: 
(1)  A requirement for covenants, conditions and restrictions running with the lots created by the division of land; 
(2)  A requirement that fire flow limitations as specified by the fire chief shall not be exceeded; 
(3)  Additional water service for fire protection purposes,

If entry were refused, the building official or an authorized representative shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
When the building official or an authorized representative shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, an owner or occupant or other persons having charge, care or control of the building or premises shall not fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building official or authorized representative for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this Code. 
(d)  Stop orders. Whenever work is being done contrary to the provisions of this Code, the building official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to be done, and such persons shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the building official to proceed with the work. 
(e)  Authority to disconnect utilities in emergencies. The building official or authorized representative shall have the authority to disconnect electric power or energy service supplied to the building, structure or building service equipment therein regulated by this code in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building official shall whenever possible notify the serving utility, the owner and occupant of the building, structure or electrical system or equipment of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action, and shall notify the serving utility, owner and occupant of the building, structure or building service equipment, in writing, of the disconnection immediately thereafter. 
(f)  Authority to condemn electrical system and equipment. Whenever the building official ascertains that an electrical system or equipment regulated in this code has become hazardous to life, health or property, the building official shall order in writing that such electrical system or equipment either be removed or restored to safe condition, whichever is appropriate. The written notice itself shall fix a time limit for compliance with such order. Persons shall not use or maintain defective electrical system or equipment after receiving notice.

When an electrical system or equipment is maintained in violation of this Code and in violation of a notice issued pursuant to the provisions of this section, the building official shall institute appropriate action to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate the violation. 
(g)  Connection after order to disconnect. persons shall not make connections from an energy or power supply nor supply power to an electrical system or equipment which has been disconnected or ordered to be disconnected by the building official or the use of which has been ordered to be discontinued by the building official until the building official authorizes the reconnection and use of the electrical system or equipment. 
This Code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of a person owning, operating or controlling any building, structure or building service equipment therein for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the code enforcement agency or its parent jurisdiction be held as assuming such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this Code or approvals issued under this code. 
(h)  Reserved. 
(i)  Cooperation of other officials and officers. The building official may request, and shall receive so far as is required in the discharge of duties, the assistance and cooperation of other officials of this jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 47, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-685. - Unsafe electrical systems or equipment. 
Electrical systems or equipment regulated by this code which are unsafe, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life are, for the purpose of this section, unsafe. Use of electrical systems or equipment regulated by this code constituting a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster, damage or abandonment is, for the purpose of this section, an unsafe use. 
Unsafe electrical systems or equipment are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings or an alternate procedure as may be adopted by this jurisdiction. As an alternative, the building official or other employee or official of this jurisdiction as designated by the governing body may institute other appropriate action to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate the violation. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 48, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-686. - Permits required. 
(a)  Except as specified in subsection (b), it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to install, alter, repair, move, convert or maintain any electrical equipment regulated by this code, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a separate permit for each building or structure, each office suite, and each unit in a commercial or industrial building, from the building official. 
(b)  Exempt work. An electrical permit shall not be required for the following: 
(1)  Portable motors or other portable appliances energized by means of a cord or cable having an attachment plug and to be connected to an approved receptacle when the cord or cable is permitted by this Code. 
(2)  Residential temporary decorative lighting. 
(3)  Repair or replacement of current-carrying parts of any switch, contactor or control device. 
(4)  Reinstallation of attachment plug receptacles, but not the outlets thereof. 
(5)  Repair or replacement of any over current device of the required capacity in the same location. 
(6)  Repair or replacement of electrodes or transformers of the same size and capacity for signs or gas tube systems. 
(7)  Taping joints. 
(8)  Temporary wiring for experimental purposes in suitable experimental laboratories.

(10)  A permit shall not be required for the installation, alteration or repair of electrical wiring, apparatus or equipment or the generation, transmission, distribution or metering of electrical energy or in the operation of signals or the transmission of intelligence by a public or private utility in the exercise of its function as a serving utility. 
(c)  Exemption from the permit requirements of this code shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in violation of the provisions of this code or any other laws or ordinances of this jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 49, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-687. - Application for permit. 
(a)  To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an application thereof in writing on a form furnished by the code enforcement agency for that purpose. Every such application shall: 
(1)  Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which application is made. 
(2)  Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by legal description, street address, or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or work. 
(3)  Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended. 
(4)  Be accompanied by plans, diagrams, computations and specifications and other data as required in subsection (b). 
(5)  Be signed by permittee, or authorized agent. 
(6)  Give such other data and information as may be required by the building official. 
(b)  Plans, specifications, engineering calculations, diagrams and other data shall be submitted in one (1) or more sets with each application for a permit. The building official may require plans, computations, and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the state to practice as such. The building official may waive the submission of plans, calculations, etc., if the building official finds that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with this Code. 
(c)  Plans and specifications shall be drawn to scale upon substantial paper or cloth and shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this Code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
Plans for buildings more than two (2) stories in height of other than groups R, division 3 and M occupancies shall indicate how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will be maintained where a penetration will be made for electrical and communication conduits, pipes and similar systems. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 50, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-688. - Permit issuance. 
(a)  Issuance. The application, plans and specifications, and other data, filed by an applicant for permit shall be reviewed by the building official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction. If the building official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this Code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees specified in the city fee resolution have been paid, the building official shall, therefore, issue a permit to the applicant. 
When the building official issues a permit, the plans and specifications shall be endorsed in writing or stamped "APPROVED." Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorizations from the building official, and all work regulated by this Code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole system have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this Code. The holders of such permits shall proceed at their own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building, structure, or building service will be granted. 
(b)  Retention of plans. One (1) set of approved plans, specifications, and computations shall be retained by the building official until final approval of the work covered therein. One (1) set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 51, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-689. - Permit fees. 
The fee for each electrical permit shall be as set forth in the miscellaneous fee resolution of the city. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 52, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-690. - Inspections. 
(a)  General. All electrical systems and equipment for which a permit is required by this Code shall be subject to inspection by the building official, and the electrical system shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the building official. 
It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the electrical system to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the building official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for the expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to permit inspection. When the installation of an electrical system and equipment is complete, an additional and final inspection shall be made. Electrical systems and equipment regulated by this Code shall not be connected to the energy source until authorized by the building official. 
Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel provisions of this Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. 
(b)  Inspection requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the building official that such work is ready for inspection. The building official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one (1) working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone at the option of the building official. 
It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by this Code to provide access to and means for inspection of such work. 
(c)  Operation of electrical equipment. The requirements of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the operation of any electrical system or equipment installed to replace existing equipment. The request for inspection of such equipment must have been filed with the building official not more than forty-eight (48) hours after such replacement work is completed and before any portion of such electrical system is concealed by any permanent portion of the building. 
(d)  Other inspections. In addition to the called inspections required by this Code, the building official may make or require other inspections of any work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Code and other laws that are enforced by the code enforcement agency. 
(e)  Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection. 
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building official. 
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application thereof in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with Table No. 3-A. 
In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid. 
(Ord. No. NS-2522, § 53, 2-3-03)  
Sec. 8-691. - Connection approval. 
(a)  Energy connections. An electrical system or equipment regulated by this Code for which a permit is required shall not be connected to a source of energy or power until approved by the building official. 
(b)  Temporary connections. The building official may authorize the temporary connection of the electrical system or equipment to the source of energy or power for the purpose of testing the equipment, or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy.

( Ord. No. NS-2898, § 5, 5-17-16 )  
Sec. 8-1961. - Purpose and intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the Proactive Rental Enforcement Program (PREP) is to promote public health, safety, and welfare through a system of proactive code enforcement involving residential rental property within the City of Santa Ana. This code enforcement effort is designed to ensure continued compliance with Section 17920.3 of the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 8 and 41 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code (SAMC or Code), the Housing Code, the California Building, Electrical, Plumbing and Mechanical Codes which, as adopted by the City of Santa Ana, govern substandard building conditions. The implementation of this program also promotes environments in which unhealthy conditions and life safety hazards are reduced for occupants of residential rental property by identifying and correcting code violations which result in: a threat to occupants' safety, a threat to a building's structural integrity including plumbing, heating and electrical systems, and a negative impact on the surrounding neighborhood. 
B.  Intent. The intent of this Division is to proactively identify substandard conditions on residential housing property and in residential housing units located thereon; to ensure the preservation, rehabilitation or abatement of rental housing that does not comply with State and local building and housing laws and with maintenance standards established by this Division or is unsafe to occupy; to ensure the health and safety of residents of the City of Santa Ana living in rental housing units. It is the intent of this program to address conditions that are immediate hazards or clearly present a threat to human life, health or safety. Such conditions will receive full and rapid enforcement. Significant code violations that are not immediate hazards to human life, health or safety will be subject to full enforcement proceedings however, reasonable time periods shall be established for compliance.

Monetary Incentive - Owners of rental property who apply and qualify for the program are exempt from the regulation inspection fee. 
Marketing Incentive - Owners of rental property who apply and qualify for the program are presented with materials to utilize when marketing their units.

A.  Unpaid regulatory inspection fee 
B.  Outstanding code violations

3.  QUALIFYING FOR THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
In order to qualify for the incentive program, a rental property owner must pass all parts of a three-stage process. 
Level One - The rental property owner will notify the City that he/she wishes to apply for the incentive program and fill out the appropriate application. This will initiate a review and evaluation of the property's management practices. Owners will be asked to provide the necessary information and documentation to verify that they currently adhere to the following five good management practices: 
Good Management Practices: 
a)  Owner abides by all fair housing laws 
b)  Owner uses a formal method to screen all potential residents 
c)  Owner utilizes a written rental agreement that contains specific criteria 
d)  Owner utilizes written "House Rules" 
e)  Owner performs "walk-throughs" at the beginning and end of each tenancy 
Specific criteria necessary for verification of the "good management practices" shall be outlined in the program implementation policy. 
Each management practice must be passed in order to advance to Level Two and is subject to on-site verification during the Level Two Inspection. 
Level Two - Only owners who have passed Level One of this program will be eligible to initiate Level Two. This stage consists of an exterior inspection of the property and verification of the current use of the good management practice materials submitted by the owner during Level One. The criteria for this exterior inspection is listed under "Violation Checklist" and the inspector evaluating the exterior conditions will do so with the goal that such conditions should be in an "above average" to "superior" condition and collectively the property should be in exceptional condition. The criteria and/or specific materials necessary for the on-site verification of the good management practices shall be outlined in the program implementation policy and the property owner shall be made aware of the materials necessary prior to the Level Two Inspection. 
A property must have a 100% pass rating of the criteria listed under "Violation Checklist, Exterior/Common Area, Must Pass Items" and have an overall 85% pass rating of rest of the criteria in order to clear approval of Level Two and advance to Level Three of the incentive program. 
Level Three - Only owners who have passed Level Two of this program will be eligible to initiate Level Three. This stage consists of an interior inspection of rental units. The criteria for this inspection is listed under "Violation Checklist, Interior Areas" and the inspector evaluating the Interior conditions will do so with the goal that such conditions should be in an "above average" to "superior" condition and collectively the property should be in exceptional condition. 
A maximum of 10% of the dwelling units in a complex (rounded up on any fraction) will be inspected (but no less than one unit). The units to be inspected will be selected by the inspector from a list of at least 20% of the units on the property (vacant and/or occupied) selected by the owner. 
A property must achieve a score of 85% or higher to achieve passage of this stage of the incentive program. 
Prioritization of Applications - Applications will be reviewed in the order they are received. Incentive benefits will be awarded on a first come basis by qualification date. Twenty percent of the properties qualifying for the benefits must contain 15 units or less and 20% must contain 16 units or more, The remaining sixty percent may be from either category. 
Applicants whose properties qualify for the Gold Seal benefit but who cannot receive exemption due to a lack of available funding will be placed on a priority list by certification date. Should funding become available, these priority applicants will only be required to pass a Level One Inspection to qualify for the available funds. The certification period will begin on the date they pass all the required program incentive criteria. 
4.  AWARDING THE "GOLD SEAL" 
Only owners who have achieved passage of all three levels will qualify for the monetary and marketing incentives granted to exceptional properties under the Gold Seal incentive program. 
Once granted, the Gold Seal will be valid for four (4) years and will run with the property, not with the ownership, during that time. However, it is the responsibility of the new owner to notify the City of the transfer of ownership and to continue to meet the obligations of the program. After 4 years, in order for a property to continue to receive the benefits of the Gold Seal Incentive Program, the owner must reapply for the program and completely requalify through the process outlined in this document. 
5.  DELAYED EXEMPTIONS 
Applicants who fall to meet the established qualification deadline to be certified for the Gold Seal benefit may be qualified for the award when the applicant can provide proof that a processing delay on the part of the City was the cause for them missing the deadline. 
6.  QUALIFICATION EXEMPTION 
On occasion a property may be documented to have exemplary management practices, but such efforts are negated by special circumstances beyond the owner's/manager's control (such as property location, gang activity or external vandalism) which prevent the property from qualifying. In some rare cases and only at the discretion of the Code Enforcement Manager, certain properties may be qualified for the benefits of the incentive program because of special circumstances. 
7.  LOSS OF INCENTIVE PROGRAM PRIVILEGES 
If a qualified property has deteriorated to the point that it is no longer exceptional, the Code Enforcement Manager may choose to re-evaluate the property and, if necessary, revoke the property's incentive program privileges, Program privileges would cease on the date the revocation occurs. Such properties would not be eligible for the incentive program benefits for a period of twelve (12) months beginning with the date of revocation. Property owners whose property privileges have been revoked may not reapply during the twelve (12) months they are on suspension. The privileges of requalifying properties will not be effective until the beginning of the next fiscal year following the twelve (12) month suspension, 
8.  APPEALS 
Those owners who have applied for the incentive program but do not qualify or have failed may appeal such decisions to the Executive Director or his/her designee. The decision of the Executive Director, or his/her designee, shall be final.

"Residential building" means any improved real property, or portion thereof, designed or permitted to be used for dwelling purposes, including buildings and structures located on such improved real property.

At the time when the building official serves the aforesaid order, the building official shall file with the office of the county recorder of the County of Orange a certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of Santa Ana Municipal Code, Article XI of Chapter 8, "Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings." The certificate shall also state that the owner thereof has been notified and ordered to structurally analyze the building and to structurally strengthen or demolish it where compliance with Article XI is not exhibited. 
If the building is either demolished, found not to be within the scope of this article, or is found to be structurally capable of resisting minimum seismic forces required by this article, the building official shall file with the office of the county recorder a certificate terminating the status of the subject building as being classified within the scope of Santa Ana Municipal Code, Article XI of Chapter 8, "Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings." 
(c)  Appeal from order. Any owner or tenant of the building may appeal the building official's initial order and determination so long as such appeal is filed within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the service of the aforesaid order. The filing and form of appeal, the processing of the appeal, the scheduling and noticing of said appeal for hearing, the effect of a failure to appeal, the scope of hearing of said appeal, and the procedure for conducting the hearing of any such appeal, shall be governed by the provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, as said Uniform Code is adopted by reference pursuant to the provisions of Article IX of Chapter 8 of this Code. In case of any inconsistency between the provisions of this subsection and the provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, the provisions of this subsection shall control. 
(d)  Enforcement. If the owner or tenant fails to comply with any order issued by the building official within any of the time limits set forth in subsection (a) of this section, or with any order or decision rendered by the planning commission, the building shall be deemed to constitute a dangerous building and the provisions of Chapters 7, 8, and 9 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, as said uniform code is adopted by reference in Article IX of Chapter 8 of this Code, shall be applicable. Any person found guilty of a misdemeanor shall be punished in the manner set forth in section 1-8 of this Code.

Sec. 9-117. - Reduction-in-force. 
When it becomes necessary because of lack of work, lack of funds, or other sufficient reason, to reduce the staff of any city office, activity or department, the reduction shall be accomplished by laying off the employee or employees with the least amount of service, including temporary appointees, that have been appointed in the class, until the necessary reduction has been made. Vacancies in the lowest class, resulting from such lay-off, shall be filled by the employee or employees last appointed to the next higher class, and those vacant positions filled by the employee or employees in the next succeeding higher class and so on until all vacant positions have been filled. Re-employment shall be in reverse order of any lay-off or demotion made under the terms of this section and prior to any other appointments. 
(Code 1952, § 2244; Ord. No. NS-277, § 2, 9-3-57; Ord. No. NS-2232, § 1, 9-19-94; Ord. No. NS-2285, § 8, 5-6-96)

(a)  Right to exercise the disciplinary and dismissal powers hereinafter provided is vested respectively in the officers of the city who have the power of appointment as to any position in the personnel system. 
(b)  Except as specified in subparagraph (d), any employee serving a probationary period in a position in the civil service shall be subject to suspension without pay for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, demotion or dismissal, and the employee so disciplined or discharged shall not have a right of appeal, except that an employee who held regular status in some other position or employment included within the civil service immediately prior to his appointment to probationary status shall not be discharged without written notice of charges, an opportunity to answer, a written decision as hereinafter provided and right of appeal to the personnel board. 
(c)  Except as specified in subparagraph (d), any employee, other than one serving a probationary period, holding a position in the civil service shall be subject to suspension without pay for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, or to demotion, or to dismissal subject to a right to appeal to the personnel board in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article. However, such appeal shall not stay the imposition of suspension, demotion or dismissal following the written decision of the appointing authority. 
(d)  Each or any of said actions relating to suspension, demotion, or dismissal may be taken by the officer having power of appointment to the position for reasonable and sufficient cause; provided, however, that no employee who is exempt from the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be subject to suspension without pay for any period of less than one (1) week. 
(e)  Each such employee shall have ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the written decision of the appointing authority in which to file a notice requesting a hearing before the personnel board. Such request for a hearing shall be filed with the executive director of human resources. If a hearing is requested, the personnel board shall thereupon set a date for hearing the matter at its earliest convenience. Hearing procedures shall be informal, and the rules of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply. 
Such employee shall have an opportunity at such hearing to be heard in person, or by counsel, and the right to subpoena witnesses. Except as otherwise provided by law, all hearings held under the provisions of this section shall be open to the public.

(g)  If, with respect to a suspension, demotion, or dismissal, the personnel board shall conclude that the employee charged was not guilty of the act or omission resulting in such suspension, demotion, or dismissal, a recommendation by it of reinstatement without loss of pay shall be binding upon the appointing authority, who forthwith shall order such reinstatement. In the event that the personnel board shall conclude that the employee was guilty of the act or omission resulting in such suspension, demotion, or dismissal but that the penalty was not warranted under the circumstances, the personnel board may review the severity and appropriateness of the punishment. A recommendation by it of a greater or lesser punishment or of reinstatement with or without loss of pay shall be binding upon the appointing authority, who forthwith shall order the same. 
If, with respect to a suspension, demotion or dismissal, the personnel board concludes that the employee was guilty of the act or omission resulting in such suspension, demotion or dismissal, and that such punishment was warranted, such decision shall be final. 
(h)  Vacancies created under this section may be filled by the appointing authority by temporary appointment pending the completion of any proceedings taken hereunder. 
(i)  A reduction in pay shall be treated as a demotion under this section, unless the reduction in pay is part of a plan of reclassification of positions or of a plan to reduce salaries and wages in connection with a general economy or curtailment program, or is the result of a finding by the appointing authority that the employee's performance does not justify the continuance of a level of pay that is dependent upon meritorious service. A failure to grant an increase in pay at a time when an increase would otherwise have been granted as a part of a plan to increase salaries and wages throughout the city service shall not be treated as a demotion under this section. 
(j)  The personnel board may adopt procedural rules to govern the conduct of its hearings.

Amendment note Ord. No. NS-994, § 1, amended § 2252 of the 1952 Code, § 9-130 herein, by adding the provisions pertaining to absence on sick leave. Ord. No. NS-1094, § 2, amended § 9-130 by including probationary employees in the application of the provisions and revising the provisions relative to the vacation period for fire department members.  
Sec. 9-131. - Computing regular vacation. 
In computing regular vacation, each municipal holiday that occurs during the vacation, and that falls on a day which the employee would have worked had he or she not been on vacation, shall be deducted from the computation so that one (1) additional day of regular vacation shall be allowed to the employee unless departmental practice provides some other manner of compensating for municipal holidays. Should an employee be confined to a hospital for sickness or injury while on authorized vacation, each full day of such confinement, when confirmed by a physician's statement and upon department head approval, may be deducted from the computation of vacation expended and charged against the employee's accumulated sick leave. 
No employee may accumulate more than the equivalent of one (1) regular vacation period from the previous year, and vacation not taken beyond that amount is forfeited. A regular vacation period is defined as the maximum of vacation earned in a calendar year as provided in section 9-130 of this Code. No employee shall have a right to accumulate or split his or her vacation, but the same may be allowed or required by the department head. The time at which an employee shall take his or her vacation shall be determined by his or her department head, with due regard for the wishes of the employee and particular regard for the needs of the service. It is the policy of the city to grant employees vacations in order to provide them a break in their regular work schedule. In the administration of the provisions of this section the department head shall be guided by this stated purpose and he or she must approve in writing any accumulation of regular vacation. 
(Pers. Rules, § 2253, Ord. No. NS-577, § 1, 4-16-62 ; NS-1094, § 2, 11-15-71; Ord. No. NS-2232, § 1, 9-19-94)

No employee becomes eligible for longevity vacation until completion of the sixth year of continuous service, and each employee continues to earn the maximum of ten (10) working days of longevity vacation for each completed year of service in excess of twenty (20) years. For uniformed members of the fire department assigned to the twenty-four (24) hour shift schedule, the working day granted is a twelve (12) hour day. 
A period of earlier service does not apply toward longevity vacation accumulation when an employee has had a break in continuous service, unless the break in service is concluded by reappointment, as provided in section 9-114, or by reemployment within two (2) years at a higher level classification in the former occupational field. Leave of absence without pay, as provided in sections 9-141 or 9-164, does not constitute a break in continuous service as used in this section; however, the leave of absence period shall not be applied toward the accumulation of longevity vacation. Absence on military leave followed by reinstatement does not constitute a break in service, and the period of absence on such military leave shall be applied toward the accumulation of longevity vacation.

Further, no employee may accumulate more than the equivalent of one (1) longevity vacation period, and the equivalent of one (1) regular vacation period, from a previous year, and vacation not taken beyond that amount is forfeited.

(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, industrial injury compensation will be paid at a rate equivalent to one hundred (100) percent of the employee's normal gross salary for all full work days lost, for a period or periods equal in total to not more than six (6) months and occurring during a twelve-month period commencing with the initial date of absence due to the injury or disease. The twelve-month period may be extended to eighteen (18) months by the employee's appointing authority if the appointing authority determines that the city can accommodate the employee's return to work in a limited hour capacity of twenty (20) hours or more per week, if the employee obtains a release for such limited work from a physician designated by the city, and if the employee does return to work on such basis. In such event, absences for less than a full work day shall be eligible for industrial injury compensation pursuant to this subsection. 
(c)  Sick leave shall be applied to the absence of the employee as follows: 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section, deduction shall be made from the employee's accumulated sick leave for the first three (3) days that the employee is absent due to an injury or disease compensable under the Act unless the period of such absence equals or exceeds fourteen (14) days. In the event the period of such absence does equal or exceed fourteen (14) days, sick leave shall be reaccredited to accrued sick leave, and all days absence due to such injury or disease which had been accounted as sick leave shall be converted to industrial injury leave. 
(2)  If the employee has no accumulated leave, it shall be advanced and deduction shall be made from any subsequently earned until the total amount advanced has been recovered. If the employee should leave the employment of the city prior to recovery of the sick leave advanced, adjustment shall be made of any final paycheck, if practicable. 
(3)  In the event that the injury or disease results in immediate hospitalization, no sick leave will be applicable and industrial injury leave will commence immediately. 
(d)  Any period of time during which an employee is required to be absent from his or her position by reason of an injury or disease for which the employee is entitled to receive compensation shall not be considered a break in his or her continuous service for the purpose of his or her right to salary adjustments, sick leave, vacation, or seniority.

Such employee shall be entitled to payment for one-third ( 1/3 ) of the total sick leave benefit credited to his or her account upon his or her effective date of retirement and at the rate of pay, effective on that date.

(1)  The city, under the police power delegated to it by the Constitution of the State of California, has the authority to enact legislation when the potential exists for jeopardy to the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. 
(2)  The city council is concerned with the level of juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity, and juvenile crime in the city. 
(3)  The crimes committed by juveniles include serious offenses such as murders, drive-by shootings, drug related crimes and other gang related activity. 
(4)  The ability to make reasoned judgments, resist peer pressure and understand the consequences of improper conduct increases with age, knowledge and experience, all of which are likely to increase as a person grows older, therefore the justification of the application of the curfew to minors, but not adults. 
(5)  Juveniles are particularly susceptible, by their lack of maturity and experience, to participation in unlawful and gang related activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. 
(6)  Recent local statistics regarding juvenile crime and victimization indicate that enforcement of a curfew for juveniles decreases the percentage of juvenile victimization and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes during curfew hours.

(c)  Person responsible for the event is the person who owns the property where the party, gathering or event takes place; the person in charge of the premises and/or the person who organized the event.

(d)  Special security assignment means the assignment of police officers and services during a second call to a location after the distribution of a written warning that the party, gathering or event violates the law.

The purpose of this Article is to protect the safety and welfare of the public and improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Santa Ana by imposing reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on aggressive and intrusive solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens. 
Aggressive or intrusive solicitation typically includes approaching or following pedestrians, the use of abusive language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Aggressive or intrusive solicitation can contribute to the loss of access to, and enjoyment of, places open to the public, and can create an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation, and disorder. 
Solicitation from people in places where they are a "captive audience" because it is difficult or impossible for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or avoid solicitation from others, presents a risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines can be intimidating or threatening. Such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property. Other "captive audience" locations include public transportation vehicles, their designated locations for stops, outdoor dining areas, and gasoline stations. Restricting solicitation in such places will provide a balance between the rights of solicitors and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such solicitations and will help to diminish or avoid the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations. 
Solicitation in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians, and the general public due to the increased risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic, which may result in automobile accidents, congestion, blockage of streets, and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems. 
The practice of solicitation near driveways accessing shopping centers, retail establishments, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians, and the general public. The location of a solicitor near a driveway compromises a solicitor's safety, impedes visibility, and impairs a driver's ability to safely enter and exit. Drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic, which may result in automobile accidents, congestion, blockage of streets, and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.

(Ord. No. NS-2041, § 2, 1-2-90)  
Sec. 14-108. - License suspension or revocation. 
(a)  The licensing officer may suspend or revoke a license for failure by the licensee to comply and maintain compliance with, or for violation of, any applicable provisions, standards or requirements of state law or regulation or this article, or of any regulations promulgated hereunder. Suspension of a license is not a condition precedent to revocation of a license. 
(b)  Before suspension or revocation, the licensing officer shall give written notice to the licensee. Said notice shall: 
(1)  Specify the reasons for which the action is to be taken; 
(2)  Set a hearing for not more than fifteen (15) days nor less than seven (7) days after the date of the notice; 
(3)  Specify the date, time and place of the hearing; and

(e)  The licensing officer may reduce the period of time for hearing under a suspension or revocation notice to no less than twenty-four (24) hours when the licensing officer makes written preliminary findings that such action is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. When, as a result of such an emergency proceeding, a license is suspended or revoked, the licensee may request an additional hearing at which the licensee will have the burden of establishing renewed compliance justifying reinstatement of the license. Such additional hearing will be commenced within five (5) days of the licensee's request. The request for, and the scheduling of, an additional hearing shall not stay operation of the suspension or revocation order. 
(f)  During all times when a county-city agreement is in effect, the hearings referenced in this section shall be conducted and decisions shall be made on such hearings in accordance with the procedures established by the county for hearings on the revocation or suspension of the licenses of ambulance services operating in the unincorporated areas of the county. 
(g)  During any time when a county-city agreement is not in effect, hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted before the fire chief of the city or his designated representative, who shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing. 
(Ord. No. NS-2041, § 2, 1-2-90)  
Sec. 14-109. - Appeals. 
(a)  In the event of a denial, suspension or revocation of a license during any time when a county-city agreement is in effect, the applicant or licensee shall have the same right to appeal such denial, suspension or revocation as is provided by the county to an applicant for, or licensee under, a license to operate an ambulance service in the unincorporated area of the county. 
(b)  During any time during which a city-county agreement is not in effect, a denial, suspension or revocation of a license may be appealed to the city council of the city pursuant to Chapter 3 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code.

Applications for such licenses shall be in a form required by the licensing officer and shall be accompanied by the fee, if any, established therefor. All applicants for licenses as attendants shall be subject to the same criminal history review as required for principals of ambulance companies pursuant to this article no less than once every four (4) years. Certificates may be denied, suspended or revoked in the same form and fashion as specified for ambulance service licensees in this article. Licenses shall be valid for two (2) years from the date of issuance or certification as an Emergency Medical Technician 1A, whichever is less. Renewal of a license shall be in the same fashion as issuance of a new license. 
(c)  Each licensee shall have at least one dispatcher. Emergency ambulance service licensees shall have a dispatcher on a twenty-four-hour-per-day basis and shall adequately train the dispatcher to radio operation and protocols and to the emergency response area(s) served before said dispatcher begins dispatching emergency calls. For purposes of this section, "adequate" training of a dispatcher shall be that which meets state standards, if any, or local requirements. As used herein, "local requirements" means county requirements, except that, during any time when a county-city agreement is not in effect, the fire chief of the city may set local requirements which differ from those of the county. 
(d)  Ambulance drivers shall, in addition to the requirements of this article for attendants, maintain an appropriate license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles and, if applicable, the Federal Aviation Administration.

(b)  The licensing officer or his or her designee(s) may inspect the records, facilities, transportation units, equipment and method of operations of each licensee whenever necessary and, by the licensing officer, at least annually. 
(Ord. No. NS-2041, § 2, 1-2-90)  
Sec. 14-114. - Complaints. 
The department, any user, subscriber, public safety agency or consumer who believes, or has reason to believe, that he or another party has been required to pay an excessive charge for services, received inadequate services or services provided were not in compliance with the provision of this article may file a written complaint with the department setting forth such allegations. The department shall notify the ambulance service operator of such complaint.

(Ord. No. NS-2041, § 2, 1-2-90)  
Sec. 14-115. - Variance.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 15-251. - Title. 
This article is known and may be cited as the "Cable and Video Service Providers Ordinance" of the City of Santa Ana. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01)  
Sec. 15-252. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city council finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  The development of cable and video services and systems may provide significant benefits for, and have substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. 
(2)  Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable and video services and systems, the public convenience, safety, and general welfare is best served by the city's exercise of its regulatory powers. 
(3)  This article adopts provisions that authorize the city to regulate cable and video service providers to the extent authorized by federal and state law, including but not limited to the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and applicable California statutes and regulations. 
(4)  The cable and video services that are addressed in this article include services provided by cable television systems, open video systems, master antenna television systems, satellite master antenna television systems, and other providers of video programming, whatever their technology. 
(b)  The purpose and intent of this article is to provide for the attainment of the following objectives: 
(1)  To enable the city to discharge its public trust in a manner consistent with rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition, and technological development. 
(2)  To obtain fair and reasonable compensation for the city and its residents for authorizing the private use of the public rights-of-way and public property. 
(3)  To promote competition in cable and video services, minimize unnecessary local regulation of cable and video service providers, and encourage the delivery of advanced and competitive cable and video services on the broadest possible basis to local government and to the businesses, institutions, and residents of the city. 
(4)  To establish clear local guidelines, standards, and time frames for the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of cable and video service providers. 
(5)  To encourage the deployment of advanced cable and video infrastructure that satisfies local needs, delivers enhanced government services, and provides informed consumer choices in an evolving cable and video marketplace. 
(6)  To maintain and to enhance public, educational, and governmental programming opportunities that will enable local government to communicate with its residents and to provide its residents with alternate means of disseminating information. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01)  
Sec. 15-253. - Defined terms and phrases. 
Various terms and phrases used in this article are defined below in section 15-268 of division 6. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01)  
DIVISION 2. - CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS 
 
Sec. 15-254. - Authority and findings. 
(a)  In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, reconstruct, operate, and maintain cable television systems within the city limits. 
(b)  The city council finds that the development of cable television services may provide significant benefits for, and substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city. This division 2 is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the best possible cable television services, and every franchise issued in accordance with this division 2 is intended to achieve this primary objective. It is the further intent of this division 2 to adopt regulatory provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable television services to the maximum extent authorized by federal and state law. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01)  
Sec. 15-255. - Franchise terms and conditions. 
(a)  Franchise purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this division 2 may authorize the grantee to do the following: 
(1)  To engage in the business of providing cable television services that are authorized by law and that grantee elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service area. 
(2)  To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets and public ways within the designated franchise service area. 
(3)  To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification, and distribution of television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such other services as may be authorized by law. 
(b)  Franchise required. 
(1)  It is unlawful for any person to construct, install, or operate a cable television system within any street or public way in the city without first obtaining either a city franchise under the provisions of this division 2, or a state video franchise under division 6 of this chapter 15. 
(2)  The city council finds and determines that certain multichannel video programming distributors and video providers, as those terms are defined in section 15-268 of division 6, provide cable service, including video programming, to subscribers within limited geographic areas where multifamily dwelling complexes and congregate-living complexes are located. That cable service, including video programming, is sometimes provided, in whole or in part, by the transmission of signals over wires or lines that are owned or controlled by telecommunications service providers or other public utilities and that are within or cross streets or public ways within the boundaries of a local franchising authority. The multichannel video programming distributor or video provider may obtain from the telecommunications service provider or other public utility, by lease, license, or similar contractual arrangement, the right to use those wires or lines in order to provide cable service, including video programming, to subscribers or customers within the multi-family dwelling complexes and congregate-living complexes referenced above. The city council further finds and determines that these contractual arrangements for signal transmission facilitate the provision of cable service, including video programming, and create a nexus between that cable service and the use of the streets and public ways of the city. Consequently, to the maximum extent authorized under state law, it is the intent of the city council to subject multi-channel video programming distributors and video providers that intend to use this signal-transmission methodology to the franchise requirements set forth in this division 2, subject to such waivers and modifications of those requirements as may, in the discretion of the city council or its designee, be warranted in view of the limited geographic area that is proposed to be served. 
(c)  Term of the franchise. 
(1)  A franchise granted under this division 2 will be for the term specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the ordinance adopted by the city council that authorizes the franchise. 
(2)  A franchise granted under this division 2 may be renewed upon application by the grantee in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of state and federal law and of this division 2. 
(d)  Franchise service area. A franchise is effective within the territorial limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the article granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  Federal or state jurisdiction. This division 2 will be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this article, to the extent authorized by applicable law. 
(f)  Franchise non-transferable. 
(1)  Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the city council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the written consent of the city council is null and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection. 
(2)  The requirements of subsection (1) apply to any change in control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a partnership or a corporation, prior written authorization of the city council is required where ownership or control of twenty (20) percent or more of the partnership interests or of the voting stock of grantee, or any company in the tier of companies controlling the grantee, whether directly or indirectly, is acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom, individually or collectively, owns or controls those partnership interests or that voting stock of the grantee, or of grantee's upper tier of controlling companies, as of the effective date of the franchise. 
(3)  Grantee must give prior written notice to the city of any proposed foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee's franchise property. That notification will be considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise will take place, and the provisions of this paragraph that require the prior written consent of the city council to that change in control of ownership will apply. 
(4)  For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both, must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent. This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to remedy all then-existing defaults and deficiencies, and, during the remaining term of the franchise, to operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements. If the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the proposed transferee are determined to be satisfactory, then the city will consent to the transfer of the franchise. 
(5)  Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system upon grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within ninety (90) days after assuming control. The plan must ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one (1) year unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee. 
(6)  Grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise. These expenses include, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation expenses. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise. 
(g)  Geographical coverage. 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee must design, construct, and maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit and commercial building in the city, subject to any service-area line extension requirements set forth in the franchise agreement. 
(2)  After service has been established by activating trunk or distribution cables for any service area, grantee must provide service to any requesting subscriber within that activated part of the service area within seven (7) days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way and permits necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that seven-day period. 
(h)  Nonexclusive franchise. Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system that it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise is proposed to be granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held if required under the provisions of Government Code Section 53066.3. 
(i)  Multiple franchises. 
(1)  The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and the following specific local considerations: 
a.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage. 
b.  The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service. 
c.  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city's opinion, the streets or public ways in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate additional cables. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01; Ord. No. NS-2774, § 2, 9-2-08)

(c)  Consideration of initial applications. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for an initial franchise, the city manager or the city manager's designee must prepare a report and make recommendations to the city council concerning that application. 
(2)  A public hearing will be noticed prior to any initial franchise grant, at a time and date approved by the city council. Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the city council will make a decision based upon documents and testimony received at the hearing as to whether the franchise should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The city council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
(d)  Franchise renewal. Franchise renewals will be processed in accordance with then-applicable law and with the renewal terms, if any, of the franchise agreement. The city and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. A renewal application fee deposit in an amount established by resolution of the city council must accompany the renewal application or the renewal request. That renewal application fee deposit will cover all anticipated costs associated with reviewing and processing the renewal application, including the review of grantee's prior compliance with the franchise, the ascertainment of the community's cable-related needs and interests, the engagement of technical and legal consultants, and expenses related to negotiations and document preparation.

(4)  As used in this subsection, the term "normal operating conditions" means those service conditions that are within the control of the cable operator. Conditions that are not within the control of the cable operator include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Conditions that are ordinarily within the control of the cable operator include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system. 
(b)  Service standards. 
(1)  The grantee will render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Except in emergency situations, scheduled interruptions will occur during a period of minimum use of the cable system, preferably between midnight and 6:00 a.m. Unless the scheduled interruption lasts for no more than two (2) hours and occurs between midnight and 6:00 a.m. (in which event twenty-four (24) hours prior notice must be given to the city), forty-eight (48) hours prior notice must be given to subscribers. 
(2)  The grantee will maintain a repair force of technicians who will respond to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames:

(3)  The grantee will be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this subsection when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on a problem that cannot be corrected from a remote location. If a subscriber is not home when the technician arrives, the technician must leave written notification of arrival. 
(4)  The grantee may not charge for the repair or replacement of defective or malfunctioning equipment provided by the grantee to subscribers, unless the defect or malfunction was caused by the subscriber. 
(5)  The grantee must determine the nature of the problem within twenty-four (24) hours after commencing work and resolve all cable system related problems within three (3) business days, unless technically infeasible. 
(c)  Billing and information standards.

Subscribers must not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure attributable to the grantee, including the failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber. 
(3)  In case of a billing dispute, the grantee must respond in writing to a written complaint from a subscriber within ten (10) days after receiving the complaint at the office specified on the billing statement for receiving that complaint. 
(4)  Upon request by a subscriber, credits or refunds must be provided by grantee to subscribers who experience an outage, interruption, or disconnection of service of four (4) or more consecutive hours, provided that such loss of service is neither caused by the subscriber nor attributable to scheduled repairs, maintenance, or construction in circumstances where grantee has provided advance written notice to a subscriber, and the loss of service does not exceed the time period specified by grantee. For subscribers terminating service, credits or refunds must be issued promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after the return of any grantee-supplied equipment. 
(5)  The grantee must provide written information on each of the following matters at the time of the installation of service, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon request:

Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of those changes if the change is within the control of the grantee. In addition, grantee will endeavor to notify the city of those changes at least five (5) working days before subscribers are notified. 
(7)  The grantee must maintain a public file containing all notices provided to subscribers under these consumer protection and service standards and all published promotional offers made by grantee to subscribers. These documents must be maintained for a minimum period of two (2) years. 
(d)  Verification of compliance with standards. 
(1)  Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, the city may require the grantee to provide a written report demonstrating its compliance with any of the consumer service standards specified in this section. The grantee must provide sufficient documentation to enable the city to verify compliance. 
(2)  A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the consumer protection and service standards of this section, after the grantee's receipt of written notice and an opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement. 
(3)  With regard to the grantee's telephone response obligations set forth above in subsections a.c. of subsection 15-258(a)(1), if the city gives written notice to grantee that grantee is in violation of any of these obligations, then upon city's request the grantee must submit summary information on either a monthly or a quarterly basis until such time as Grantee has demonstrated compliance for two (2) consecutive calendar quarters. 
(e)  Subscriber complaints and disputes. 
(1)  The grantee must establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing, specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee must file a copy of these procedures with the city. These procedures must include a requirement that the grantee respond in writing to any written complaint from a subscriber within ten (10) days after receiving the complaint at the office specified on the billing statement for receiving that complaint, as provided for above in subsection 15-258(c)(3). 
(2)  Upon request, and subject to applicable law protecting subscriber privacy rights, the city has the right to review the grantee's response to subscriber complaints. 
(3)  All subscribers have the right to continue receiving service so long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or if the city gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee must act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service while the franchise remains in force. 
(4)  Upon a change of control of the grantee, or if a new operator acquires the cable system, the original grantee must cooperate with the city, the new grantee, or the new operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During that transition period, the grantee is entitled to the revenues derived from its operation of the cable system. 
(f)  Disconnection/downgrades. 
(1)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time, and the grantee must promptly comply with the subscriber's request within seven (7) days or at any later time requested by the subscriber. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of subscribers. Grantee will impose no charges for the voluntary termination of service unless a service call to the subscriber's premises is required to remove a converter box or other equipment or property owned by grantee. 
(2)  Grantee may, in accordance with applicable law, charge a reasonable fee to downgrade service. 
(3)  The grantee may disconnect a subscriber's service in compliance with paragraphs (i), (j), and (k) of Section 53088.2 of the California Government Code. If service is disconnected for nonpayment of past due fees or charges, the grantee must promptly reinstate service upon payment in full by the subscriber of all such fees and charges, including late charges. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (3) above, immediately disconnect service to a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the grantee's cable system or equipment. 
(5)  The grantee may also disconnect service to a subscriber when it causes signal leakage exceeding federal limits. If service is disconnected, the grantee will immediately resume service without charge upon the satisfactory correction of the signal leakage problem if the signal leakage problem is attributable to the grantee. 
(6)  The grantee may also disconnect service in those cases where customers are stealing service or have threatened grantee's personnel with physical violence. 
(7)  Upon termination of service to a subscriber, the grantee will remove its equipment from the subscriber's premises within thirty (30) days. The equipment will be deemed abandoned if it is not removed within such time period unless the grantee has been denied access to the subscriber's premises. 
(g)  Negative option billing prohibited. No charge may be imposed for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively selected. Payment of the regular monthly bill will not by itself constitute an affirmative selection. 
(h)  Deposits. Grantee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers. Such deposits must be placed in an interest-bearing account. The deposit must be returned, with interest earned to the date of repayment, within thirty (30) days after the equipment is returned to the grantee. 
(i)  Parental control option. Grantee must provide parental control devices at no charge to all subscribers who desire to block the video or audio portion of any pay channels providing adult programming that the subscriber finds objectionable. For other programming, such devices will be provided at a reasonable charge to the subscriber. 
(j)  Additional requirements. 
(1)  All officers, agents, and employees of the grantee, or of its contractors or subcontractors, who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public, or who require entry onto subscribers' premises, must display a photo identification card. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. All vehicles of the grantee or its subcontractors must be clearly identified as vehicles engaged in providing services for the grantee. 
(2)  Additional standards relating to service, consumer protection, and response by the grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this section may be adopted by ordinance, and the grantee must comply with those standards in the operation of the cable television system. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement, provided that the grantee receives written notice and an opportunity to cure before any penalty or other remedy is imposed. 
(k)  Penalties for noncompliance. The purpose of this paragraph is to authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for the violation of the customer service standards established by this section. The imposition of penalties authorized by this subsection (k) will not prevent the city or any other affected party from exercising any other remedy to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to any judicial remedy as provided below in subsection (3), below. 
(1)  Administration and appeals. 
a.  The city manager or the city manager's designee is authorized to administer this subsection. Decisions by the city manager to assess monetary penalties against the grantee must be in writing and must contain findings supporting the decisions. Decisions by the city manager are final, unless appealed to the city council in accordance with the procedures specified in chapter 3. 
b.  If the grantee or any interested person is aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, the aggrieved party may appeal that decision in writing to the city council in accordance with the procedures specified in chapter 3. The appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the city council for processing the appeal. 
(2)  Schedule of penalties. The following schedule of monetary penalties may be assessed against the grantee for the material violation of the provisions of the customer service standards set forth in this section, provided that the violation is within the reasonable control of the grantee: 
a.  The maximum penalty for a first material violation is two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each day of the material violation. 
b.  For a second material violation of the same nature within a 12-month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty has been assessed, the maximum penalty is five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day of the material violation. 
c.  For a third or further material violation of the same nature within a 12-month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty has been assessed, the maximum penalty is seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each day of the material violation. 
(3)  Judicial remedy. This paragraph does not preclude any affected party from pursuing any judicial remedy available to that party without regard to this subsection. 
(4)  Notice of violation. The city must give the grantee written notice of any alleged violation of the consumer service standards and allow the grantee at least thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to remedy the specified violation. 
(5)  Assessment of monetary penalties. If a violation has not been corrected or cured by grantee within the time specified by the city, the monetary penalties specified above in subsection (2) may be assessed from the date of delivery to grantee of the city's written notice of violation. 
(6)  In assessing monetary penalties under this paragraph (k), the city manager may take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the grantee, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, and such other matters as may be relevant. If warranted under the circumstances, the monetary penalty to be assessed may be less than the maximum penalty amount specified in subsection (2). 
(l)  Additional consumer protection and service standards. 
(1)  In addition to the consumer protection and service standards that are specified above in paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section, the franchise agreement with a grantee may require compliance with the following: 
a.  Federal statutes, and the rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Communications Commission, including the following: the provisions of Section 76.309(c) of Title 47 Federal Regulations, as it now exists or may later be amended; the provisions of Section 76.630 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as it now exists or may later be amended; and, the provisions of Section 551 of Title 47, United States Code, as it now exists or may later be amended.

These standards will apply, to the extent authorized by law, to all video, voice, and data services that are provided by grantee to its subscribers within the franchise service area.

The commencement of those negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. NS-2468, 6-4-01)  
Sec. 15-262. - Agreement required. 
(a)  No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written agreement, which may be designated as a franchise, setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city. 
(b)  The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted by federal law or regulations: 
(1)  The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or extension. 
(2)  The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city, at specified times and in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under Section 622 of the Communications Act, fees on the gross revenue received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and procedures: 
a.  The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be the maximum amount authorized by Section 653(c)(2)(B) of the Communications Act, which is the rate imposed by the city on the existing franchised cable operator. 
b.  The term "gross revenue" means: 
1.  All gross revenue received by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenue received from subscribers and all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video programming providers; and 
2.  All advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the incumbent franchised cable operator. 
The term "gross revenue" does not include revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers. 
(3)  The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenue that are required to be paid as specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
(4)  The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city's requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures apply: 
a.  The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational, and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its system overlaps. 
b.  The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the franchise service area in which the city's subscribers are located. 
c.  The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to establish the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment. These negotiations may include the city's franchised cable operator if the city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire. 
d.  If the open video system operator and the city are unable to reach an agreement regarding the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment within the city's jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be imposed: 
1.  The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational, and governmental access obligations as the city's franchised cable operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, educational, and governmental access and by matching the city's franchised cable operator's annual financial contributions in support of public, educational, and governmental access services, facilities, and equipment that are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city's franchised cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator's depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act. 
2.  The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system operator's use of channel capacity designated for public, educational, and governmental access use when that capacity is not being used for such purposes. 
e.  The city's franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public, educational, and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city may require that the connection occur on city-owned property or on public rights-of-way. 
f.  All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator's public, educational, and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video system operator's matching financial contributions set forth above in subparagraph (iv)(A). 
g.  The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than those imposed upon the franchised cable operator. 
h.  If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator. 
i.

Such refuse service charge is imposed to provide for the continuing availability of curbside service, and shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms of said resolution regardless of actual use thereof or of any interruptions or delays in such service, except to the extent reductions or refunds may be specifically authorized or directed by the executive director of public works or his/her designee or by the executive director of finance and management services or his/her designee. 
(b)  For purposes of administrative convenience the city council may establish billing units for payment of the said service charge consisting of one (1) or more occupancies within one (1) or more parcels. The said total refuse service charge reflecting the number of billable units shall be billed as provided in section 39-20 as part of the city's regular consolidated municipal utility services account/billing statement, but shall be listed as a separate line item on the municipal utility services account/billing statement. 
(c)  A penalty of ten (10) percent shall be assessed on all unpaid refuse service charge bills thirty (30) days after the billing date. No penalty, however, will accrue until thirty (30) days after the date that the bill has been presented in accordance with section 39-20. 
(d)  The said refuse service charge and any penalties accrued for failure to make timely payment therefore shall be a civil debt owing to the city. 
(e)  In the event the occupant(s) of any property or premises, having registered a municipal utility services account and transferred municipal utility services into their own name as tenant(s), thereafter quit or otherwise vacate the premises, then responsibility for future municipal utility services charges, including refuse charges, shall revert to the municipal utility services account of the property owner in accordance with section 39-16. 
(f)  In addition to all other civil remedies for collection of such indebtedness, in the event that the owner and occupant of the premises or property receiving refuse service are the same, then said civil debt against such customer or person shall be subject to special assessment and lien against said property in the manner provided in Sections 38790.1 and 25831 of the Government Code of the State of California. Establishment of a lien against the property shall remove said refuse charge(s) from the city's regular consolidated municipal utility services account/billing statement and toll the accrual of additional penalties therefore under this section and section 39-20. 
(g)  The city shall not disconnect water utility service for failure to pay the refuse service charge, unless such failure is accompanied by a customer's failure to pay the water utility service, in which case disconnection of water utility service shall be governed by article II of chapter 39. 
(h)  Charges for bin service, roll-off container service or for collection services more frequent or more extensive than that provided in this article for curbside service shall be paid directly to the city's solid waste collection contractor in accordance with such regulations as shall be established by contract or resolution of the city council.

The new operator shall offer employment at an establishment to all qualified displaced workers. 
(b)  All new operator work hours performed by a waste services provider must be performed, to the extent feasible, by qualified displaced workers. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the new operator to create additional positions that the new operator does not need. However, prior to reducing the amount of work hours or positions utilized to perform waste disposal services at an establishment, a new operator must obtain written approval from the executive director of public works. 
(c)  A new operator shall not discharge any qualified displaced worker, except for cause, for at least one hundred eighty (180) days from the effective date of a transfer document, or the date on which the new operator actually begins operating the waste services provider, whichever is later.

(a)  No incumbent operator or new operator shall discharge or otherwise discriminate against anyone for making a complaint, participating in any city proceeding, or using any civil remedy to enforce his or her rights, or for otherwise asserting his or her rights under the ordinance from which this section derives. 
(b)  Any waiver by a qualified displaced worker of any or all of the provisions of the ordinance from which this section derives shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable, except where such waiver occurs in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. Any attempt by an incumbent operator or new operator to have a waste or recycling worker waive rights given by the ordinance from which this section derives shall constitute a willful violation of the ordinance. 
(c)  In addition to any rights and remedies which an employee might have, under any federal or state statute or regulation or municipal ordinance or regulation or at common law, any employee claiming a violation of the ordinance from which this section derives may bring an action against an incumbent operator or new operator in the Superior Court of the State of California, to enforce the provisions of this ordinance, and may seek liquidated damages, back pay, any other actual damages, reinstatement, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and any other legal or equitable relief, as permitted by law.

Such expenses shall begin to accrue at the time the enforcement officer first expends time in determining that the conditions constituting the nuisance exist on the premises and shall continue until abatement of the nuisance is completed.

The hearing officer may continue a hearing at his or her discretion for good cause. 
(b)  At the hearing, the responsible party or parties shall be entitled to present evidence to the hearing officer that the assessment of the expense of abatement is incorrect.

In the event the lien is discharged, released or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, the director shall file a notice of discharge in accordance with such section.

(b)  Permit suspension, revocation or modification. 
(1)  The city manager may suspend or revoke any permit when it is determined that: 
a.  The permittee has violated any term, condition or requirement of the permit or any applicable provision of this article; or 
b.  The permittee's discharge or the circumstances under which the discharge occurs have changed so that it is no longer appropriate to except the discharge from the prohibitions on prohibited discharge contained within this article; or 
c.  The permittee fails to comply with any schedule for compliance issued pursuant to this article; or 
d.  Any regulatory agency, including EPA or a regional water quality control board having jurisdiction over the discharge, notifies the city that the discharge should be terminated.

(1)  Limited permittee rights. Permits issued under this article are for the person or entity identified therein as the "permittee" only, and authorize the specific operation at the specific location identified in the permit. The issuance of a permit does not vest the permittee with a continuing right to discharge. 
(2)  Transfer of permits. No permit issued to any person may be transferred to allow: 
a.  A discharge to the storm water drainage system at a location other than the location stated in the original permit; or 
b.  A discharge by a person other than the person named in the permit, provided, however, that the city may approve a transfer if written approval is obtained, in advance, from the city manager.

Medical marijuana collectives shall comply with all provisions of the Santa Ana Municipal Code ("Code"), State Law, the 2008 California Attorney General Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use, and all other applicable local and state laws.

(d)  Qualified Registration Applicants will appear on the "Qualified Registration Applicant List" in the order that they are selected during the independent selection process (lottery). This list is the Waitlist. The Waitlist will become active if (1) an applicant on the RSP Eligibility List is disqualified from that List; (2) a location appearing on the RSP Eligibility List becomes available; or (3) a location not appearing on the RSP eligibility list becomes available. A Qualified Registration Applicant's ability to move from the Waitlist to the RSP Eligibility List is determined by the applicant's proposed medical marijuana collective location and the applicant's position on the Waitlist. 
(e)  A Qualified Registration Applicant that moves from the Waitlist to the RSP Eligibility List must submit a completed RSP application within three (3) months following issuance of a written notice advising the applicant of that opportunity. Failure to submit a completed RSP application by that deadline will disqualify the applicant from the RSP Eligibility List and the Waitlist.

A Qualified Registration Applicant on that Waitlist must submit a written request each year to maintain its status on the waitlist. The Director may place new applicants on the Waitlist in the order in which the new registration applications are received.

ARTICLE XIV. - HOOKAH PARLORS 
 
Sec. 18-650. - Purpose and findings. 
The city council finds that hookah parlors have been associated with increases in noise, loitering, public drinking, possession of illegal weapons, underage drinking, and arson; that hookah parlors exacerbate the inherently dangerous behavior of tobacco use around non-tobacco users; diminish the protection of children from exposure to smoking and tobacco while they increase the potential for minors to associate smoking and tobacco with a healthy lifestyle; and weaken the protection of the public from smoking and tobacco-related pollution; and that hookah parlors if allowed in the city would have adverse secondary effects on surrounding properties, including but not limited to lowering property values and introducing incompatible land uses to existing neighborhoods; and that in order to serve public health, safety, and welfare of the residents and businesses within the city, the declared purpose of this article is to prohibit hookah parlors as defined in this article.

(h)  Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may obtain judicial review of such decision in the manner provided under Section 1-21.9 of this Code. 
(i)  In the event no application for a hearing is filed within the time prescribed, the decision of the collector shall become final and conclusive on expiration of the time herein fixed for hearing and shall render any subsequent appeal null and void and shall further act as a waiver against future action.

When, by reason of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California, the business tax imposed by the provisions of this Chapter cannot be enforced as to any single class or set of classes of business or business activity without there being an apportionment according to the amount of business done in the city, or in the State of California, as the case may be, the collector, having first obtained the approval of the city attorney shall make such rules and regulations for the apportionment of the tax as are necessary or otherwise desirable to overcome the constitutional objections. 
(Ord. No. NS-1922, § 1, 7-20-87)  
Sec. 21-58. - Burden on interstate commerce; petition for adjustment. 
In any case where a license tax is claimed by a licensee, or applicant for license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce, or be violative of the constitutions of the United States and/or the State of California, he or she may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory or unreasonable as to such commerce. Such application may be made before, at, or within six (6) months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall by affidavit and supporting testimony show his or her method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of undue burden on such commerce. The collector shall then conduct an investigation and, having first obtained the approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory. If the license tax has already been paid, he or she shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector may base the license tax upon a percentage of the gross receipts of any other measure which will assure that the license tax levied shall be uniform with that levied on businesses of like nature so long as the amount levied does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this Chapter. Should the collector determine the gross receipts measure of business tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the city, or at the end of each twelve (12) month period, a verified affidavit of the gross receipts and payment of the amount of license tax therefor; provided that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee has paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this Chapter. 
The collector shall, upon proper showing contained in the verified affidavit, cause the issuance of a license to such person showing partial exemption under this section with a license tax based upon the approved reduced gross receipts. 
The collector after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to a licensee, shall revoke any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon information that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption as provided herein. 
(Ord. No. NS-1922, § 1, 7-20-87)  
Sec. 21-59. - Undue burden on intercity commerce; petition for adjustment. 
None of the license taxes provided for in this Chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon any business done in the city, where the business conducted is related to a regularly established business conducted elsewhere. In any case where a license tax is claimed by any licensee or applicant for license to place an undue burden upon such commerce, he or she may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory or unreasonable as to such commerce. Such application may be made before, at, or within six (6) months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall by affidavit and supporting testimony show his or her method of conducting business, the gross volume of business inside the city, and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of undue burden of such commerce. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the business tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory. If the license tax has already been paid, he or she shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector may base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts from business conducted inside the city or any other measure which will assure that the business tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the business tax as prescribed by this Chapter. Should the collector determine the gross receipts measure of business tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city, or at the end of each twelve (12) month period, a verified affidavit of the gross receipts and payment of the amount of license tax therefor; provided that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee has paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this Chapter. 
The collector shall, upon proper showing contained in the verified affidavit, cause the issuance of a license to such person showing partial exemption under this section with a license tax based upon the approved reduced gross receipts. 
The collector after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to licensee, shall revoke any license granted pursuant to this section upon information that the person is not entitled to the adjustment as provided herein.

Any license shall be deemed based upon the application on file, and if the information is incomplete or inaccurate, the license shall be deemed invalid. If information submitted in an application subsequently becomes incomplete or inaccurate by reason of a change in circumstances, the license shall thereafter be deemed invalid. Upon the collector's learning of any inaccuracy or incompleteness, notice shall be given forthwith to the licensee, at the address shown on the license where the licensee consented to receive information concerning his or her license, that the license is invalid and requesting the licensee to reapply for a re-validated license within thirty (30) days. 
Upon the licensee's successful application for a re-validated license within the period hereinabove set the collector shall apply pro rata to the re-validated license the remainder of the sum originally paid by the licensee. 
Upon the licensee's failure to make successful application for a re-validated license within the period hereinabove set the collector shall give notice forthwith pursuant to Section 21-86 that the licensee's license is hereby suspended.

A minimum charge is required for the processing of any initial or renewal license application. This charge shall be in addition to the business license tax and shall not be prorated.

However, if after receipt of applicant's written notification of cancellation, no required inspection or investigation has taken place pursuant to any applicable provision of this Code, and no business activity has been transacted or carried on, then in that event a refund request for all inspection or investigation fees paid exceeding fifteen dollars ($15.00) may be made pursuant to Section 21-87 subsection (d). In no event, however, shall the application processing charge be made refundable, other than as part of a refund made pursuant to Section 21-87 subsection (b). Provided further, that the collector may waive the processing charge in the case of a bonafide nonprofit, charitable, or otherwise fee-exempt licensee.

Sec. 21-63. - Statement of fee; mistake not conclusive. 
(a)  No greater or lesser amount of money shall be charged or received for any license tax other than provided for in this Chapter.

No statement shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein, nor shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable hereunder.

(a)  Except as provided in Section 21-83, subsection (b), acceptance of any partial payment of business license tax or penalty or interest owing that is less than the amount required under the terms of this Chapter shall not be construed as meeting the requirements of this Chapter. No license or sticker, decal, tag, plate or symbol shall be issued, nor shall one (1) which has been suspended or revoked be reinstated or reissued, to any person who, at the time of applying therefor, is indebted to the city for any delinquent business tax, unless such person, enters into an acceptable binding written agreement with the city to satisfy said delinquency within one (1) year. With the consent of the collector such agreements may be deferred or extended for a period exceeding one (1) year. 
(b)  The execution of any agreement to satisfy delinquent business license taxes by means of installment payments and/or deferral shall not prevent the accrual of penalties and interest as applicable on the unpaid balance as provided under the terms of this Chapter. However, such additional penalties as may accrue and the interest on such penalties shall not be applied after the execution of such agreement and the payment of the first installment and during such time as such person shall not be in breach of the agreement. Upon the timely payment of the final installment of the agreement such additional penalties and the interest thereon as may have accrued shall be waived. In any agreement so entered into, such person shall acknowledge the obligation owed the city and agree that, in the event of failure to make timely payment of any installment, the whole amount unpaid, principal together with accrued penalties and interest thereon, shall become immediately due and payable. In the event such person fails within a period of thirty (30) days thereafter to render payment in full, such person's current business license may be revoked by the collector. In the event legal action is brought by the city to enforce collection of any amount included in the agreement, such person shall pay all costs of suit incurred by the city or its assignee, including attorney fees. The execution of such an agreement shall render any subsequent appeal null and void and shall constitute a waiver against future action.

Provided however, that pursuant to Section 21-84 penalties upon attaining a combined amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent of the amount of the business license tax due are merged with the tax payable hereunder and any additional interest charged from such date on shall be charged the combined amount delinquent until paid.

Provided further, that unless revocation is made upon conditions set forth in a written agreement executed pursuant to Section 21-83, no licensee's license shall be suspended and/or revoked for failure to pay the license tax or any other amount due pursuant to this Chapter until the penalties accruing for such failure to pay, exclusive of interest, equal one hundred (100) per cent of the business license tax due for such license. Whereupon, the collector shall give a notice of suspension, which notice shall specify the grounds for suspension, and which notice shall be given by personal service or by depositing it in the United States post office in the city, postage prepaid, addressed to the licensee at the address listed on the application of the licensee where he or she consented to receive mail concerning his or her license, to obtain a license or to pay any license tax due. 
In the event said licensee fails, within a period of thirty (30) days notice, to pay the license tax due or any other amount due pursuant to this Chapter, or to request a hearing the procedure for which shall be as provided in Section 21-41, then and in that event the collector shall give a notice of revocation. The licensee shall be given at least ten (10) days notice, which notice shall specify the grounds for revocation, and which notice shall be given pursuant to the hereinabove set forth procedure for giving notice. 
In the event said licensee fails within the allotted ten (10) day period to request a hearing to show cause why his or her license should not be revoked, then and in that event the collector shall revoke said person's license and give notice thereof to said person pursuant to the hereinabove set forth procedure for giving notice. 
In the event said licensee fails to file within ten (10) days thereafter, an appeal pursuant to Chapter 3 of this Code, then the collector's action in revoking said person's license shall be conclusive as to all matters involved, and the transacting and carrying on by any person of any business pursuant to said license shall thereafter be deemed a misdemeanor.

Provided, however, that in the case of a refund made pursuant to Section 21-87 subsection (b), and where applicable, subsection (d), no deduction shall be made on account of the administrative cost therefor.

Such fee shall constitute a debt owed by the swap meet exhibitor to the city and shall be extinguished only by payment to the swap meet operator. The swap meet exhibitor shall pay the fee to the swap meet operator at the time and on each day the swap meet exhibitor participates in the swap meet. Any unpaid fee shall be paid upon the termination of the swap meet exhibitor's participation in the specific swap meet.

Returns and payments shall be due immediately upon cessation of business by the swap meet operator for any reason.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 28-1. - Findings and determinations. 
The city council of the City of Santa Ana hereby finds and determines as follows: 
(a)  The full employment of residents of the City of Santa Ana, and the prevention of unemployment and underemployment of such residents, serves a vital and compelling public interest of the City of Santa Ana and promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the city by reducing the incidence of crime, improving the mental and physical health and well-being of the city's residents, alleviating the financial drain upon limited public and private resources for welfare programs and unemployment assistance, and enhancing the financial resources of the city. 
(b)  The encouragement of industrial and commercial development within the city serves a vital and compelling public interest of the city and promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the city by increasing the employment of residents of the city, increasing the tax and revenue base and thereby enhancing the financial resources of the city, and preventing physical deterioration and abandonment of industrial and commercial areas within the city. In addition, the city's participation in the financing of such development serves the public interest by ensuring that such development will reflect the needs and objectives of the community more so than if such development were undertaken without city participation.

(d)  In the past, efforts have been made to assist industrial and commercial development and to promote local employment by state and federal agencies acting through local government. However, such efforts have generally been inadequately funded, unresponsive to local needs and objectives of the community, or have been unavailable to the city, making such efforts unsatisfactory for the city in effectuating the aforesaid public interests of the city. 
(c)  The city can promote such public interests by assisting the financing of industrial and commercial development within the city, pursuant to this chapter, without adversely affecting areas outside the boundaries of the city or transient residents of the state, and without conflicting with or in any way impairing the efforts of the state to solve problems of legitimate statewide concern. 
(f)  Encouraging industrial and commercial development pursuant to this chapter: 
(1)  Will promote the health, safety and welfare of the city, including those public interests enumerated in subsection (a) and subsection (b) hereof, and will improve the social, moral, economic and physical condition of the community thereby, and 
(2)  Constitutes a municipal affair of the City of Santa Ana, a valid exercise of the police powers of the City of Santa Ana, and a public purpose in which the City of Santa Ana has a peculiar and unique interest.

ARTICLE III. - EXCAVATIONS 
 
Sec. 33-58. - Reserved. 
Editor's note Ord. No. NS-2480, § 2, adopted October 15, 2001, repealed § 33-58 in its entirety. Formerly, § 33-58 pertained to bond or insurance and derived from Code 1952, § 7300.  
Sec. 33-59. - Purpose of trench cut fee. 
Excavations in paved streets owned and maintained by the city degrade and shorten the life of the surface of the streets, and this degradation increases the frequency and cost to the public of necessary resurfacing, maintenance and repair. It is appropriate that entities responsible for excavating into the city's right-of-way bear this burden rather than the taxpayers of the city. In addition, establishment of a trench cut fee will create an incentive for coordination of efforts in excavating the streets to lay utilities. 
(Ord. No. NS-2480, § 3, 10-15-01) 
Editor's note Ord. No. NS-2480, §§ 2, 3, adopted October 15, 2001, repealed and reenacted § 33-59 to read as herein set out. Formerly, § 33-59 pertained to permits and derived from Code 1952, § 7301.  
Sec. 33-59.1. - Establishment of trench cut fee. 
No person shall excavate in the public right-of-way without, in addition to all other requirements of this Code, having first paid to the city a "trench cut fee." The amount of this trench cut fee shall be set from time to time by resolution, and shall not exceed the reasonable cost necessary to mitigate the degradation to the public streets caused by such excavation. 
(Ord. No. NS-2480, § 3, 10-15-01)  
Sec. 33-59.2. - Variance from payment of trench cut fee. 
Any person subject to the trench cut fee may request that the director waive the requirement of payment of the trench cut fee due to individual circumstances that demonstrate, on a case-by-case basis, that the amount of the fee is not reasonably related to the projected impact of the proposed excavation. 
(Ord. No. NS-2480, § 3, 10-15-01)  
Sec. 33-59.3. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Excavations in streets scheduled for pavement structural improvements in the city's capital improvement construction schedule within one (1) year of the date of excavation shall be exempt from the trench cut fee. The public works agency shall endeavor to notify public utilities of streets so scheduled. 
(b)  No trench cut fee shall be charged for underground utility district projects, utility line relocations necessitated by city street work projects or by street vacations or abandonments. 
(c)  No trench cut fee shall be charged with respect to excavation in a sidewalk or a concrete street. 
(Ord. No. NS-2480, § 3, 10-15-01)  
Sec. 33-59.4. - Utility master plans. 
Any utility owning, operating or installing in city streets, alleys, sidewalks, or any other public places facilities providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services, shall prepare and submit to the director a utility master plan, in a format specified by the director, that shows the location of the utility's existing facilities in city streets, alleys, sidewalks, and other public places, and shows all of the utility's planned major utility work in city streets, alleys, sidewalks and other public places for the next five (5) years. Utilities shall submit an initial utility master plan no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section. Thereafter, each utility shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of July, a revised and updated utility master plan. As used in this subsection, the term "planned major utility works" refers to any and all future excavations planned by the utility when the utility master plan or update is submitted that will affect any city street, alley, sidewalk, or other public place for more than fifteen (15) days, provided that the utility shall not be required to show future excavations planned to occur more than five (5) years after the date that the utility master plan or update is submitted. Any and all utility master plans submitted pursuant to this section shall be confidential to the fullest extent provided by law and used solely for purposes of coordination. 
(Ord. No. NS-2480, § 3, 10-15-01)  
Sec. 33-59.5 - Coordination with city. 
(a)  Prior to applying for an excavation permit in the city's streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public places the city shall review on behalf of the applicant the utility master plans and the city's five (5) year repaving plan on file with the director. The applicant shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of such streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public places. Such coordination shall include: 
(1)  Whenever two (2) or more parties (i.e., the city or any utility) have proposed a major excavation in the same block during a five (5) year period, they shall meet and confer with the city regarding whether it is feasible to conduct a joint operation. If the director determines that it is feasible to conduct a joint operation, a single contractor shall be selected and a single application fee charged. 
(2)  Any utility aggrieved by the director's decision to require a joint operation may, within thirty (30) days of the director's written notice, file an appeal pursuant to Chapter 3 of this Code. In determining such appeal, the hearing officer or council shall consider the impact of the proposed excavation on the neighborhood, the applicant's need to provide services to a property or area, facilitating the deployment of new technology as directed pursuant to official city policy, and the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience. 
(b)  To avoid future excavations and to reduce the number of street excavations, telecommunication companies shall be requested, when practical, to install spare conduits.

Cross reference For permit fee see § 33-31(e).

All persons digging the surface of any street of the city shall by proper means repair the street so as to comply with article II of this chapter. 
(Code 1952, § 7302)  
Sec. 33-61. - Appeal to council. 
Should any person be aggrieved by any act of the director of public works under this article after notice given to the director of public works, such person may appeal to the council. Such appeal shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 3 of this Code. 
(Code 1952, § 7303; Ord. No. NS-1235, § 13, 12-9-74)  
Sec. 33-62. - Excavations under streets. 
No person shall construct or excavate any basement, elevator, elevator shaft, tunnel or other excavation, under any public street in the city beyond a point one-half the distance from the property line abutting such street to the curb of such street. 
The provisions of this section do not apply to temporary excavations in or under the public streets permitted by other provisions of this Code, nor do they apply to public utilities excavating in or under the city streets, under the valid exercise of a city franchise.

ARTICLE VIII. - PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION RULES AND REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 33-200. - Purposes. 
(a)  These rules and regulations for the contracting of public works construction services are to comply with section 421 of the city charter to: 
(1)  Establish efficient procedures for construction of public works; 
(2)  Distinguish between traditional public works construction and other more innovative modes of project management and project delivery which still comply with the city's charter; and 
(3)  Establish procedures to allow for the efficient and fair construction of public works without favor or prejudice. 
(b)  The city council finds that the city's charter, including but not limited to sections 200 and 421, conflict with existing state law set forth in the California Public Contract Code. Said charter provisions, this article and the administrative procedures adopted by the executive director of public works pursuant to section 33-204, are intended, and shall be interpreted, to constitute a complete statement of the city's public works construction rules and regulations. The city council declares there exists a fundamental conflict between the city's charter, ordinances, administrative rules and regulations, on the one hand, and the California Public Contract Code provisions regulating public works construction, on the other hand, both generally and specifically. This conflict infringes on the city's constitutional authority to govern its municipal affairs. The city council intends to and does hereby exempt public works construction from being subject to any provision of the California Public Contract Code, except to the extent that any such provisions may be expressly incorporated in applicable administrative procedures.

Sec. 33-211. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Many retail establishments provide shopping carts for the convenience of customers while shopping on the establishment's premises. However, shopping carts removed from the premises of these establishments and left abandoned on public or private property throughout the city constitute a public nuisance and a potential hazard to the health and safety of the public. The proliferation of lost, stolen, wrecked or abandoned shopping carts on public and private property: 
(1)  Create conditions that reduce property values, and promote blight and deterioration of the city neighborhoods, tending to lead to declining property values and increases in crime; 
(2)  Obstruct the free passage along public and private streets, sidewalks, parking lots and other rights-of-way and/or interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on streets; 
(3)  Impede emergency service; and 
(4)  Clog storm drain channels reducing their ability to function properly, by trapping debris and trash and thereby creating flooding hazards, and constitute violation of the city's waste discharge requirements. 
(b)  For the above-referenced reasons, such lost, stolen, wrecked or abandoned shopping carts are hereby declared to be a public nuisance, which shall be subject to abatement in the manner set forth in this article or in any other manner provided by law. 
(c)  The purpose of this article is to set forth regulations to ensure that reasonable measures are taken by owners of businesses which provide shopping carts on their premises for the convenience of their customers to prevent the removal of shopping carts from business premises and parking lots, and, when removed despite the owner's implementation of its control pan, to provide for the prompt retrieval of such shopping carts. 
(d)  The purpose and intent of this article is additionally to ensure that measures are taken by owners to prevent the removal of shopping carts from a business premises, to make removal of shopping carts a violation of the law, and to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned shopping carts in a manner that supplements and complements state law, but is not preempted with state law.

The use of private streets will be subject to review and approval by the planning commission and the city council. 
(2)  Private streets shall be identified as "private vehicle access ways" rather than bear a street connotation and should be known as "commons." 
(3)  Private streets will be permitted only where a satisfactory means of providing for their maintenance and operation is demonstrated. 
(4)  The homeowners' association shall be required to contract with the city whereby the city can maintain the access way, and collect the cost thereof in the event the association does not maintain them adequately. 
(5)  The homeowners' association constitution, by-laws or covenants-conditions-restrictions shall include acknowledgment of the ownership and maintenance responsibility of these private facilities. 
(6)  The use of private streets as a device for permitting inadequate design will not be allowed. 
(7)  The entire width of the access way should be dedicated to the city as a public utilities easement. 
(8)  The use of private streets is limited to cul-de-sacs and to minor local streets not carrying through traffic. Curvilinear or loop street configurations are encouraged. 
(9)  The design of all private streets shall be in accordance with city standards and shall be reviewed by and subject to the approval of the city engineer and the construction shall be inspected by the public works department, with a standard inspection fee to be paid. 
(10)  The following design standards shall be used. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  Where streets other than minor local streets (alley or driveway type) are proposed to be private, the design shall conform in all respects to the requirements established for public streets, except as may be otherwise permitted under number two below. 
(2)  Where special circumstances exist, deviations from the standards will be subject to approval by the city engineer individual review. 
(3)  Streets shall be designed to provide for adequate lane delineation, street sweeping and drainage control. Normally a standard crown section with concrete curb and gutter on both sides will be required; however, other means of providing similar functional characteristics may be considered. 
(4)  Depressed approaches shall be used at all driveways where streets have curb and gutter. 
(5)  Concrete sidewalks shall be provided reasonably adjacent to the roadway unless other means of accommodating pedestrian traffic are provided in the development. 
(6)  Lighting adequate for pedestrian and vehicle safety and sufficient to minimize police problems shall be provided. The level of illumination for pedestrian and vehicular safety shall be as approved by the public works department. All lighting power costs shall be borne by the homeowners' association. 
(7)  All area and street lighting shall have underground service. 
(8)  Adequate provision for public and private utilities shall be made in accordance with current approved standard plan for private streets. A separate document dedicating exclusive public utility easements to the city shall be provided when required, in order to eliminate any conflict of rights between city utilities and other public utilities. 
(9)  Where it is proposed to reduce street widths by the elimination of curbside parking, equivalent parking shall be provided by other means, subject to approval by the city. 
(10)  Provision shall be made for trash pick-up vehicles and emergency vehicle access as required by the department of public works. 
(11)  Signs, subject to the approval of the city, shall be provided and maintained at all entrances to private streets clearly designating the private status of such streets and the street names. 
(b)  Minimum widths. 
(1)  With parking on both sides: Thirty-six (36) feet curb to curb. 
(2)  With parking on one side only: Thirty-two (32) feet curb to curb. 
(3)  Without parking: Twenty-eight (28) feet curb to curb. 
(c)  Grades. 
(1)  Desirable maximum: Six (6) percent. 
(2)  Maximum: Six (6) percent for special circumstances with approval by the public works department. 
(3)  Minimum: Two-tenths (0.2) percent. 
(4)  Provide vertical curves for grade breaks over one (1) percent. 
(d)  Alignment. 
(1)  Streets shall normally intersect at right angles and shall have at least twenty (20) feet of tangent adjacent to intersections. The tangent length shall be increased where short radius curves are used near the intersections. 
(2)  Culs-de-sac shall not ordinarily exceed five hundred (500) feet in length. Curb radius at the turnaround shall be at least forty (40) feet. 
(3)  Center line radius shall be one hundred and fifty (150) feet minimum. Where right angles bends are used in the street pattern in lieu of the minimum radii required above, widening sufficient to accommodate truck turning movements shall be provided by use of knuckles or other appropriate means. 
(4)  Curb return radius shall be twenty-five (25) feet minimum. 
(5)  No more than one turn shall be utilized in dead-ended access ways. 
(e)  Structural section. 
(1)  The minimum structural section shall ordinarily be six (6) of asphalt concrete over ninety five (95) percent compacted subgrade. The section shall be required by accepted standards of engineering design in accordance with the results of soil tests on the native subgrade material. 
(11)  The city will assume no responsibility for enforcement of traffic control unless specifically requested and approved by resolution of the city council. 
(12)  The policies and standards are to be reviewed and revised as needed based on continuing experience with the use of private streets. 
(13)  Private streets shall be monumented by a registered land surveyor or civil engineer in the same manner as would be required for the development of a public street. 
(14)  Street names for private streets shall be submitted for approval by the planning commission in order to prevent duplication of any existing street names. 
(15)  The design of all private streets shall be in accordance with the City standard and shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. The construction shall be inspected by the Public Works Agency and all standard inspection fees shall be paid by the subdivider.

ARTICLE VIII. - REGULATIONS FOR DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PARK OR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES 
 
Sec. 34-200. - Purpose. 
This article is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Subdivision Map Act, for the purpose of requiring the dedication of land for park and recreational element of the general plan of the City of Santa Ana. 
(Ord. No. NS-1195, § 1, 3-11-74; Ord. No. NS-1253, § 5, 3-10-75; Ord. No. NS-1526, § 7, 4-21-80)  
Sec. 34-201. - Requirements. 
As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map for any subdivision containing more than fifty (50) parcels proposed for residential use, the subdivider may be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes at the time of approval of such final map according to the standards contained in this article. 
(Ord. No. NS-1195, § 1, 3-11-74; Ord. No. NS-1526, § 8, 4-21-80)  
Sec. 34-202. - Standards. 
Dedication of land shall be required under this article if the city council finds and determines that the park or recreational facilities which the dedication is to provide are in accordance with definite principles and standards contained in the recreational element of the general plan of the City of Santa Ana, and that the amount and location of the land to be dedicated bears a reasonable relationship to the use of the park or recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. Such findings, if made, shall be adopted by resolution of the city council at the time of approval of the tentative map, which resolution shall also contain a schedule specifying how and when the city will use the land to develop park or recreational facilities. 
The requirement for dedication of land pursuant to this article is found to be necessary to promote the general standard of providing two (2) acres of property devoted to parks and recreational purposes for each thousand (1,000) persons residing within the City of Santa Ana. The standards set forth in section 34-204 shall determine the maximum proportion of any single subdivision which may be required to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes when such requirement is otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. NS-1195, § 1, 3-11-74; Ord. No. NS-1526, § 9, 4-21-80)  
Sec. 34-203. - Definitions. 
(a)  For purposes of this article, the term "recreational element of the general plan of the City of Santa Ana" shall mean either of the following: 
(i)  The open space element, as included in the "Land Use and Arterial Streets" portion of the general plan of the City of Santa Ana. Any requirement for dedication of land pursuant to this article shall be deemed to be in accordance with definite principles and standards contained therein, if such land is designated therein for "parks, recreational, and open space" use. 
(ii)  Such other definite principles and standards for the locations and proposed development of parks, parkways, playgrounds, and other recreation areas as may be included in the general plan of the City of Santa Ana. 
(b)  For purposes of section 34-204, the term "dwelling unit" means any single-family dwelling or any separate occupancy unit within a duplex, multifamily building, or apartment complex, or separate ownership parcels within a mobile home park. Only the increase in the number of dwelling units on the land included within a subdivision shall be counted in determining the amount of land to be dedicated. 
(Ord. No. NS-1195, § 1, 3-11-74; Ord. No. NS-1526, § 10, 4-21-80)  
Sec. 34-204. - Standards and formula for dedication of land. 
The formula for determining land to be dedicated shall be as follows: 
	Assumed 	Assumed 	Land to be Dedicated 
Dwelling Unit 
Type 	Density 
per Acre 	Persons 
per Unit 	Per Dwelling Unit 
			Acres 	Square Feet 
Single-family 	3 to 7.3 	4.0 	.008 	348.5 
Duplexes 	8.14 	3.0 	.006 	261.4 
Multifamily 	variable 	2.4 	.005 	209.1 
 
The basis for determining the total number of dwelling units shall be the maximum number of units permitted by the city on the property included in the subdivision, exclusive of parts to be dedicated, as of the time of filing of the tentative map.

Said sections were derived from Ord. No. NS-1195, § 1, adopted March 11, 1974.  
Sec. 34-210. - Partial credit for private open space. 
Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed twenty-five (25) per cent may be given against the requirement of land dedication if the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met: 
(a)  That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
(b)  That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or restrictions; and 
(c)  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs in the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; and

ARTICLE X. - INVESTMENT APARTMENTS 
 
Sec. 34-360. - Application and purpose. 
This article applies to investment apartments. It is the purpose of this article to allow a form of ownership of rental multiple family housing combining separate ownership of rental dwelling units with common ownership by the associated unit owners of the land and buildings where such units are located, in the expectation that such form of ownership will promote a higher degree of ownership concern for property maintenance than is commonly associated with multifamily rental housing. It is further the purpose of this article to assure that, prior to their conversion to investment apartments, rental multifamily developments are, to the extent feasible, upgraded to zoning and building code standards applicable to new construction in order to promote future maintenance of such developments. 
(Ord. No. NS-2088, § 3, 1-7-91)  
Sec. 34-361. - Application of the general plan. 
Because the conversion of apartments to investment apartments does not result in a reduction in the city's supply of rental housing, any provision in the general plan of the city which is designed to restrict the conversion of apartments to condominiums or other form of common ownership project shall be deemed not to apply to investment apartments. 
(Ord. No. NS-2088, § 3, 1-7-91)  
Sec. 34-362. - Tentative map requirements. 
(a)  Any application for approval of a tentative map for investment apartments shall be accompanied by a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions approved in accordance with section 34-363 and an improvements plan approved in accordance with section 34-364. Any application for approval of a tentative map for a conversion project which is not accompanied by such documents shall be subject to Article IX of this chapter. 
(b)  Every tentative map for investment apartments shall be subject to the condition that the following actions be completed prior to approval of the final map: 
(1)  The improvement of the subject property in accordance with the improvement plan approved by the city in accordance with section 34-364. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining inspections of the subject property by personnel of the planning and building agency as necessary to determine compliance with this requirement. 
(2)  The filing with the planning and building agency of a current structural pest control report issued by a licensed structural pest control operator, showing the subject property to be free of termites, dry rot, fungi, and damage therefrom. Such a report shall be deemed current for no more than ninety (90) days following the date of the inspection. 
(Ord. No. NS-2088, § 3, 1-7-91)  
Sec. 34-363. - Requirement of an approved declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions. 
(a)  A declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions for investment apartments shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  No owner of a dwelling unit shall be permitted to reside in that unit, and no person shall be permitted to own fewer than two (2) units. 
(2)  The associated owners shall collectively be responsible for maintenance and management expenses of all grounds, buildings and structures on the project site, excluding only the interiors of the dwelling units and the interiors of any attached garages. As used herein, an "attached garage" means garage space which is immediately adjacent to and accessible from a dwelling unit and which is separately owned by the owner of that dwelling unit. All parking areas other than attached garages shall be owned by the associated owners collectively, although parking spaces may be assigned to the occupants of designated dwelling units. 
(3)  Provision shall be made for professional management of the investment apartment complex. This shall include provision for an on-site office staffed on a full-time basis during normal business hours. The associated owners shall be required to maintain the name and mailing address of the manager continuously on file with the planning director of the city. Provision shall be included that the service of any notice, order or summons by the city or by any court of competent jurisdiction on the manager on record with the city, or on any person actually serving as manager or on any one (1) of the associated owners, shall be valid and binding on all of the associated owners, with respect to the enforcement by the city of the subject covenants, conditions and restrictions, or of the improvement plan specified in section 34-364, or of any applicable law or regulation of the city. 
(4)  As to the above requirements, a power of enforcement to the city, exercisable in the discretion of the council, and a prohibition against any relinquishment, amendment or deletion of such requirements without the consent of the council. 
(b)  No declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be deemed adequate for the purpose of processing a tentative map for investment apartments until approved as complying with this section by the executive director of planning and building safety or his or her designated representative. The said executive director shall cooperate with the department of real estate of the state to assure the covenants, conditions and restrictions as finally recorded are consistent with those approved by the said executive director with regard to the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. NS-2088, § 3, 1-7-91)  
Sec. 34-364. - Improvement plan. 
(a)  The improvement plan referenced in section 34-362 shall provide for upgrading the proposed investment apartment complex to the standards then in effect for construction of new buildings, to the extent financially and practically feasible, with regard to the following matters: fire safety, building security, sound transmission, energy efficiency, off-street parking, open space and landscaping. The improvement plan shall also provide for all existing on-site facilities which are to be retained to be brought into reasonably sound and attractive condition.

(c)  No improvement plan shall be deemed adequate for purposes of processing a tentative map for investment apartments until approved by the executive director of planning and building safety or his or her designated representatives as complying with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining an inspection of the subject property by appropriate personnel in the planning and building agency of the city as necessary to determine the improvements to be required on the subject property. In approving any improvement plan, the executive director may impose such requirements and conditions as he or she deems appropriate to render such improvement plan consistent with the requirements of this section. Any such requirements or conditions may be appealed by the applicant to the planning commission, which may modify them as such commission deems appropriate, and the decision of the planning commission shall be final. 
(Ord. No. NS-2088, § 3, 1-7-91)

(b)  The boundaries of the parcels to be merged are contiguous, well-defined in existing recorded documents or filed maps and were legally created or have certificates of compliance issued on them. If the finding under subsection (b) cannot be made, the executive director may nevertheless authorize the merger of two or more parcels of land of which at least one was not created in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and/or local ordinances as an alternative to the issuance of a conditional certificate of compliance. 
(c)  The merger will not alter the exterior boundary of the parcels to be merged.

(e)  The parcels to be merged are under common ownership.

(g)  The parcels, if merged, would be consistent with the city's general plan and chapter 41.

(Ord. No. NS-2697, § 2, 10-3-05)  
Sec. 34-369. - Effect of voluntary merger. 
The filing of said merger and certificate of merger for record shall constitute a merger of the separate parcels into one parcel for the purpose of the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, and the parcels shall thereafter be treated in all respects as a single parcel. 
(Ord. No. NS-2697, § 2, 10-3-05)

ARTICLE V. - HOTEL VISTORS' TAX[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. NS-2648, § 2, adopted April 5, 2004, changed the title of article V from "Transient Occupancy Tax" to "Hotel Visitors Tax." 
 
Sec. 35-125. - Title. 
This article shall be known as "The Hotel Visitors Tax Ordinance of the City of Santa Ana." 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 2, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-126. - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this article: 
(a)  Person. The term "person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
(b)  Hotel. The term "hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by hotel visitors for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
(c)  Occupancy. The term "occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
(d)  Hotel visitors. The term "hotel visitors" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a hotel visitors until after the 30th consecutive day of such occupancy and said tax shall continue to be due upon all rent collected or accruing prior to said 30th day of occupancy unless such occupancy is pursuant to a qualifying rental agreement as defined in this article. In determining whether a person is a hotel visitors, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this article may be considered. 
(e)  Rent. The term "rent" means the total consideration charged to the hotel visitors as shown on the guest receipt for the occupancy of space in a hotel, including charges for equipment (such as rollaway beds, cribs and television set, etc.), and in-room services (such as movies and other services not subject to state taxes), valued in money, whether received or to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise. It shall include all receipts, cash, credit, property and services of any kind or nature without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. The costs of additional goods and services, which are not "rent," but which may be sold as a package with the room (such as meals, excursions, and recreational services), must be accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the finance director. 
(f)  Operator. The term "operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
(g)  Qualifying rental agreement. The term "qualifying rental agreement" means and shall be limited to a written contract signed by both the landlord and tenant, legally enforceable by either party thereto, and for a rental period of not less than thirty (30) consecutive days. Notwithstanding any other provision thereof, the term "qualifying rental agreement" as used in this article shall expressly exclude: 
(1)  Any agreement regardless of rental term which is terminated for any reason by either party thereto, or by mutual consent, prior to the 30th consecutive day of tenancy, or 
(2)  Any agreement regardless of length of rental term which would be unlawful or constitute a violation of any provision of law. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 3, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-127. - Tax imposed. 
(a)  For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eleven (11) per cent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owned by the transient to the city that is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the finance director may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the finance director. 
(b)  In the event that a qualifying rental agreement exists between the hotel and any person for occupancy, as hereinabove defined, for a period in excess of thirty (30) days and in the event that such person allows occupancy by another person as subtenant, guest, licensee or permittee, the person who has made the agreement with the hotel as aforesaid shall be subject to and shall pay the tax provided for herein. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-1694, § 1, 8-15-83; Ord. No. NS-1921, § 1, 7-20-87; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 4, 4-5-04; Ord. No. NS-2673, § 1, 11-2-04; Ord. No. NS-2673, § 1, 11-2-04)  
Sec. 35-128. - Exemptions. 
No tax shall be imposed upon: 
(a)  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
(b)  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty; 
(c)  Any federal or state officer or employee while on official business only and when payment for such occupancy is made directly to the operator by duly authorized voucher payment from a governmental accounting office. This exemption does not exempt a hotel visitors who is employed by the United States government or the state or their respective instrumentalities from payment of the tax when the payment is later to be reimbursed by the United States government or the state or their respective instrumentalities. 
No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefore made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the finance director. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 5, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-129. - Operator's duties. 
(a)  Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this article to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every hotel visitors. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each hotel visitors shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. Each operator shall account separately for and maintain separate monthly summary totals for taxable and nontaxable rents and for taxes collected. 
(b)  The operator shall maintain its financial and accounting records in accordance with established accounting principles acceptable to the finance director. In the event the operator offers paid packages or complementary services to guests, the charges shall be accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the finance director. 
(c)  The tax required to be collected (any amount unreturned to the hotel visitors which is not tax but was collected under the representation that it was tax) constitutes a debt owed by the operator to the city and shall be paid to the city with the monthly remittance. 
(d)  Whenever an operator who has collected any sum under the representation that it was a tax, which sum is not required to be collected as a tax, remits said sum to the city and thereafter refunds such sum to such person in whole or part, such operator may take the amount of such refund as a credit against future taxes only upon submitting to the finance director a statement under penalty of perjury specifying the reasons for the credit and providing proof of payment of such refund. 
(e)  Nothing contained in this article shall be deemed to authorize as a credit against taxes owed any amount returned by the operator to any tour promoter, travel agent, or third party other than the hotel visitors. Travel agent commissions are an expense of the operator and may not be deducted from the rent. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 6, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-130. - Registration. 
(a)  Within thirty (30) days after commencing business each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to hotel visitors shall register said hotel with the finance director and obtain from him a hotel visitors registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(1)  The name of the operator; 
(2)  The address of the hotel; 
(3)  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
(4)  The words: 
"This Hotel Visitors registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform Hotel Visitors tax ordinance by registering with the finance director for the purpose of collecting from Hotel Visitors the Hotel Visitors tax and remitting said tax to the finance director. The certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a Hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(b)  No hotel visitors registration certificate issued pursuant to this article shall be transferable or assignable; provided, that where a person holding a certificate issued under the provisions of this article changes the name of the business, such person shall upon changing the name make a written application to the finance director to have said certificate amended to reflect the change in name; and provided further, that transfer, whether by sale or otherwise, to another person under such circumstances that the real or ultimate ownership after the transfer is substantially similar to the ownership existing before the transfer shall not be prohibited by this section. For the purpose of this section stockholders, bondholders, partnerships, or other persons holding an interest in a corporation or other entity herein defined to be a person are regarded as having the real or ultimate ownership of such corporation or other entity. 
(c)  Whenever, upon the sale or transfer of an existing hotel, a hotel visitors registration certificate is applied for, the finance director shall require that the succeeding operator produce a certificate of nonliability or other receipt issued by the finance director establishing that no unsatisfied liability for hotel visitors taxes exists. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor to operate a hotel without a valid hotel visitors registration certificate or to fail to post the certificate issued in a conspicuous place at all times. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 7, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-131. - Reporting and remitting. 
All operators shall report and remit monthly the full amount of hotel visitors taxes collected for the previous month upon the appropriate approved form available from the finance director. Hotel visitors taxes shall be deemed to be collected at that time at which the rent is earned if the operator uses the accrual basis of accounting or the time at which rent is received if the operator uses the cash basis of accounting. The same basis of accounting used for keeping the books and records shall be used for reporting and remitting hotel visitors taxes. The finance director may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this article shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the finance director. 
(a)  Calendar month reporting period. Each operator reporting on a calendar month basis shall, on or before the last day of the following month, make a return to the finance director on approved forms of the total taxable rents charged and the full amount of hotel visitors taxes collected for the previous month. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the finance director. 
(b)  Timely returns. Returns and taxes remitted monthly and actually received by the finance director on or before the last day of the following month shall be deemed to be timely filed and remitted; otherwise, the taxes are delinquent and subject to the penalties imposed pursuant to section 35-132. Provided, however, that when the last day upon which a return may be filed and taxes remitted falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or city, state, or national holiday, a timely filing and remittance may be made upon the first following working day. Returns filed and taxes remitted by mail shall be deemed to be timely filed only if the envelope or similar container enclosing the returns and taxes is addressed to the finance director, has sufficient postage and bears a United States postmark or a postage meter imprint prior to midnight on the last day for reporting and remitting without a penalty, if the last day for reporting and remitting said tax falls on a weekend or holiday, a filing shall be deemed to be timely filed if mailed prior to midnight of the first following working day. If such envelope or other container bears a postage meter imprint as well as a United States Post Office cancellation mark, the latter shall govern in determining whether the filing and remittance are timely. 
(Ord. No. NS-1091, § 1, 8-16-71; Ord. No. NS-2162, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. NS-2648, § 8, 4-5-04)  
Sec. 35-132. - Penalties and interest; audit deficiency. 
(a)  Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this article within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
(b)  Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay an additional delinquency penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of sixty (60) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay an additional delinquency penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed together with the additional ten (10) percent penalty imposed. 
(c)  Audit deficiency. If, upon audit by the city, an operator is found to be deficient in either its return or its remittance or both, the finance director shall immediately assess the operator the amount of the net deficiency plus an audit deficiency penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the net deficiency. If said operator's remittance was deficient for a period of greater than thirty (30) days following the date on which remittance was first delinquent, said operator shall pay an additional audit deficiency penalty of ten (10) percent of the net deficiency and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed.

In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this article shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half (1½) percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

Sec. 35-133. - Failure to collect and report tax. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this article, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this article, the finance director shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the finance director shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this article and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this article. In case such determination is made, the finance director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the finance director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the finance director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the finance director shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the finance director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in section 35-134.

Sec. 35-139. - Security for collection of the tax. 
(a)  To ensure compliance with hotel visitors tax payment requirements, the finance director shall require each new operator subject to such requirements to deposit with the city within one (1) year after the effective date of this article, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, such security in a form acceptable to the finance director in the amount not greater than the person's estimated average liability for the first period for which a return must be filed or the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), whichever is the lesser. To recover hotel visitors taxes, including penalties and interest, remittable by the depositor, the finance director may apply the security deposited with the finance director. 
(b)  At least fifteen (15) days prior to the application of a security deposit, the finance director shall serve upon the depositing operator notice of intent to apply the security deposit. Service of notice may be made by placing the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the depositing operator at his hotel. Any portion of the security remaining after satisfaction of outstanding hotel visitors taxes, penalties, interest and costs of sale may be retained by the finance director for security or may be paid over by him to the depositing operator. 
(c)  In the case of the transfer or cessation of business by the depositor, the finance director shall refund or release the security amount required pursuant to this section, upon depositor's presentation to the finance director of either a receipt from the finance director showing that all hotel visitors taxes, including any penalty, interest or other charges or costs outstanding, have been paid or a certificate of nonliability stating the nonliability of the depositor for payment of hotel visitors tax as hereunder provided in section 35-140.

Sec. 35-140. - Transfer or cessation of business; operator's duty to notify; remitting and reporting requirements; closeout audit; successor's duty to notify; successor's liability; certificate of nonliability. 
(a)  Operator's duty to notify. An operator who is transferring, selling or terminating his business shall notify the finance director in writing of such sale, transfer or termination and the name and address of the purchaser or transferee at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date of the transfer, sale or termination, unless the decision to sell, transfer or terminate was made within less than a thirty-day period prior to the transfer, sale or termination, in which case the operator shall then immediately notify the purchaser or transferee of their responsibility for unpaid taxes as set forth in subsections (c) and (d) below, and further certify in writing to the finance director that the transferee or purchaser was notified of the requirements of this article regarding its responsibility for unpaid collected taxes. 
(b)  Remitting and reporting requirements. Each operator upon the transfer or cessation of business for any reason shall, on or before the last day of the next month following the transfer or cessation of business, make a return to the finance director on approved forms of the total taxable rents charged, the amount of tax collected for the reporting period, remittances made, if any, and the balance of the tax due, if any, shall be remitted to the finance director. 
(c)  Closeout audit. After filing the final return and remitting the balance due, the operator shall make his records of account available for a closeout audit by the finance director or duly authorized employee or agent of the city. If, upon audit by the city, the operator transferring or quitting his business is found to have satisfied all hotel visitors liability, the finance director shall issue to such operator a certificate of nonliability stating the nonliability of the operator for payment of hotel visitors taxes. If, upon audit by the city, the operator transferring or quitting his business is deficient in either his return or his remittance or both, the finance director shall immediately assess such operator the amount of the net deficiency in accordance with section 35-132 above. Upon such operator's remittance of the deficient amount plus any penalty and interest assessed, the finance director shall issue a certificate of nonliability. 
(d)  Successor's duty to notify. If an operator who is liable for any hotel visitors taxes, penalties or interest under this article sells or otherwise transfers his business, his assignee or successor in interest shall notify the finance director of the date of the sale or transfer at least thirty (30) days before the date of the sale or transfer. If the decision to sell or transfer was made within less than a thirty-day period prior to the sale or transfer, the assignee or successor in interest shall notify the finance director immediately and shall withhold an amount equal to the accrued or outstanding hotel visitors tax liability of the operator until the transferring operator produces either a receipt from the finance director showing that the tax, including any penalty, interest or other charge or cost outstanding, has been paid or a certificate of nonliability stating the nonliability of the operator for payment of hotel visitors tax. If the transferor does not present a receipt or notice of nonliability within thirty (30) days after such sale or transfer after such assignee or successor commences to conduct business, the assignee or successor shall deposit the withheld amount with the finance director pending settlement of the account of the transferor. 
(e)  Successor's liability. If the assignee or successor in interest fails to withhold the amount required to satisfy the tax liability, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him and shall be subject to penalty and interest charges as set forth in section 35-132. 
(f)  Certificate of nonliability. Within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the application of any operator for a certificate of nonliability for the payment of hotel visitors taxes, the finance director after conducting an audit therefore shall issue the certificate if the operator's tax liability has been satisfied to the date of the application. If tax has accrued to that date, the finance director shall give notice to the operator of the amount which must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate.

Sec. 35-141. - Additional powers and duties of tax administrator, etc. 
(a)  The finance director shall have the power and duty to enforce this article and shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this article for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of all such rules and regulations adopted by the finance director shall be maintained on file in the offices of the finance director. Where uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of any provision of this article or its application to a specific hotel, operator or hotel visitors, the finance director shall determine the intent of the provision. Such determination shall take the form of a written memorandum of intent. A copy of all such memoranda issued by the finance director shall be maintained on file in the offices of the finance director. 
(b)  The finance director shall have the further power, for good cause shown, to extend the time for filing any required report and remitting any taxes collected for thirty (30) days; and shall have the further power, for good cause shown, to waive or release any cash deposit, bond, bankshare, lien, or other security required and to compromise any claim as to any penalty imposed or charge demanded. 
(c)  The finance director may with the consent and approval of the city attorney enter into written agreements with persons liable for the payment of delinquent taxes, penalties and interest, in monthly installments, or more often, extending over a period not exceeding one (1) year. In any agreement so entered into, such person shall acknowledge the obligation owed the city and agree that, in the event of failure to make timely payment of any installment, the whole amount unpaid, principal together with interest, shall become immediately due and payable. In the event legal action is brought by the city to enforce collection of any amount included in the agreement, such person shall pay all costs of suit incurred by the city or its assignee, including attorney fees. The execution of such an agreement shall not prevent the prior accrual of penalties and interest on unpaid balances at the rate provided hereinabove, but no penalties or additional interest shall accrue as hereinafter provided on account of taxes included in the agreement after the execution of the agreement and the payment of the first installment and during such time as such operator shall not be in breach of the agreement. The execution of such an agreement shall render any subsequent appeal null and void and shall constitute a waiver against future action. 
(d)  In addition to all other authority conferred upon him, the finance director, upon the concurrence of the city attorney, shall have the authority to discontinue the collection of any claim if it appears that further proceedings would be without merit.

Sec. 35-154. - Constitutional exemptions. 
(a)  Nothing in this code shall be construed as imposing a tax upon: 
(1)  Any person or service when imposition of such tax upon that person or service would be in violation of a federal or state statute, the Constitution of the United States or that of the State of California; and 
(2)  The city. 
(b)  Any service user that is exempt from the taxes imposed by this code pursuant to subsection (a) shall file an application with the tax administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name, or is a service user of telephone communication services that has received a federal excise tax exemption certificate for such service. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the tax administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service providers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the tax administrator, such service user shall give the tax administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service providers so that the tax administrator can properly notify the new utility service provider of the service user's tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users taxes collected and remitted to the tax administrator from such service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the tax administrator, a service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users tax. With respect to a service user of telephone communication service, a service supplier of such telephone communication services doing business in the city shall, upon the request of the tax administrator, provide a copy of the federal exemption for each exempt customer within the city that is served by such service supplier. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-155. - Telephone users tax. 
(a)  There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the city using telecommunication services. The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of five and one-half (5½) percent of the charges made for such services and shall be collected from the service user by the telecommunication services supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that telecommunication services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part, within the city's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this section. There is also a rebuttable presumption that prepaid telecommunication services sold within the city are used, in whole or in part, within the city and are therefore subject to taxation under this section. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the telecommunication services. 
(b)  "Mobile telecommunications service" shall be sourced in accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Section 124). The tax administrator may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this article, sourcing rules for the taxation of other telecommunication services, including but not limited to post-paid telecommunication services, prepaid telecommunication services, VoIP, and private communication services, provided that such rules are based upon custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multi jurisdictional taxation (e.g., streamlined sales and use tax agreement). 
(c)  The tax administrator may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this article, an administrative ruling identifying those telecommunication services, or charges therefore, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection (a) above. 
(d)  To prevent actual multi jurisdictional taxation of telecommunication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under this section. 
(e)  The tax on telecommunication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the 20th day of the following month. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00; Ord. No. 2721, § 3, 8-7-06; Ord. No. NS-2723, § 3, 8-7-06; Ord. No. NS-2860, § 4, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-155.1. - Bundling taxable items. 
If any nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier's books and records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable and non-taxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges. 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 5, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-155.2. - Substantial nexus/minimum contact. 
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this article, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users' tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any telecommunication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under this article. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the city, directly or through an agent, affiliate, or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the city or distributed from a location with the city; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail; or if there are activities performed in the city on behalf of the service supplier that are significantly associated with the service supplier's ability to establish and maintain a market in the city for the provision of utility services that are subject to a tax under this article (e.g., an affiliated person engaging in activities in the city that inure to the benefit of the service supplier in its development or maintenance of a market for its services in the city). 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 6, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-156. - Electricity users tax. 
(a)  There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the City of Santa Ana using electricity in the city. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of six (6) percent of the charges made for such electricity, and for any supplemental services or other associated activities directly related to and/or necessary for the provision of electricity to the service user, which are provided by a service supplier or non-utility service supplier to a service user. The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items that are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of electric service; or, ii) historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges" shall include but is not limited to, the following charges: 
(1)  Energy charges; 
(2)  Distribution or transmission charges; 
(3)  Metering charges; 
(4)  Stand-by, reserves, firming, ramping, voltage support, regulation, emergency, or other similar minimum charges for services;

(6)  Charges, fees or surcharges for electricity services or programs, which are mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whether or not such charges, fees or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing. 
(c)  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall also include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the electricity or services related to the provision of such electricity. If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify charges not subject to the utility users tax based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(d)  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the electric service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of electrical retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such electric service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of electric service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Unbundled charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) above. 
(e)  As used in this section, the term "using electricity" shall not be construed to include the mere receiving of such electricity by an electric public utility or governmental agency at a point within the city for resale; or the use of such electricity in the production or distribution of water by a public utility or a governmental agency. 
(f)  The tax on electricity provided by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this code shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in section 35-158 of this code. All other taxes on charges for electricity imposed in this section shall be collected from the service user by the electric service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the tax administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month in accordance with section 35-163 of this code; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month in accordance with section 35-163 of this code.

The tax imposed by this section shall be at a rate of six (6) percent of the charges made for such gas, including all services related to the storage, transportation and delivery of such gas, and shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items for gas service that are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of gas service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges" shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges: 
(1)  The commodity charges for purchased gas, or the cost of gas owned by the service user (including the actual costs attributed to drilling, production, lifting, storage, gathering, trunkline, pipeline, and other operating costs associated with the production and delivery of such gas), which is delivered through a gas pipeline distribution system; 
(2)  Gas transportation charges (including interstate charges to the extent not included in commodity charges); 
(3)  Storage charges; provided, however, that the service provider shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service provider cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service provider and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction; and 
(4)  Capacity or demand charges, late charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, transition charges, customer charges, minimum charges, annual and monthly charges, and any other charges which are necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of gas service, and 
(5)  Charges, fees or surcharges for gas services or programs, which are mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whether or not such charges, fees or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.

If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify charges not subject to the utility users tax based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(d)  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the gas service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of gas retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such gas service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such gas service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of gas service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Unbundled charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) above. 
(e)  There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this section is computed: 
(1)  Charges made for gas which is to be resold and delivered through a pipeline distribution system; 
(2)  Charges made for gas sold for use in the generation of electricity or for the production or distribution of water by a public utility or governmental agency; and

(f)  The tax that is calculated on charges for gas provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this code shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in section 35-158 of this code. All other taxes imposed in this section shall be collected from the service user by the gas service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the tax administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month in accordance with section 35-163 of this code; or, at the option of the person required to collect or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month in accordance with section 35-163 of this code. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)

Sec. 35-158. - Collection of tax from service users receiving direct purchase of gas or electricity. 
(a)  Any service user subject to the tax imposed by section 35-156 or by section 35-157 of this Code, which produces gas or electricity for self-use, or which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this ordinance, or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service supplier, a non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, in the city, shall report said fact to the tax administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. 
(b)  The tax administrator may require said service user to identify its non-utility service supplier and provide, subject to audit, invoices, books of account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or, if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the tax administrator is excessive, the tax administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the primary provider of gas or electricity within the city. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the city.

(1)  Water commodity charges (potable and non-potable); 
(2)  Distribution or transmission charges; 
(3)  Metering charges;

If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the service supplier can reasonably identify charges not subject to the utility users tax based upon its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, which shall be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(d)  There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this section is computed charges made for water which is to be resold and delivered through a pipeline distribution system. 
(e)  The tax on water service imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or its billing agent.

Sec. 35-160. - Decisions on amounts imposed. 
If any tax, penalty, or interest charge imposed by this code is for any reason held to be discriminatory or invalid in amount, by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of a lesser amount imposed by the tax administrator with the concurrence of the city attorney. The city council hereby declares that it would have imposed a valid utility users tax, penalty, or interest charge of the maximum nondiscriminatory amount permitted by law, up to but not exceeding, the amount provided under this code on the person or persons in question, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more of the taxes, penalties, or interest charges imposed herein may be declared discriminatory or invalid in amount.

(d)  Whenever a service supplier negligently fails in its duty to determine and collect the required tax from a service user, any other amount collected by the service supplier from the service user shall then be subject to a constructive trust in the favor of the city for the full amount of the uncollected tax.

Sec. 35-162. - Duty to remitProcedures.

If taxes collected by a service supplier from a service user, or self collected by a service user subject to section 35-158 of this code are not remitted to the tax administrator on or before the due dates provided in this code, such taxes shall be delinquent. The tax administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies in remittance at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the total delinquent amount due. 
(b)  Taxes not collecteddelinquencies in collection. If a service supplier required to collect any tax hereunder fails to collect such tax, or, if a service user required to self-collect and remit the tax pursuant to section 35-158 of this code, fails to self collect the tax, the tax administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies in collection at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the total tax amount that is determined to be due.

(d)  Taxes not fully remitteddeficiencies in remittance. If a service supplier required to collect and remit any tax hereunder fails to remit the full amount of the tax collected, or, if a service user subject to section 35-158 of this code fails to properly remit the full amount of the tax self-collected, the tax administrator shall attach a penalty for such deficiencies in remittance at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the total tax amount that is determined to be due. 
(e)  Fraud or gross negligenceadditional penalties. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any delinquency or deficiency due by any service supplier, or service user required to self-collect and remit the tax pursuant to section 35-158 of this code, is due to fraud or gross negligence, the tax administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon such persons at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the amount of the remittance due. 
(f)  Penaltiesmaximum amount. The cumulative amount of all applicable penalties imposed under this code shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of the tax originally owed.

Sec. 35-165. - Actions to collect. 
Any tax, penalty, or interest required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this code shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user together with any penalties or interest due thereon which have not been remitted to the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the service supplier required to collect and remit. The amount of any tax required to be collected from a service user by a service supplier which is held in constructive trust in the favor of the city shall be a debt owed by the service supplier to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this code shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount plus related costs incurred by the city.

(a)  Service supplier or service userfailure to collect and/or remit tax. If any service supplier, or any service user subject to section 35-158 of this code, (hereinafter "service supplier" in this subsection) required to collect and/or remit the tax imposed by this code shall fail or refuse to collect said tax or to make, within the time provided in this code, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this code, the tax administrator shall make a determination of the tax due (tax, interest and penalties hereinafter "amount assessed" in this subsection). The tax administrator shall give a written notice of the amount assessed by personal service or by depositing it in the United States mail, addressed to the service supplier at the service supplier's last known address. The service supplier may, within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed in accordance with section 35-173 of this code. If application by the service supplier for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the amount assessed shall become final and immediately due and payable. 
(b)  Service userfailure to pay tax. Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him or her from the amounts remitted to a service supplier required to collect the tax, or that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax to such service supplier for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve such service supplier of the obligation to collect taxes due under this code from such service users for specified billing periods. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names, account numbers, billing and service addresses, and other required information of such non-paying service users together with the amounts owed under the provisions of this code and the specified billing periods for which they are owed. The tax administrator shall give written notice to the non-paying service user that he or she has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal service or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen (15) days from the date of the service of the notice, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than five dollars ($5.00), along with interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-168. - Records. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by this code to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the tax administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the tax administrator to establish compliance with this code, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. The tax administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the city attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to state Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7, as amended from time to time. 
(b)  The tax administrator may request from any person providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the city, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the city pursuant to section 6354(e) of the state Public Utilities Code, as amended from time to time. 
(c)  If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the tax administrator, or any designated agent of the tax administrator, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the tax administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on such person for each day following the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed by this code. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-169. - Refunds. 
(a)  Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this code, it may be refunded as provided in this section. No refund will be considered by the tax administrator for a period in excess of twelve (12) months prior to the date application is received. 
(b)  The tax administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this code, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor or administrator has submitted a written claim to the tax administrator within twelve (12) months of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. 
(c)  The submission of a written claim, which is acted upon by the city, shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon as provided in accordance with state Government Code Section 935, as amended from time to time. The city shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set forth in state Government Code Section 912.4, as amended from time to time. If the city fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by state Government Section 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the city on the last day of the period within which the city was required to act upon the claim as provided in state Government Code Section 912.4. 
(d)  Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the city within the three (3) years next preceding a notice of tax deficiency or assessment by the tax administrator, or during any year for which the service supplier, at the request of the tax administrator, has executed a waiver of the defense of the statute of limitations with regard to any claim the city may have for a utility users tax. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a service supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the 12-month written claim requirement of this section. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-170. - Low income household exemption. 
(a)  The utility users tax imposed by this code shall not apply to any service user who uses telephone, electric, gas or water services in or upon any premises occupied by such service user, provided the combined gross income of all members of the household in which such user resided was less than the low income household exemption level for the calendar year prior to the fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) for which the exemption provided in this section is applied for. The low income household exemption level shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
The exemption granted by this section shall not eliminate the duty of the service supplier to collect taxes from such exempt individual or the duty of such exempt individual to pay such taxes to the service supplier, unless an exemption is applied for by the service user and granted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) hereof. 
(b)  Any service user exempt from the taxes imposed by this code because of the provisions of subsection (a) above may file an application with the tax administrator for an exemption. Such application shall be made upon forms supplied by the tax administrator and shall recite facts under oath which qualify the applicant for an exemption. The tax administrator shall review all such applications and certify as exempt those applicants determined to qualify therefor notify all service suppliers affected that such exemption has been approved, stating the name of the applicant, the address to which such exempt service is being supplied, the account number, and such other information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt service user from its tax billing procedure. Upon receipt of such notice, the service supplier shall not be required to continue to bill any further tax imposed by this code from such exempt service user until further notice by the tax administrator is given. The service supplier shall eliminate such exempt service user from its tax billing procedure upon receipt of such notice from the tax administrator, no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice from the tax administrator. 
(c)  All exemptions shall be renewed annually by the exempt service user during the renewal period of April 1 through April 30. The tax administrator shall notify all service suppliers by May 31 of exempt service users who did not renew during the annual renewal period. Each service supplier shall include the service users specified in such notice in its tax billing procedure no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice from the tax administrator. Exemptions shall automatically terminate with any change in the service address or residence of the exempt individual; provided such individual may nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each change of address or residence. Any individual exempt from the tax shall notify the tax administrator within ten (10) days of any change in fact or circumstance which might disqualify said individual from receiving such exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of the exemptions provided by this section when the basis for such exemption either does not exist or ceases. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this subsection, however, any service supplier who determines by any means that a new or nonexempt service user is receiving service through a meter or connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or exempt user of the same meter or connection, such service supplier shall immediately notify the tax administrator of such fact and the tax administrator shall conduct an investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have been complied with and, where appropriate, order the service supplier to commence collecting the tax from the nonexempt service user. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-171. - Violation; misdemeanor; remediesCumulative. 
(a)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall upon conviction be punishable thereafter as provided in section 1-8 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code. 
(b)  The conviction and fine or imprisonment of any person for violation of this code shall not relieve such person from paying the utility users tax together with any penalty or interest amount due under the terms of this code, nor shall the payment of any utility users tax, or any penalty, or any interest amount due prevent a civil action or criminal prosecution for the violation of any of the provisions of this code. All remedies prescribed hereunder shall be cumulative and the use of one (1) or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions hereof. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-172. - Reserved. 
Editor's note Ord. No. NS-2860, § 10, adopted December 9, 2014, repealed § 35-172 in its entirety. Former § 35-172 pertained to maximum tax amount payable under the utility users tax, and was derived from Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, adopted August 4, 2000.  
Sec. 35-173. - Right to administrative hearing; appeals. 
(a)  If any service user or service supplier (hereinafter "applicant" in this subsection) is aggrieved by any decision, administrative assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator, or with the failure to grant a refund or exemption as provided for under this code, such applicant may appeal to the tax administrator in writing for an administrative hearing. If application by the applicant for an administrative hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the prior decision of the tax administrator shall become final. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give at least five (5) days' written notice scheduling a date, time and place for a hearing. Such notice shall be given through personal service or by depositing it in the United States mail, addressed to the applicant's last known address. The applicant may appear before the tax administrator and/or the tax administrator's authorized administrative hearing officer (hereinafter "hearing officer" in this subsection) and offer evidence appealing the tax administrator's decision. After such hearing the "hearing officer" shall make a determination and give written notice to the applicant regarding his or her determination. The determination of the "hearing officer" shall become final and shall render any subsequent appeal null and void and shall further act as a waiver against future action, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to Chapter 3 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code. 
(b)  A timely request for an administrative hearing and attendance is required in accordance with subsection (a) above shall be a prerequisite for an appeal made pursuant to Chapter 3 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code.

(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-175. - Saving clause. 
Neither the adoption of this code nor its superseding of any portion of any other code shall in any manner be construed to affect prosecution for violation of any chapter, article, code, or ordinance prior to the effective date hereof, nor be construed as a waiver of any tax or any penal provision applicable to any such violation, and all rights and obligations thereunto appertaining shall continue in full force and effect. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-176. - Severability. 
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this code or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision, and the decision not to enforce such, shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this code or any part thereof. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-177. - Notice of changes to utility users tax code. 
If a tax under this code is added, repealed, increased, reduced, or the tax base is changed, the tax administrator shall follow the notice requirements of state Public Utilities Code Section 799. Prior to the effective date of the code change, the service supplier shall provide the tax administrator with a copy of any written procedures describing the information that the service supplier needs to implement the code change. If the service provider fails to provide such written instructions, the tax administrator, or his or her agent, shall send, by first class mail, a copy of the code change to all collectors and remitters of the city's utility users taxes according to the latest payment records of the tax administrator. 
(Ord. No. NS-2436, § 2, 8-4-00)  
Sec. 35-178. - Effect of state and federal reference/authorization. 
Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal statute in this article shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time to time, provided that such reference to a statute herein shall not include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of law with the duty to interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment or change of interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease (as a result of excluding all or a part of a utility service, or charge therefor, from taxation). Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent. 
To the extent that the city's authorization to collect or impose any tax imposed under this article is expanded or limited as a result of changes in state or federal law, no amendment or modification of this article shall be required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to the full extent of the authorization up to the full amount of the tax imposed under this article. 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 11, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-179. - No increase in tax percentage or change in methodology without voter approval; amendment or repeal. 
This article of the Santa Ana Municipal Code may be repealed or amended by the city council without a vote of the people. However, as required by Chapter XIIIC of the California Constitution, voter approval is required for any amendment provision that would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant to this article. The people of the City of Santa Ana affirm that the following actions shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a tax: 
(1)  The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher than that set by this article, if the city council has acted to reduce the rate of the tax; 
(2)  An administrative or legislative action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax, or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as such interpretation or clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the language of this article; 
(3)  The establishment a class of persons or class of service that is exempt or excepted from the tax or the discontinuation of any such exemption or exception (other than the discontinuation of an exemption or exception specifically set forth in this article); or 
(4)  The collection of the tax imposed by this article, even if the city had, for some period of time, failed to collect the tax. 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 12, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-180. - Remedies cumulative.

The use of one (1) or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article. 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 13, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-181. - Interaction with prior tax. 
(a)  Collection of tax by service providers. Service providers shall begin to collect the tax imposed by this amended article as soon as feasible after the effective date of this article, but in no event later than permitted by Section 799 of the California Public Utilities Code. 
(b)  Satisfaction of tax obligation by service users. Prior to April 1, 2015, any person who pays the tax levied pursuant to this article, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, with respect to any charge for a service shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to this article as amended herein, with respect to that charge. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during the transition period from the prior Utility Users' Tax Code to the amended Utility Users' Tax Ordinance (which transition period ends April 1, 2015) and to permit service providers or other persons with an obligation to remit the tax hereunder, during that transition period, to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax. 
(c)  Satisfaction of tax obligation by service users paying the prior maximum utility users tax. Prior to July 1, 2015, any person who pays the maximum tax amount payable under the utility users tax pursuant to this article, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to this article as amended herein for the period of July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. 
(d)  In the event that a final court order should determine that the election enacting this article (as amended herein) is invalid for whatever reason, or that any tax imposed under this article (as amended herein) is invalid in whole or in part, then the taxes imposed under this article, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, shall automatically continue to apply with respect to any service for which the tax levied pursuant to this article has been determined to be invalid. Such automatic continuation shall be effective beginning as of the first date of service (or billing date) for which the tax imposed by this article is not valid. However, in the event of an invalidation, any tax (other than a tax that is ordered refunded by the court or is otherwise refunded by the city) paid by a person with respect to a service and calculated pursuant to this article (as amended herein) shall be deemed to satisfy the tax imposed under this article, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, on that service, so long as the tax is paid with respect to a service provided no later than six (6) months subsequent to the date on which the final court order is published. 
( Ord. No. NS-2860, § 14, 12-9-14 )  
Sec. 35-182. - Ratification of prior tax.

(2)  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
(3)  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes. 
(4)  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax that can be administered in a manner that will, to the greatest degree possible, be consistent with the provisions of Parts 1.6 of Division 2 of the said Revenue and Taxation Code, and thereby minimize the cost of collecting city transactions and use taxes, and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon person's subject to taxation under the provisions thereof.

Sec. 36-600. - Findings. 
The city council of the city hereby finds and determines that: 
(a)  State law establishing requirements for development of a county wide congestion management program (AB 1791) mandates the inclusion of a trip reduction and travel demand management ordinance. 
(b)  Other transportation demand management (TDM) program requirements have been adopted for the region including South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 2202, as amended, and Appendix IV-E Control Measures of the 1991 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). 
(c)  The growth management plan included in the revised traffic improvement and growth management ordinance (Measure M) requires jurisdictions to promote alternative forms of transportation and overall transportation system efficiency by maximizing use of the existing transportation network through transportation system management (TSM) and transportation demand management (TDM) and calls for the adoption of a TSM ordinance or alternative mitigation to reduce single occupancy automobile travel. 
(d)  Increased traffic congestion contributes to longer travel times, deterioration in air quality, and inefficient use of the existing transportation system. 
(e)  The congestion management program (CMP) recognizes and encourages the use of transportation demand management (TDM) strategies to promote alternative transportation methods and improve the general efficiency of the transportation system by enhancing vehicle flow and shifting demand on existing transportation facilities through encouraging changes in individual travel behavior. 
(f)  Implementation of TDM strategies at the local government level would provide public benefits by improving air quality and enhancing the effectiveness of the existing transportation system. 
(g)  Coordinated TDM efforts among all local jurisdictions in the county can contribute to improvements in air quality and the efficiency and effectiveness of the transportation system including reductions in traffic congestion. 
(h)  This article serves to codify standards of transportation demand management and transportation system management which, prior to its adoption, were imposed on development projects as conditions of approval through the city's environmental review process.

The TDM program is recorded with the project covenants, conditions and restrictions to assure perpetual operation of the plan regardless of changes in project ownership. 
TDM strategy plan means the plan, consisting of operational programs and strategies, prepared by all development project applicants and submitted to the city, whether or not a trip reduction credit is granted. 
Transportation demand management (TDM) means programs, plans, policies or projects designed to reduce demand on the transportation system or maximize its efficient use. TDM can include, but is not limited to, an emphasis on alternative travel modes to the single occupant vehicle such as carpools, vanpools and transit; reduction or elimination of the number of vehicle trips; shifts in the time of vehicle commutes to other than the peak period; or programs and projects to increase capacity on the transportation system. 
Transportation system management (TSM) means programs and projects to increase the capacity of the existing transportation system. TSM can include, but is not limited to, an emphasis on maximizing the use of the existing transportation system through strategies such as signal coordination, bus turnouts, channelization, one-way street systems, and barrier systems.

Sec. 39-5. - Private water and sewer lines. 
(a)  Water distribution lines and sewer collection lines constructed in private streets or in local streets not meeting the design criteria established by the director of public works shall be designated as private lines. It is the sole responsibility of the owner to operate and maintain the private water distribution lines, including without limitation all routine and emergency repairs, operation, and upkeep of all above ground appurtenances and underground valves, fittings, pipes, and service connections up to and including the meter curb stop. It is the sole responsibility of the owner to operate and maintain the private sewer collection lines, including without limitation all routine and emergency repairs, operation, and upkeep of sewer manholes and sewerage lift pumps.

Private water lines not constructed in conformance with these standards will be declared unapproved water systems requiring a higher degree of protection against cross-connection. Looped water lines must be protected against backflow at each connection to the city's public water system. 
(c)  Any modifications to private lines and their appurtenances shall be performed in accordance with the city's standard plans and the California Waterworks Standards. This includes without limitation the renewal, addition, or removal of service connections. All work must be permitted by the public works agency and the planning and building agency. Private water lines with non-conforming modifications will be declared unapproved water systems requiring a higher degree of protection against cross-connection than a reduced pressure principle assembly. Upon completion of the project, and prior to gaining occupancy permits to any of the units served with water and sewer, as-built plans stamped by an engineer licensed by the state must be submitted and approved by the public works agency. 
(d)  The city shall require the installation of a water meter in accordance with section 39-23(b) on every service connection to each dwelling unit, irrigation system, common area amenity, and individual commercial unit tapped from the private water line. The city will be responsible for the maintenance of the water meters, including meter reading, meter testing, meter repair, and replacement. To maintain, inspect, test, and read the public water meters, both an access easement to the development and a maintenance easement, confined to the water service meter box, shall be granted to the city by the private property served.

Sec. 41-258. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this division is to regulate the development of land for multiple-family residential purposes in the city. It is the intent of this division to set forth standards for the development of superior quality multiple-family housing development in a setting which is sensitive to the impacts on adjacent properties. It is further the intent of this division to create housing development which will be of such utility and function that it will remain liveable and usable for an extended period of years. It is also the intent of this division to provide functional and nonmonotonous orientation of buildings with a maximum of usable open space around each. 
(Ord. No. NS-2111, § 29, 4-1-91)  
Sec. 41-258.5. - Scope. 
This division applies to developments which are used solely for residential purposes and uses incidental thereto and which include one (1) or more multifamily dwellings. It does not apply to buildings which are used partly for dwelling units and partly for commercial or office uses (other than sales or management activities pertaining to dwelling units on the same site). It does apply to single-family and two-family dwellings which are part of a development which includes multiple-family dwellings. One-family dwellings that are not part of a development which includes multiple-family dwellings shall be subject to the design and development standards set forth in Division 3 of this article. Two-family dwellings that are not part of a development which includes multiple-family dwellings shall be subject to the design and development standards set forth in Division 4 of this article. Townhouses are subject to the standards set forth in Division 6 of this article instead of those set forth in this division. Nonresidential uses shall be subject to the design and development standards set forth in Division 12 of this article.

Sec. 41-588. - Applicability of division. 
PRD (planned residential development) suffixes are specifically subject to the regulations contained in this division. 
(Ord. No. NS-1112, § 1, 4-3-72)  
Sec. 41-589. - Description and purposes. 
The RE (residential-estate), R1 (single-family residence), R2 (multiple-family residence), R3 (medium-density multiple-family residence), R3H (high-density multiple-family residence), R4 (suburban apartment), CR (commercial-residential), and P (professional) Districts may be modified at the time the zoning is first established or by amendment by adding to the district designation "PRD." The intent and purpose of the Planned Residential Development District is to allow a development planned and designed as a unit to produce an environment of stable, desirable character not out of harmony with its surrounding neighborhood and which meets standards of density, open space, light and air, pedestrian and vehicular access, and traffic circulation no greater than the regulations to which the "PRD" suffix is combined. 
(Ord. No. NS-1112, § 1, 4-3-72)  
Sec. 41-590. - Conditional use permit required.

Sec. 41-591. - Development standards. 
Due to the complexity of planned residential developments, it is illogical and impractical to define herein an exact pattern for the arrangement of group dwellings for a parcel involving two (2) or more main dwellings; however, it is the intent of this district to provide a functional and nonmonotonous orientation of buildings with a maximum of open space around each main building consisting of courts, parkways, and patio areas, all oriented so as to provide separation of vehicular traffic from play areas and recreational area[s] for children and adults. 
Further, in order to more clearly define the intent of this district, there shall be on file in the office of the planning department illustrations entitled "Guides to Planned Residential Development." Said illustrations shall be approved by resolution by the planning commission and city council and shall show the desirable arrangement of buildings and open space, but are not designs which must be copied in order to secure approval of development plans as required by the provisions of the Planned Residential Development District. The following contemporary site design standards of principles are designed to provide assistance to the applicant: 
(a)  The overall plan shall be comprehensive, embracing land, buildings, landscaping and their interrelationships and shall conform in all respects to all adopted plans of all governmental agencies for the area in which the proposed development is located. 
(b)  The plan shall provide for adequate open space, circulation, off-street parking and pertinent amenities. Buildings, structures and facilities in the parcel shall be well integrated, oriented and related to the landscape features of the site. 
(c)  The proposed development shall be compatible with the general plan of land used and with circulation patterns on adjoining properties. It shall not constitute a disruptive element to the neighborhood and community. 
(d)  The internal street system shall not be a dominant feature in the overall design, rather it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function of any common areas and facilities. 
(e)  Common areas and recreational facilities shall be located so as to be readily accessible to the occupants of the dwelling units and shall be well related to any common open space provided. 
(f)  Architectural harmony within the development and within the neighborhood and community shall be obtained so far as is practicable. 
(g)  The number of dwelling units shall be as indicated by the base district. 
(h)  No more than fifty (50) per cent of the total lot area shall be devoted to main and accessory building area, driveways, open or enclosed parking areas and covered patios. The remaining fifty (50) per cent of the total lot area shall be devoted to landscaping; lawn area; noncommercial outdoor recreational facilities incidental to the residential developments such as private swimming pools; putting greens and tennis courts; walkways; uncovered patio areas; fences; and necessary fire-fighting equipment and installations. Further, the open space required by this section shall be arranged and provided in such a manner that it is accessible and usable for the purpose intended herein. Said open space shall not be devoted to commercial agricultural pursuits or any other activity in conflict with the stated purpose of this section and district. 
(i)  Only television and radio antennas which are located indoors or which are designed to serve all the occupants of the development shall be permitted. 
(j)  All usable open space not occupied by recreational facilities shall be densely landscaped and provided with a permanent underground irrigation system. 
(k)  All streets, alleys, walkways, and parking areas within the development which are not dedicated to public use shall be improved in accordance with improvement standards established by the department of public works and to widths as determined by section 34-165 relating to private street standards for planned residential development. Provisions acceptable to the city shall be made for the preservation and maintenance of all such streets, alleys, walkways and parking areas. All streets within a planned residential development shall provide adequate vehicular circulation for the development and for the area in which it is located. The vehicular circulation and the pedestrian circulation within a planned residential development shall be separated. A partial waiver of this requirement may be granted by the planning commission if it is determined that such partial waiver will not be inconsistent with adequate standards of pedestrian and vehicular circulation for the development and for the area in which it is located. 
(l)  The maximum building height and number of stories permitted shall not exceed the building height and number of stories permitted in the base district. However, the planning commission shall have the right to limit the number of stories in any or all of the buildings in a planned development, the base district regulations notwithstanding, when it finds that existing or proposed developments on adjacent properties, or properties across a street or alley, would be adversely affected unless such a limitation were imposed. 
(m)  Off-street parking shall be provided for each such development in compliance with section 41-617(b) and with the following additional requirements: 
(1)  A one-vehicle garage shall be provided for each bachelor or one-bedroom unit. A two-vehicle garage shall be provided for each dwelling unit having two (2) or more bedrooms.

The following modifications in yard regulations may be undertaken: 
(a)  Since the general yard provisions of this chapter have to be applied to numerous types of conditions and shapes of parcels occasioned by varying street layouts and subdivisions of property, it is not advisable to attempt to define herein those cases which warrant exceptions and modifications to the general yard requirements of this chapter, therefore, authority is hereby given the zoning administrator, as a part of his administrative function, to determine in writing the application of the specific requirements of this chapter in harmony with their purpose and intent so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public peace, health, safety, and welfare secured, and substantial justice done under the following circumstances: 
Where the application of yard regulations cannot be determined or may be interpreted in more than one way as to cause confusion in the administration of such regulations or general yard provisions with respect to irregularly shaped lots such as those resulting from some angular or curved streets, particularly triangular or irregular shaped lots with more than four (4) lot lines, or reverse corner lots developed in such a manner where the front yard is unclear such regulations or provisions may be modified or interpreted by the zoning administrator in writing as to an individual lot or to all lots of similar type involving a common problem and the building shall be governed by such interpretation. No fence or accessory building, the location of which is determined in whole or in part by yards, shall be erected or established upon any lot which is so irregularly or oddly shaped as to cause confusion relative to interpretation of such regulations until the yard provisions of this chapter shall have been determined as set forth above. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  The zoning administrator may, as a part of his administrative function, authorize a ten (10) per cent reduction in required side, front, and/or rear yard provided said determination shall be in writing and show that the reduction is in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(d)  The zoning administrator may, as part of his administrative function, authorize a temporary directional sign in permitted districts if said sign complies with all planning department standards set out below. Said authorization shall be in writing with the following conditions of approval: 
(1)  That the proposed temporary directional sign be not larger than ten feet by twenty feet (10' by 20'); said sign shall be nonilluminated in any residential or professional district, and non-flashing in any commercial or industrial district. 
(2)  That the sign be not more than thirty-five (35) feet in overall height from the ground. 
(3)  That the sign not be located on or project into any existing or future city right-of-way or any building setback. 
(4)  That the zoning administrator may grant a six (6) month extension of time at the expiration date of the initial six (6) month period if it has been determined that said extension of time is necessary for the initial sale of homes in the tract. Said extension shall require a five dollar ($5.00) fee. 
(5)  That the applicant post a cash bond in the amount determined by the director of building safety and housing to guarantee the removal of each sign at the expiration of the period of the conditional use permit, and that the applicant and/or the owner of the property on which the sign is located enter into an agreement with the city authorizing the city to enter upon the premises, destroy the sign, and declare the cash bond forfeited should said sign not be removed upon the expiration of the conditional use permit. 
However, the planning director may determine to circulate public notice and hold a public hearing when a proposed temporary directional sign is so located as to be of importance to the adjoining property owners or be in conflict with the orderly development of the area. 
The requirement of a plot plan, cash bond, and legal agreement shall be fulfilled prior to planning department approval of a building permit.

ARTICLE XII. - OFF-PREMISE COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING SIGNS  
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 41-1100. - Findings. 
The city council finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  Excessive commercial advertising signage within the city creates an unsightly appearance and has a blighting influence which is detrimental to the economic base of the city and to property values within the city. 
(2)  Excessive distracting signage increases the hazards to motorists and pedestrians on the public right-of-way. 
(3)  Commercial signs which identify or advertise goods, services or businesses which are sold or provided on the premises on which the sign is located serve a public purpose in assisting the public to locate desired goods, services or businesses and are a necessary incidental use of business property, whereas off-premise commercial advertising is a business in itself which does not serve that public interest. Therefore, off-premise commercial advertising signs may be legitimately and reasonably subjected to different and more restrictive regulations than on-premise commercial advertising signs. 
(4)  Billboards are installed and maintained primarily for the purpose of carrying commercial advertisements and may be legitimately and reasonably regulated as off-premise commercial advertising signs unless devoted exclusively to carrying noncommercial advertisements. 
(5)  Commercial advertising signs are not compatible with areas devoted primarily to residential uses. 
(6)  The city has adopted a general plan, five (5) redevelopment plans, and statements of goals and objectives which demonstrate a serious and comprehensive effort to promote the economic development of its commercial and industrial areas. A major part of this effort is concerned with the removal, limitation, or mitigation of those factors which contribute to an unattractive environment in the commercial and industrial areas, one of which is the presence of off-premise commercial advertising signs. Areas having special importance to the economic development of the city can be generally identified by reference to the general plan and the redevelopment plans. 
(Ord. No. NS-1722, § 1, 4-16-84)  
Sec. 41-1101. - Purposes. 
The purposes of this article are as follows: 
(1)  To preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place to live, work, trade, do business and visit; protect the city from the blighting influence of excessive off-premise commercial advertising signage; and thereby preserve and enhance the economic base of the city and safeguard property values within the city. 
(2)  To restrict off-premise commercial advertising signs so as to avoid increasing the hazards to motorists and pedestrians caused by excessive distracting signage. 
(3)  To precisely identify areas where the installation of additional off-premise commercial advertising signs should be prohibited due to the importance of such areas to the environmental and economic development goals and objectives of the city. 
(4)  To promote the relocation of existing off-premise commercial advertising signs to sites having less adverse effect on the city's goals and objectives, in accordance with Section 5412 of the Business and Professions Code of the State of California. 
(5)  To preclude off-premise commercial advertising signs in the residential areas of the city.

The "critical development areas" shall be designated and delineated as those areas of the city deemed to have paramount importance to the future economic growth and stability of the city. 
The "improvement areas" shall be designated and delineated as those areas which are characterized by a heavy concentration of off-premise commercial advertising signs and which have a secondary importance to the future economic growth and stability of the city.

(b)  Commercial advertisement means any advertisement which has, as its primary purpose, the promotion of the sale of goods or services by a commercial business or enterprise to the public generally or any significant part thereof. 
(c)  Noncommercial advertisement means any advertisement other than a commercial advertisement. 
(d)  On-premise advertisement means any commercial advertisement which pertains solely to goods or services which are produced or offered for sale on the premises where the advertisement is displayed.

Sec. 41-1309. - Interpretation of standards. 
In interpreting the parking standards set forth in this article, the following rules shall govern: 
(1)  Wherever required off-street parking is based upon gross floor area, the number of required spaces shall be determined by applying the appropriate mathematical ratio. If the product is not a whole number, the number of required spaces shall be the next lower natural number if the decimal fraction is less than five-tenths (0.5) or the next higher natural number if the decimal fraction is five-tenths (0.5) or more. Wherever required off-street parking is based upon some other factor, the number of required spaces shall be determined by the same arithmetical process. 
(2)  Wherever two (2) or more uses identified in this article exist on the same site or within the same building: 
a.  The number of parking spaces required for each use shall be determined separately. 
b.  Except as provided in sections 41-1390 and 41-1391, ancillary activities or uses within a single tenant space not exceeding fifteen (15) percent of the gross floor area shall be calculated at the parking ratio of the primary use. 
(3)  Wherever a particular use of property can be classified under more than one (1) section of this article which sets minimum parking space requirements, the section which contains the more specific use description shall apply. If two (2) or more equally specific sections apply, the section imposing the higher standard shall apply. 
(4)  Wherever required parking is based upon the number of seats in an area, eighteen (18) inches of bench space shall be deemed the equivalent of one (1) seat. 
(5)  Reduction in parking due to disabilities upgrade may be granted. When required solely as a need to upgrade existing parking facilities to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title III and California Code of Regulations (CCR), California Access Code, Title 24, may be reduced at the discretion of the planning manager. 
(6)  Additions of floor area up to twenty-five (25) percent of a designated historic resource on the Santa Ana Register of Historic Properties shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection. Additional parking shall be provided only for the floor area being added which exceeds a twenty-five (25) percent increase.

The occupancy of any tenant space of less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in all zones, may be interchanged among the below land uses without the need to provide additional parking beyond that currently provided on-site or in covenanted off-site spaces. The prior use must have been established with a valid business license and certificate of occupancy. Required parking shall be determined by the last occupancy that did not use this subsection in a space under two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in all zones. Parking will be determined by section 41-1300.

Sec. 41-1310. - In-lieu parking fee districts. 
(a)  The city council may, by resolution, establish one (1) or more in-lieu parking fee districts whereby property owners within any such district may receive a credit toward the number of off-street parking spaces otherwise required by this article by the payment of an in-lieu parking fee to be used by the city for the future provision of public parking facilities serving the district. 
(b)  Eligibility for the reception of an off-street parking credit shall be limited to: (1) the use and occupancy of existing buildings which lack sufficient parking spaces on site to satisfy the requirements of this article and which no longer have such status as a nonconforming use or nonconforming building which would allow them to be used and occupied without the provision of such parking; and (2) the intensification of use in an existing building. Such eligibility shall not extend to new building construction, nor to additions to existing buildings or the reconstruction of existing buildings even if such reconstruction does not increase existing or previous occupant load. 
(c)  Any resolution of the city council establishing an in-lieu parking fee district shall set forth the fee to be charged for each parking space for which an off-street parking credit shall be granted to an owner of eligible property within the district. Such resolution may also set forth such provisions as the council may determine appropriate for payment of the fee in installments over a period of years. The responsibility for such installment payments shall run with the ownership of the property. 
(d)  All revenues received by the city from the payment of in-lieu parking fees from owners of property within an in-lieu parking district shall be maintained in an account separate and apart from other city funds. Moneys in such account may be expended solely for the purpose of providing additional public parking in the district. 
(e)  No owner of property within an in-lieu parking fee district may receive any off-street parking credit pursuant to this section except pursuant to a parking plan approved for that property by the executive director of the community development agency of the city or his or her designated representative. The parking plan shall specify the number of parking spaces required to be provided on the property and the number of parking spaces for which off-street parking credits are granted. 
(f)  A parking plan may be revoked by the executive director of the community development agency of the city or his or her designated representative for failure by the owner of that property to pay installment payments on the in-lieu parking fee due for that property, and shall be reinstated upon the payment of all installments due. During such time as a parking plan is revoked: (1) the property shall not be credited with off-street parking credits for purposes of determining its compliance with the off-street parking requirements of this chapter; and (2) no further certificates of occupancy shall be issued for the property under the building code of the city.

" Evapotranspiration adjustment factor " or " ETAF " means a factor of 0.7, that when applied to reference evapotranspiration , adjusts for plant factors and irrigation efficiency , two major influences upon the amount of water that needs to be applied to the landscape. A combined plant mix with a site-wide average of 0.5 is the basis of the plant factor portion of this calculation. For purposes of the ETAF, the average irrigation efficiency is 0.71, therefore, the ET adjustment factor is (0.7)=(0.5/0.71). ETAF for a Special Landscape Area shall not exceed 1.0. ETAF for existing non-rehabilitated landscapes is 0.8. 
" Guidelines " refers to the guidelines for Implementation of this Article, as adopted by the City, which describes procedures, calculations, and requirements for landscape projects subject to this Article. The Guidelines are consistent with the regional Orange County Model Ordinance and Guidelines. 
" Landscaped area " means all the planting areas, turf areas, and water features in a landscape design plan subject to the Maximum Applied Water Allowance and Estimated Applied Water Use calculations. The landscaped area does not include footprints of buildings or structures, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, decks, patios, gravel or stone walks, other pervious or non-pervious hardscapes , and other non-irrigated areas designated for non-development (e.g., open spaces and existing native vegetation). 
" Landscape Documentation Package " means the package of documents that a project applicant is required to submit pursuant to section 2.1 of the Guidelines . 
" Landscape Installation Certificate of Completion " means the certificate included as exhibit E of the Guidelines that must be submitted to the City pursuant to section 2.7(C) thereof. 
" Landscape project " means total area of landscape in a project, as provided in the definition of " landscaped area ," meeting the requirements under Section 41-1501 of this Code. 
" Maximum Applied Water Allowance " or " MAWA " means the upper limit of annual applied water for the established landscaped area as specified in section 2.2 of the Guidelines . It is based upon the area's reference evapotranspiration , the ETAF , and the size of the landscaped area. The Estimated Applied Water Use shall not exceed the Maximum Applied Water Allowance . 
" Mined-land reclamation projects " means any surface mining operation with a reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. 
" New construction " means, for the purposes of this Article, a new building with a landscape or other new landscape such as a park, playground, or greenbelt without an associated building. 
" Permit " means an authorizing document issued by local agencies for new construction or rehabilitated landscape . 
" Rehabilitated landscape " means any re-landscaping project that requires a permit, plan check, or development review and meets the applicability criteria of the Guidelines where the modified landscape area is greater than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet. 
" Synthetic Turf " means an acceptable no mow ground cover made of synthetic, non-living material which meets the criteria standards set forth in the City's Design and Development Standards .

ARTICLE XVI.I - DENSITY BONUS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING[20] 

Footnotes: 
--- (20) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. NS-2485, adopted December 17, 2001, enacted provisions intended for use as article XVI, §§ 41-160041-1607. Inasmuch as there are already provisions so designated, and at the direction of the city, said provisions have been redesignated as article XVI.I, §§ 41-160041-1607. 
 
Sec. 41-1600. - Purpose of density bonus for affordable housing. 
The purpose of this article is to implement the mandatory provisions of California Government Code sections 65915 through 65918, as it may be amended from time to time (the "state density bonus law"), and to provide increased residential densities to developers who guarantee that a portion of their residential development will be available to low income, very low-income, or senior (also known as "qualified") households. The state density bonus law requires cities to adopt code provisions to specify the method by which the city will consider requests from housing developers seeking a density bonus for affordable or senior housing. The regulations are intended to materially assist the housing industry in providing adequate and affordable shelter for all economic segments of the community and to provide a balance of housing opportunities for low income, very low-income, and senior households throughout the city. It is intended that the affordable housing density bonus and any additional development incentive be available for use in all residential developments. It is intended that this article be interpreted in a manner that accommodates the provisions of the state density bonus law, and that, unless otherwise indicated, definitions found in the state density bonus law shall apply to this article. 
(Ord. No. NS-2485, § 3, 12-17-01)  
Sec. 41-1601. - When density bonus for affordable housing regulations applies. 
(a)  This article applies to any residential development of five or more dwelling units where an applicant proposes density beyond that permitted by the applicable designation of the general plan land use element in exchange for a portion of the total dwelling units in the development being reserved for low or very low-income households or for senior citizens or qualified residents through a written agreement. 
(b)  An applicant proposing development as provided in section 41-1601(a) shall be granted a density bonus as provided in sections 41-1602 and 41-1603 and may be granted an additional development incentive as provided in section 41-1604. 
(Ord. No. NS-2485, § 3, 12-17-01)  
Sec. 41-1602. - Density bonus for affordable housing agreement. 
(a)  An applicant shall be granted a density bonus for any residential development for which an agreement is entered into by the applicant and the city as provided in this section. 
(b)  An applicant seeking the grant of a density bonus shall, prior to submitting to the city an application for the proposed development project, submit a detailed, written preliminary proposal to the city's housing manager. Pursuant to section 65915(e) of the state density bonus law, if the applicant proposes a waiver or modification of the city's development standards, the applicant shall include sufficient, detailed information in its proposal to meet its burden to show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. 
(1)  The city's housing manager shall within ninety (90) days of receipt of a written proposal, notify the housing developer in writing of the procedures under which the city will comply with this article as provided for in section 65915(d) of the state density bonus law.

(3)  A Maintenance Agreement shall be formed, composed of and executed by all property owners, to maintain all common areas and appurtenances such as trees, landscaping, water treatment facilities, trash, parking, driveways, drive aisles, walkways, private water lines, meters, etc. Each owner and future property owners shall automatically become members of the agreement and shall be subject to a proportionate share of the maintenance and related costs. The Maintenance Agreement shall be recorded as a Covenant and Agreement to run with the land. The subdivider shall submit a copy of this Agreement, once recorded, to the Planning Division for placement in the tract file.
