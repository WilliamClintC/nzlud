PREFACE 
    The Franklin, Indiana, Municipal Code has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 2.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 2.12 of title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 5, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2017-11, passed January 8, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 5, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 5, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Chapter 1.16 - GENERAL PENALTY 
Sections: 

1.16.010 - General penalty-Enforcement of ordinances-Collection of monetary fines. 
A.  These provisions relative to the enforcement of ordinances involving the imposition of monetary fines for violations establishes the procedure by which the city will seek the collection of the monetary fines so imposed. The use of these procedures for collecting fines may be used separately or in conjunction with other legal remedies available to the city, such as the pursuit of injunctive relief. 
B.  The city officer, employee or other representative, charged with the duty and authority to issue citations for alleged violations of applicable city ordinances, rules and regulations, that involve, in whole or in part, the imposition of monetary fines (referred to hereafter as the "citing officer"), will as soon as practicable after the issuance of the citation, provide on a form prescribed by the clerk-treasurer the name and address of the person so cited, as well as other relevant information, such as date of citation, the amount of the fine as imposed by ordinance and a brief description of the violation. In those cases where the condition that prompted the citation continues unabated from day-to-day, the citing officer will issue the citation for each day of the continuing violation and will report each such citation to the clerk-treasurer as a separate violation. The citing officer's department head and the clerk-treasurer may use their sound discretion to administer this transfer of information from the citing officer to the clerk-treasurer. 
C.  The clerk-treasurer will maintain a record of citations forwarded to him or her from citing officers and collect from the persons so cited voluntary payments made by them of the fines associated with their violations. The clerk-treasurer is authorized to track and administer the payment and nonpayment of violations as he or she deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, employing the use of case management tools or other relevant tracking software and/or seeking the assistance of other city departments, including the police department and/or planning department (with their administrative capabilities) and/or Franklin city court (and its fines/payments capabilities). 
D.  Persons who fail to pay all of the fines imposed upon them within thirty (30) days of the citation being issued will be included in a list of unpaid citations (referred to hereafter as the "list") compiled by the clerk-treasurer and presented to the board of works as soon as practicable and routinely during the board of works' first meeting of each month. 
E.  The board of works will review the list, make any changes to the list that are warranted under the circumstances and forward the list, as revised, if at all, to the city attorney for enforcement. 
F.  The city attorney is authorized to take those measures reasonably necessary to prosecute and collect from those persons included on the list the fines imposed for such violations, as well as reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the action. Additionally, the city attorney may seek all other relief for the city that is available, including where appropriate and permitted by law, injunctive relief, imposition of pre-judgment attachments and foreclosure of post-judgment liens and restrictions of the person's driving privileges. The city attorney is authorized to enlist the assistance of the Johnson County prosecutor's office, attorneys representing individual city departments and/or other attorneys when such additional enforcement assistance furthers the efficiency and efficacy of the city's enforcement actions. In such cases, the Johnson County prosecutor's office and/or the other attorneys enlisted by the city attorney will work in conjunction with the city attorney to avail the city of all available enforcement remedies. The city attorney will provide the board of works with a periodic report of enforcement activity. 
G.

(Ord. 09-04, § 11) 
Exhibit "A" 
A.  The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that: 
1.  Secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; 
2.  Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; 
3.  Exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; 
4.  There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; 
5.  Establishing smoke-free workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air-cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and 
6.  Evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smoke-free policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. 
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006) 
B.  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately fifty-three thousand (53,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999) 
C.  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005) 
D.  Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in younger, pre-menopausal women; heart disease; and death. (Appendix II Findings of the Scientific Review Panel: Findings of the Scientific Review Panel on Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant as adopted at the Panel's June 24, 2005 Meeting," California Air Resources Board (ARB), September 12, 2005) 
E.  Scientific evidence has firmly established that there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, a pollutant that causes serious illness in adults and children. There is also indisputable evidence that implementing one hundred (100) percent smoke-free environments is the only effective way to protect the population from the harmful effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. (World Health Organization (WHO), "Protection from exposure to secondhand smoke: policy recommendations," World Health Organization (WHO), 2007) 
L.  The Society of Actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000.00) a year: five billion dollars ($5,000,000,000.00) in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and four billion, six hundred million dollars ($4,600,000,000.00) in lost productivity. (Behan, D.F.; Eriksen, M.P.; Lin, Y., "Economic Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Society of Actuaries, March 31, 2005) 
M.  Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smoke-free. Creation of smoke-free workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. & Smith, L. The effect of ordinances requiring smoke-free restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001) 
N.  Hundreds of communities in the U.S., plus numerous states, including California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, have enacted laws requiring workplaces, restaurants, bars, and other public places to be smoke-free, as have numerous countries, including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, and Uruguay. 
O.  There is no legal or constitutional "right to smoke." Business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. On the contrary, employers have a common law duty to provide their workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous. 
P.  Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997)

1.  Require new industries or industries with significant increases in discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristic and obtain prior approval for discharges; 
2.  Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate by the city; 
3.  Require pretreatment of such wastes to within the limits of normal sewage as defined in Section 13.04.010 of this chapter; 
4.  Require control or flow equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any slugloads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works; 
5.  Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and treating such wastes. 
B.  If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the superintendent and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(Prior code § 50.042) 
13.04.250 - Preliminary treatment facilities. 
    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense. 
(Prior code § 50.043) 
13.04.260 - Control manhole-Measurements, tests and analyses. 
A.  When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Agents of the city, the State Water Pollution Control Agencies, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing. 
B.  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole, except for applications for NPDES permits and report thereof which shall be conducted in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the USEPA published in the Federal Register October 16, 1973 (38 CFR 20758) and any subsequent revisions subject to approval by the city. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(Prior code § 50.044) 
13.04.270 - Industrial wastes-Special agreements. 
    No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern, at such rates as are compatible with Sections 13.04.350 through 13.04.420 of this chapter.

Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs, excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount determinable as follows: 
A.  Class I Users. 
1.  Metered Users. The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as herein otherwise provided. For the purposes of billing and collecting the charges for sewer service, the water meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be billed monthly (or a period equaling a month). 
2.  Unmetered Users (Prohibited for Industrial and Governmental Users). For commercial or institutional users of the sewage works that are unmetered water user or accurate meter readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be determined by the city based on comparison with a similar enterprise with each month (or period equaling a month). 
B.  Class II Users. 
1.  Metered Users (With a Six-Month Average Water Meter Reading). The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. For the purposes of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, annual residential rates shall be billed monthly (or a period equaling a month), based on the average monthly water consumption which is to be computed on May 1st of each year. The average monthly water consumption shall be determined by the average monthly use for the period of October 1st through March 31st immediately preceding the May 1st computation. New residential users (with less than a six-month average meter reading) shall pay the unmetered rate (see subsection (B)(2) of this section) until an average monthly water consumption for the full October 1st through March 31st can be made. 
2.  Unmetered Users. For residential users of the sewage works that are unmetered water users, new residential users or accurate meter readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be determined as an average of single family dwelling units. Sewage service bills shall be rendered once each month (or period equaling a month). 
C.  Metered Water Users. The water usage schedule on which the amount of such rates and charges shall be determined is as follows:

The inspection fee shall be imposed as a part of an "Inspection Services Agreement" executed between the owner and/or developer and the Franklin board of public works. 
2.  The execution of an "Inspection Services Agreement" which includes the requirement of obtaining licensed inspection services from consultants approved by the Franklin board of public works, at the expense of the owner and/or developer, shall be mandatory for all projects requiring one thousand (1,000) feet or more of sanitary and/or storm sewer either singly or in combination. Approval of projects requiring less than one thousand (1,000) feet of sanitary and/or storm sewer may require an "Inspection Services Agreement" if such agreement is required by the board of public works. 
(Ord. 04-01 § 1; prior code § 50.071) 
13.04.370 - Billing. 
    The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as is provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed, but quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system. 
A.  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by Indiana Cities Water Corporation or such other water utility serving the city and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determining of sewage discharge. 
B.  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city and, in addition, is a user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge. 
C.  In the event two or more residential units, parcels of real estate, or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter; then in each case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user and the base charge, the flow rates and charges and minimum charge shall apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served through the single water meter. 
D.  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the city's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested party shall, at his or her expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge. 
E.  Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as well as for other uses, the city may, in its discretion, make adjustments in the user charge as may be equitable. 
(Prior code § 50.072) 
13.04.380 - Determination of strength limits-Surcharge. 
    In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times. 
A.  Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical oxygen demand of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in excess of two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid or nitrogen in excess of thirty (30) milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treatment of stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis: 
1.  Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids: there shall be an additional charge of fifteen cents ($0.15) per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received in excess of two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid. 
2.  Rate surcharge based upon BOD: there shall be an additional charge of nineteen cents ($0.19) per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of fluid. 
3.  Rate surcharge based upon NH 3 N: there shall be an additional charge of forty-one cents ($0.41) per pound of ammonia nitrogen received in excess of thirty (30) milligrams per liter of fluid. 
B.  1.  To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and analysis shall be made from time to time whenever it is deemed desirable by the city. After charges have been established based upon the strength of sewage and wastes, an owner may request reconsideration of the charges by the city by submitting analysis of composite samples of the sewage and waste subject to such charges, certified by a registered engineer or a qualified graduate chemist. The city may then adjust the charges to the ordinance rates required by such analysis or may recheck the findings by additional samplings and analysis. Requests for rate adjustments by the owner may be submitted no more often than once every twelve (12) months; 
2.  The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest editions of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes", or similar publications as published by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association or the Water Pollution Control Federation. 
(Prior code § 50.073) 
13.04.390 - Collection. 
    The rates and charges shall be prepared, billed and collected by the city in the manner provided by law and ordinance. 
A.  The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed monthly. Each user shall be given a notice of the rates charged for operation, maintenance and replacement for that user for the next year. 
B.  The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event payment is not made as required by this chapter. The owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
C.  As provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are declared to be delinquent and a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. Payment of rates and charges is due on the last day of the month.

(Ord. No. 10-17, § 1, 11-15-2010) 
13.04.400 - Periodic study and analysis of rates by city. 
    In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users in each user class, the city may cause a study to be made within a reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation, following the date on which this chapter goes into effect. The study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements and capital improvements to the waste treatment systems. 
A.  On an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time following the normal accounting period, the city may cause a study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the sufficiency of the revenues to properly operate the wastewater treatment facility and all appurtenances attached thereto, and maintaining proportionality among the user classes of the rates and charges for sewage services. 
B.  The studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public accountants or engineers as the city shall determine to be best under the circumstances. 
(Prior code § 50.075) 
13.04.410 - Special rate contracts. 
    The city, through the board of public works and safety, is authorized to enter into special rate contracts with customers or wholesale customers of the sewage works where clearly definable cost to the sewage works can be determined, and such special rates shall be based on such costs. However, this section does not authorize the board of public works and safety to provide service without charge under any circumstances whatsoever. 
(Prior code § 50.076) 
13.04.420 - Effective date. 
    The rates and charges as set forth in this chapter shall become effective on the first full billing period occurring after the adoption of this chapter. 
(Prior code § 50.077) 
13.04.430 - Reactivating lapsed service.

This report must include whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports. 
B.  Monthly Reports. This requirement calls for the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users that are necessary to assess and assure compliance by IUs with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. These reports will be required on a monthly basis. 
C.  Baseline Report (403.12(b)). 
1.  Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such Categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW will be required to submit to the control authority a report containing the information listed in paragraph (b) (l)-(7) of 403.12(b). 
2.  Upon promulgation of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the control authority (either U.S. EPA, state or POTW) will provide the appropriate 12(b) form for distribution to the IUs who are affected by the promulgated standard.

The schedule contains increments of progress (i.e., hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction, and the like), which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the IU to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. 
2.  All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the control authority no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the compliance schedule including the final date for compliance. This report must include, at a minimum whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more than nine months elapse between such progress reports. 
E.  Compliance Date Report (403.12(d)). 
1.  Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard, any industrial user subject to those standards must submit to the control authority report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge generated from the regulated process which are limited by Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
2.  The report must also state whether applicable standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharge into compliance. This statement should be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 
F.  Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance (403.12(e)). Any discharger subject to an applicable pretreatment standard must submit to the authority during the months of June and December, or more frequently. if required by the authority, following the final compliance date of that pretreatment standard, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the discharge which are limited by the Categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report must include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows are to be reported on the basis of actual measurement, except, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize submission of the reports on months other than those specified above. 
(Prior code § 51.40) 
13.08.190 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  Each discharger must provide and operate at his or her own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each process wastewater discharge to the authority.

13.08.280 - Annual publication of violators. 
    A list of all dischargers which were the subject of significant enforcement proceedings pursuant to provisions of this chapter or state or federal regulations during the previous calendar year must be published annually by the authority in the largest daily newspaper in the municipality in which the authority is located. The article should summarize the enforcement actions taken against the dischargers during the calendar year in which violation remained uncorrected forty-five (45) or more days after notification of noncompliance; or which have exhibited a pattern of noncompliance over that one-year period, or which involve failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(Prior code § 51.60) 
13.08.290 - Appeals. 
    Any discharger or any interested party has the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by a municipal ordinance and is entitled to a prompt written reply.

16.04.030 - Interpretation and application.* 
A.  Conflicting Requirements. The provisions of this title shall be the minimum requirements necessary for the protection of the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the community. The provisions are also designed to establish and maintain reasonable community standards for the physical environment. If two or more provisions of this title are in conflict, or are inconsistent with one another, then the provision that is most restrictive shall control. 
B.  Overlapping Regulations. When this title, along with private covenants; private contracts; commitments; permits; agreements; state laws; federal laws; and/or other regulations apply to a structure or parcel of land, the greater restriction shall control. In no instance shall this title be interpreted as altering or negating any other applicable regulations. 
1.  Public Provisions. This title is not intended to interfere with, supersede, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of this title imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law; whichever provisions are more restrictive, or impose higher standards, shall apply. 
2.  Private Provisions. This title is not intended to supersede any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction; however, where the provisions of this title are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of this title shall control. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations that are more restrictive, or higher standards than the requirement of these regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with this title, then such private provisions shall be supplemental to this title. (Note: Private provisions are only enforced privately, and are not enforced by the city of Franklin.) 
C.  Compliance. No person shall divide, record, transfer, or sell any parcel of land before the proposed subdivision has been approved in accordance with the processes and provisions of this title, and filed with the county recorder, unless otherwise specified by this title.

No improvement location permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel of land that was created by subdivision after the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of this title. No excavation of land or construction of any public or private improvements shall take place except in conformity with the regulations contained in this title, any other applicable standards adopted by the city of Franklin, and the standards of the local utility providers. 
E.  Subdivision Defined. The division of any lot for the purpose of sale, transfer, gift, or lease that results in the creation of one or more new building sites shall be considered a subdivision and shall be subject to the requirements of this title.

(Ord. No. 2013-07, § 1(Exh. A), 6-17-2013) 
*  Intent: The intent of the technical review committee is to provide a coordinated and thorough review of all proposed subdivisions and to ensure that all applicable requirements are met. By establishing this body, applications can be reviewed by all necessary departments, local agencies, and utility providers at one meeting. Such review helps to identify issues early in the process, and eliminates the need for multiple meetings and individual correspondence between the applicant and each of these departments and agencies. 
Note: The intent of including plan commission members on the technical review committee is to ensure continuity throughout the review process. The plan commission members' roles are not to supersede an area of expertise of other technical review committee members. 
16.12.070 - Sketch plan.*

iv.  Preliminary concepts for connection with existing street, sanitary sewage, and drainage systems; 
v.  A general description of the size, dimensions, and number of lots to be created in the subdivision. 
2.  Contiguous Holdings Map. Whenever the sketch plan covers only a part of an applicant's contiguous property holdings, the applicant shall also submit a map of all contiguous holdings, drawn at a convenient scale. The map shall include a sketch of the proposed subdivision area and an indication of the likely future street, sanitary sewer, and drainage systems serving the remaining portion of the property. 
(Ord. 05-07 § 2.7) 
*  Intent: The sketch plan provisions are intended to provide a structured opportunity for the applicant and the planning director to discuss a proposed subdivision.

4.  Asphalt Surface Exception. A subdivider may request permission, in writing, of the city engineer to delay the installation of the surface layer of asphalt until the binder layer has had a sufficient time period to prove its durability under the stress of traffic. The subdivider shall be required to submit a separate performance surety to cover the cost of the installation of the surface layer of asphalt. 
5.  Amount and Time Frame. The surety shall be in an amount and time period sufficient to adequately maintain completed improvements or to install yet incomplete improvements in compliance with this title. The subdivider's engineer or contractor shall supply an estimate of the cost of the improvements and their installation to aid the city engineer in the determination of the amount of the surety. The petitioner's estimate, however, shall not be binding. 
a.  Maintenance Surety. Maintenance surety shall be provided in an amount equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the cost of the public improvements and their installation and shall be provided for a period of three years from the date the improvements are accepted by the board of public works and safety.

The board of public works and safety may grant a maximum one year extension of the surety period, provided that replacement surety, reflecting the new time frame, is provided by the subdivider. 
c.  Multiple-Use Surety. If multiple types of improvements (such as street surface and sanitary sewers) are included on a single surety, the board of public works and safety shall be permitted to use the entire bond amount for the installation of a single improvement, regardless of any itemization that has been established. 
6.  Form of Surety. The surety shall be provided in the form of a bond, a certified check, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a certificate of deposit. The surety shall be consistent with U.S. Circular 570 and any subsequent amendments. 
7.  Applicability. The surety shall specifically list the name of the subdivision (including phase and/or section) to which it applies, the date from which it is valid, the time period for which it is valid, the public improvements to which it applies, and whether it is "maintenance" or "performance" surety. The surety shall further comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the city attorney, city engineer, planning director, and clerk-treasurer as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in this title. 
D.  Performance Surety Reduction. The amount of performance surety may be reduced upon the actual dedication and acceptance of portions of the public improvements for which the surety was originally posted. A maximum of two reductions are permitted during the life of any surety. Any such reduction shall be at the discretion of the board of public works and safety, based on the recommendation of the city engineer. The reduction of performance surety shall follow the procedure for the release of performance surety provided by Section 16.24.020. 
E.  Building Permit Limitations. No improvement location permits shall be issued for structures on the final twenty-five (25) percent or two lots (whichever is greater) in a subdivision section until all public improvements have been accepted by the board of public works and safety, and all performance surety for that section has been converted to maintenance surety.

16.28.050 - Street arrangement standards.* 
A.  General Requirements. The arrangement, character, width, grade, and location of all streets shall be consistent with existing and planned streets, existing topography, public convenience and safety, and the proposed land uses in the subdivision. 
1.  Thoroughfare Plan. The arrangement of all streets within each subdivision shall conform to the city thoroughfare plan. Where the thoroughfare plan indicates the development of street system extensions or improvements, the construction and dedication of those streets shall be incorporated into the subdivision design. Rights-of-way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and of the width recommended by the thoroughfare plan. 
2.  Natural Features. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land in order to produce usable lots, provide streets of reasonable gradient, and preserve the aesthetic quality and natural drainage provided by the topography and natural features of the property. 
3.  Access. The street layout shall provide adequate vehicular access to all lots and within the subdivision, to any remaining tract, and to all adjacent undeveloped properties and stubbed streets. 
B.  Design Considerations. In designing and reviewing subdivision street systems, the following factors shall receive consideration: 
1.  Accessibility for emergency vehicles and school buses; 
2.  Safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
3.  Efficiency of service for all users; 
4.  Connectivity between subdivisions and the development of complete communities; and 
5.  Economy of both construction and use of land. 
C.  Private Streets. The use of any private street is specifically discouraged. 
1.  Construction Standards. All private streets shall comply with all city standards for public street construction. This shall include, but not be limited to, sidewalks, street trees, pavement width and construction, and drainage. 
2.  Width. All private streets shall be included in an easement of width equal to the right-of-way that would be required if the street were public. This easement shall not be counted as a part of any lot for the purpose of that lot meeting the minimum size requirements for the district in which it is located. 
D.  Pond Locations. No subdivision shall be designed or constructed to allow any portion of a pond to encroach into a street right-of-way. If any portion of a pond is located within the building set-back or build-to line or the slope from the street surface to the water's edge exceeds 1:5 (rise: run) then guard rails shall be required along the roadway consistent with the specifications of the city engineer and the standards of the Indiana Department of Transportation. 
E.  Street Arrangement. The arrangement of streets in all subdivisions shall promote the continuation of existing and proposed street systems, as well as the street system to be provided as a result of the subdivision construction. 
1.  Street Functions. Local streets shall be designed and arranged to discourage their use by through traffic. Arterial and collector streets shall be designed to promote through traffic. Collector streets shall be used to create connections between subdivisions consistent with the Franklin thoroughfare plan. 
2.  Continuation of Existing and Proposed Street Systems. The arrangement of streets in all subdivisions shall provide for the continuation of existing and proposed streets on immediately adjacent properties and in surrounding areas consistent with the Franklin thoroughfare plan. 
3.  Continuation of Subdivision Streets. Right-of-way of proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the proposed subdivision so that either: (1) at least one connection may be made to each adjacent undeveloped property; or (2) at least one connection may be made for every one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet of property line shared between the subdivision and adjacent undeveloped property. In cases where these provisions are in conflict, that which provides the most points of connectivity shall apply. 
a.  The plan commission may waive this requirement in cases where the commission deems that any such extension is not feasible due to topography or other physical conditions, or not appropriate for the development of adjacent property consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
b.  No subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate the land-locking of any adjacent property. 
4.  Dead-End Streets. All permanent dead-end streets shall include a cul-de-sac meeting the standards of Section 16.28.080. A temporary dead-end street may be permitted in any case in which a street is designed to be extended to adjacent properties in the future. 
a.  Any temporary dead-end street that extends more than two hundred (200) feet in length shall be provided with a temporary cul-de-sac or other turn-around consistent with the requirements of the city engineer. 
b.  Any temporary turn-around shall be included in a roadway easement that shall be vacated to the property owners at the time the street is extended or the city engineer determines that the turn-around is no longer needed. 
c.  All temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with street signs (consistent with Section 16.18.030) that indicate the road as being a "temporary dead-end". The subdivider shall assume all costs of the installation of the signs. 
5.  Additional Collector Streets. The plan commission may require that streets anticipated to serve the lot counts specified below be designed, constructed, and designated as collector streets in addition to those shown on the city thoroughfare plan. 
a.  Streets anticipated to serve between one hundred fifty (150) and three hundred (300) lots may be considered secondary collector streets. 
b.  Streets anticipated to serve greater than three hundred (300) lots may be considered primary collector streets. 
F.  Limited Access Highway/Railroad Accommodation. Where a subdivision borders on, or contains an existing or proposed interstate or other limited access highway or a railroad right-of-way, the plan commission may require: (1) a street approximately parallel to, and on each side of the right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land; or (2) screening meeting the requirements of Section 16.28.030(C). 
1.  Parallel street separation distances shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades, future grade separations, and adequate locations for nonresidential land uses. Streets parallel to a railroad shall be a minimum of two hundred (200) feet (measured from the edge of each right-of-way) from that railroad when intersecting a street that crosses the railroad at grade. 
2.  The plan commission may require that any landscaped areas or intervening land strips be dedicated to the city as right-of-way, or to a lot owners association for the subdivision in which they are located. 
G.  Half-Streets (Single Lane Streets). The construction and/or dedication of half-streets shall be prohibited. Whenever a half-street is adjacent to a property to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted and constructed within the subdivision. 
H.  Improvement of Existing Streets. Whenever a proposed subdivision borders or includes an existing street the design and construction of the subdivision shall include the reconstruction, re-alignment, or widening of such street; the provision of sidewalks; and any other improvement consistent with the requirements of this title for new streets developed as a part of a subdivision. 
1.  Right-of-Way. Additional dedication of right-of-way may be required consistent with the adopted thoroughfare plan and/or for the construction of adequate passing blisters or tapers at intersections. The right-of-way shall be obtained by the subdivider and dedicated to the city prior to secondary plat approval. 
2.  Intersection Improvements. At the intersection of a subdivision street or planned drive with an existing street, the subdivider shall install deceleration, acceleration, and passing lanes meeting the requirements of the city engineer. 
a.  These improvements shall require a one-inch overlay of bituminous surface, which extends across the full width of the existing street in addition to the new features. 
b.  The extreme ends of any taper and/or blister shall be the limits of the required improvements. 
c.  Butt joints shall be milled at the ends of the improvements to ensure a smooth transition.

3.  Required Outlets. All lots within each subdivision shall be provided with a drainage system connected to a working outlet such as a natural stream, a storm sewer, or an existing open ditch. In no case shall a field tile be considered an acceptable outlet. No connection draining stormwater runoff shall be made to a sanitary sewer. 
4.  Positive Drainage from Structures. All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from all structures and dispose of such water without ponding in locations other than intended dry or wet detention basins. 
5.  Runoff and Erosion Control Systems. Runoff and erosion control systems shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development. Perimeter and entrance/exit erosion facilities are required to be installed prior to the start of any site work. All basins shall be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific locations for ease of maintenance. 
6.  Emergency Flood Routing. An adequate emergency flood route shall be provided for each subdivision, which will function with the storm system completely obstructed. 
B.  Professional Design Requirements. The plans for the installation of the storm sewer system shall be prepared by a professional engineer or surveyor licensed in the state of Indiana. The subdivider's engineer shall also study the effects of each subdivision on the existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.

5.  Detention Design. All detention design shall conform to the current soil conservation service hydrograph methods for drainage, or an approved equal as determined by the city engineer. The design of all drainage facilities shall include analysis of all storm durations (one, two, three, six, twelve (12) and twenty-four (24) hours) to determine the critical peak to be used. The rational method is acceptable for pipe design only. 
a.  All drainage outlets shall be sized to meet all downstream drainage constraints. 
b.  If the natural downstream channel of the storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided, then one of the following alternatives shall be used: 
i.  The allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional storage volume, meeting the requirements of the city engineer, shall be provided to accommodate capacity exceeding runoff; or 
ii.  The subdivider shall correct the downstream restriction. 
6.  Pre-Development Runoff Rates. In all subdivisions, the pre-developed runoff rates shall be based on pasture, meadow, brush or woods ground cover types in good hydraulic condition. Any existing farm ground will be based on the pasture cover type, in good hydrologic condition. 
7.  Underground Drainage Facilities. The subdivider shall provide for the continuation of underground drainage facilities. 
8.  Structures. All structures shall be sized to allow inspection and maintenance. Concrete riser rings shall be permitted in order to allow structures to be adjusted up to a maximum of one foot. 
9.  Underdrains. The subdivider shall provide a subsurface drainage system, below curbs, along both sides of the subdivision streets and wherever else within the subdivision that it is determined to be necessary by the city engineer. 
D.  Sump Pumps, Downspouts, and Foundation Drains. It shall be illegal for sump pumps, downspouts, or foundation drains to outlet directly to the street or into the right-of-way of the street, or to be connected to the sanitary sewer. 
1.  Sump Pumps. In no case shall a sump pump be used for more than one function; sump pumps shall be used only for the discharge of stormwater. Sump pumps shall discharge onto a grass surface in the side or rear yard and no closer than twenty-five (25) feet to the right-of-way of any street. 
2.  Downspouts and Roof Drains. Downspouts and roof drains shall be discharged no closer to the street than the building setback line, with the exception of single-family residential downspouts and roof drains. All single-family residential downspouts and roof drains shall discharge onto a grass surface no closer than twenty-five (25) feet to the right-of-way of any street. 
3.  Outlet Points. A discharge pipe which outlets onto the surface of the ground shall have its point of discharge outside the boundaries of any drainage or utility easement or street right-of-way. Discharge pipes directed toward or into an open drainage swale or ditch shall provide sufficient separation distance so as to provide sufficient area for reasonable absorption of water into the soil without creating erosion control problems. 
E.  Street Drainage.* All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system consisting of curbs, gutters, storm sewers, and inlets or side ditches and/or culverts, consistent with the specifications of the city engineer, the appropriate street design standards provided by Section 16.28.060, and the following requirements:

17.04.040 - Official zoning map. 
A.  Official Zoning Map. The zoning map for the city of Franklin, officially labeled "Official City of Franklin, Indiana Zoning Map," is included as part of this title. The map may also be known and referred to as the "official zoning map" and as the "zoning map." The official zoning map shall include the ordinance number by which it was adopted and the date of adoption. 
B.  Official Zoning Map Copies. Copies of the official zoning map may be made and distributed to interested persons. The official zoning map copies shall be labeled as copies and have the date which they were last modified printed on them. 
C.  Location of the Official Zoning Map. The official zoning map will be located in the office of the Franklin plan commission. 
D.  Zoning District Boundaries and Identification. The zoning district boundaries shall be as shown on the official zoning map. The abbreviations for the zoning districts appearing in this title shall be used to identify the zoning districts on the official zoning map. Planned unit developments shall be indicated on the official zoning map using the three-digit "PUD" abbreviation and the ordinance number by which each PUD is created. Rezonings that include conditions shall be noted as such. 
E.  Regular Revisions. The official zoning map should be formally revised annually, or otherwise as the plan commission determines necessary. 
1.  Zoning Map Amendments. A notation on the official zoning map shall be made within two business days of the effective date of any approved ordinance making a zoning map amendment. The notation shall be made either electronically or though a permanent-pen hand written note. The notation shall include the ordinance number by which the change was approved and the date of the approval by the city council. 
2.  Errors and Omissions. Other revisions may be made to correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the zoning map, but shall not have the effect of amending the map. 
F.  Damaged, Destroyed or Lost Official Zoning Map. In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret, the city council may, by ordinance, adopt a new official zoning map which shall, to the extent possible, duplicate the accuracy of the damaged, destroyed or lost map. Unless the prior map has been lost or completely destroyed, it or any significant parts shall be preserved, together with any available records of its adoption and amendment. 
G.  Interpretation Standards. Zoning district boundaries on the official zoning map shall be interpreted as follows: 
1.  Streets and Easements. Zoning district boundaries shown within the lines of roads, easements, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the center lines. 
2.  Property Lines. Zoning district boundaries indicated as following section or fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines, or city corporation lines shall be construed as following such lines. 
3.  Bodies of Water. Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the center line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed as moving with any change in the actual shore line. 
4.  Divided Lots. Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the zoning in which the majority of the area of the property is included shall apply to the entire property. In cases where a property is divided equally between two or more zoning districts, the least intense district shall apply to the entire property. The planning director shall determine the applicable zoning for properties divided into multiple zoning districts consistent with this section. 
5.  Extensions of Lines. Zoning district boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of the features listed in subsection (G)(1) through (4) above shall be construed as so. 
H.  Interpretation Procedure. The planning director shall determine the applicable zoning for each property in the plan commission's jurisdiction as described in subsection (G)(1) through (5) of this section. 
1.  Appeals of Planning Director Interpretations. Any ruling of the planning director pertaining to the district boundaries may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals. 
2.  Plan Commission Interpretation Required. If the planning director cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary, immediate action on any affected application shall be refused. The plan commission shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the official zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this title. This interpretation may occur as part of a regular or special plan commission meeting and does not require a public hearing. Decisions of the plan commission may not be appealed to the board of zoning appeals, but may be appealed to a court of jurisdiction. 
I.  Effect of Vacation on Zoning. Whenever any street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by the proper authority, the zoning districts adjoining each side of vacated areas shall be extended automatically to the center of the vacated area. All areas included in the vacation shall then be subject to all regulations of the extended zoning districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining zoning district, or zoning district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all of the vacated area. The resolution of any disputes as to the exact zoning district boundaries shall be determined by the planning director. Appeals of the planning director's determination may be brought before the board of zoning appeals.

Any application that is inconsistent with the version approved by the technical review committee shall be referred back to the TRC for review and comment. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 2.4) 
*  Intent: The intent of the technical review committee is to provide a coordinated and thorough review of all development plans and to ensure that all applicable requirements are met. By establishing this body, applications can be reviewed by all necessary departments, local agencies, and utility providers at one meeting. Such review helps to identify issues early in the process, and eliminates the need for multiple meetings and individual correspondence between the applicant and each of these departments and agencies. 
Note: The intent of including plan commission members on the technical review committee is to ensure continuity throughout the review process. The plan commission members' roles are not to supersede an area of expertise of other technical review committee members.

If such application complies with all established requirements and this title, an improvement location permit for the execution of the approved variance or special exception shall be issued. 
K.  Expiration of Approvals. A special exception or variance ceases to be authorized and is expired if the obtaining of an improvement location permit, or the execution of the approval has not been completed within one year of the date the variance or special exception is granted.

Chapter 17.16 - ZONING DISTRICTS* 
Sections: 

17.16.010 - Establishment of zoning districts.* 
A.  Establishment of Zoning Districts. For the purpose of this chapter, the planning jurisdiction is divided into the following zoning districts. Each of the zoning districts stands alone and is not part of a hierarchy-system of zoning. For example, uses permitted in the MXN district are not permitted in the MXC district unless expressly listed as such in the MXC district. Only those uses and standards that are expressly indicated and noted for each district apply to that district. 
1. Agricultural Zoning District. A - Agricultural 2. Single-Family Residential Zoning Districts. RR - Residential, Rural RSN - Residential, Suburban Neighborhood RS-1 - Residential, Suburban One RS-2 - Residential, Suburban Two RS-3 - Residential, Suburban Three RTN - Residential, Traditional Neighborhood RT-1 - Residential, Traditional One RT-2 - Residential, Traditional Two RT-3 - Residential, Traditional Three 3. Multifamily Residential Zoning Districts. RM - Residential, Multifamily RMH - Residential, Manufactured Home Park 4. Mixed-Use Zoning Districts. MXD - Mixed-Use, Downtown Center MXN - Mixed-Use, Neighborhood Center MXC - Mixed-Use, Community Center MXR - Mixed-Use, Regional Center 5. Institutional Zoning District. IN - Institutional 6. Industrial Zoning Districts. IBD - Industrial, Business Development IL - Industrial, Light IG - Industrial, General  
B.  Establishment of Planned Unit Development District. This chapter allows for any zoning district(s) to be rezoned for the creation of a planned unit development. All planned unit developments shall be consistent with the requirements of Chapter 17.24 of this title. 
C.  Subdivision of Land. The subdivision of land in every zoning district shall be consistent with the provisions of the applicable subdivision control ordinance for the jurisdiction in which the property is located. 
(Ord. 05-21 § 1 (part)) 
*  See also: Chapter 17.20, Performance Zoning; Chapter 17.24, Overlay Zoning; Chapter 17.28, Planned Unit Development. 
17.16.020 - Land uses.* 
A.  Land Uses Specified. Each land use is either a permitted, nonpermitted or a special exception use in each zoning district. A general list of permitted and special exception uses for each district are noted in the "Permitted Uses" and "Special Exceptions" columns accompanying the description of each district in this section. Specific land uses within each general category are listed in the Land Use Matrix set out in this section. 
B.  Unlisted or Questionable Land Uses. Any use not listed as a permitted use or special exception use is considered nonpermitted. The planning director may determine into which category any questionable use is placed if it is not specifically listed but is similar to another use that is a permitted or a special exception use. This determination may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals consistent with the provisions of Section 17.48.050 for appeals of administrative decisions.

Chapter 17.17 - BUFFERING AND SCREENING STANDARDS 
Sections: 

17.17.010 - Intent. 
    The purpose of these buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts between the possible uses in one zoning district and those use in adjacent districts through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of conflict between the zoning districts determines the extent of the buffer required. 
(Ord. 05-21 § 1 (part)) 
17.17.020 - General buffering and screening standards. 
    The following general buffering standards apply to all zoning districts: 
A.  Buffer Yard Requirements. The buffer yard requirements table describes the type of buffer yard that shall be installed. The required buffer yards shall meet the following minimum standards: 
1.  Buffer Yard Type 1. Buffer yard type 1 shall include a minimum setback of ten (10) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this chapter. In addition, one broad-leaf deciduous canopy tree must be planted in the buffer yard for every thirty (30) feet of boundary between the subject and adjoining properties. 
2.  Buffer Yard Type 2. Buffer yard type 2 shall include a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this chapter. In addition, one broad-leaf deciduous canopy tree or two evergreen conifers shall be planted in the buffer yard for every twenty-five (25) feet of boundary between the properties. 
3.  Buffer Yard Type 3. Buffer yard type 3 shall include a minimum setback of twenty-five (25) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this chapter. In addition, a row of broad-leaf deciduous canopy trees shall be planted parallel to the property line within the buffer yard with one tree placed every twenty (20) feet along the boundary between the subject and adjoining properties. Also, a six foot tall opaque wooden fence or brick/stone wall, a five foot tall undulating mound planted with shrubs, or a row of evergreen conifers shall be provided. 
a.  If an undulating mound is used the slope shall be a maximum of three is to one (rise:run), one shrub for every ten (10) feet of continuous boundary shall be planted on the mound. All required shrubs shall be eighteen (18) inches tall, measured from grade, at planting. 
b.  If a row of evergreen trees is used, one tree shall be placed every ten (10) feet along the property boundary. All evergreen trees shall be five feet in height, measured from the top of the rootball, at the time of planting. 
Buffer Yard Requirements 
The Buffer yard type indicated on the table of this section shall be provided on the subject property when... ...the zoning for the subject property is... ..and adjoining property is zoned: A RR RSN RS RTN RT RM RMH MXD MXN MXC MXR IN IBD IL IG A 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 RR 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 RSN 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 RS 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 RTN 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 3 3 RT 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 3 3 RM 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 3 RMH 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 MXD 2 2 2 MXN 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 MXC 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 MXR 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 IN 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 IBD 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 IL 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 IG 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2  

B.  Buffer Yard Standards. The buffer yard standards only apply along the property lines where the two conflicting zoning districts meet as specified in the buffer yard requirements table. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the presence of streets, alleys, streams and other features separating property lines in conflicting zoning districts. 
1.  Responsibility. The developer or owner of the property being developed or otherwise changed in use is responsible for installing the buffer yard at the time of that development or change. The adjacent property owner shall not have to participate in installing the buffer yard. 
2.  Buffer Yard Location. All required buffer yard areas shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall be in addition to setbacks required by this chapter. 
3.  Planting Location. Required buffer yard trees may be placed either at regular intervals or in irregular patterns representing a natural landscape. However, no two buffer yard trees (excluding evergreen trees) shall be placed within ten (10) feet of one another. No buffer yard or required landscape materials shall be placed within any easement, right-of-way, or septic field. 
4.  Tree Size. All broad leaf/deciduous trees must have at least a two and one-half inch caliper measured at six inches above the top of the rootball, and all evergreen conifers must be a minimum of five feet in height measured from the top of the rootball when planted. 
5.  Ground Cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees, shrubs or other landscaped materials shall be covered with grass or other ground covering vegetation. Landscaping stone or other nonvegetative surfaces may not be substituted for ground covering vegetation. 
6.  Application. No landscaping required by this chapter may be used to satisfy the minimum requirements of any other provisions of this chapter. 
7.  Maintenance. All landscape materials must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly appearance, free from all debris and refuse. 
a.  All plant material which is unhealthy or dead, in the opinion of the planning director, shall be replaced by the end of the next spring or fall planting season. 
b.  Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth inhibiting measures may only be used to ensure the public safety. 
(Ord. 05-21 § 1 (part)) 
Note: All buffer yard plant materials shall comply with Sections 17.32.160(A)(5) and (A)(6) of this title. Please refer to the Qualifying Broad Leaf/Deciduous Tree table and the Nonqualifying Tree table of Section 17.32.160 of this title. 
17.17.030 - Materials and equipment buffering and screening standards. 
    The following materials and equipment buffering standards apply to the multifamily residential, mixed-use, institutional and industrial zoning districts as follows: 
A.  Ground Level Requirements. All outdoor storage areas for completed products manufactured on-site, production materials, and equipment; dumpsters and waste containers; and mechanical equipment located on the ground shall be screened consistent with the following requirements. In no instance shall this be interpreted as applying to merchandise for sale that is temporarily or seasonally placed outdoors. 
1.  Fencing. A minimum six foot tall, one hundred (100) percent opaque fence of wood, brick, or stone construction shall completely screen the area from the view of public streets and adjacent properties. Opaque, six-foot tall wooden gates shall be provided to access the facility. The gates shall generally remain closed, except when immediate access to the area is required. 
2.  Landscape Screening. Evergreen planting shall be provided around the exterior perimeter of the required fencing. 
a.  If evergreen shrubs are used they shall be a minimum of three feet tall at the time of planting, and planted at a maximum of five feet on center. 
b.  If evergreen trees are used they shall be conifers, a minimum of five feet tall at the time of planting, and shall be planted a maximum of twenty (20) feet on center. 
B.  Roof-top Requirements. All roof-top equipment, such as HVAC units, shall be screened from the view of all public streets by parapets, dormers, or other screens. The material of all such screens shall be consistent with the exterior materials used on the facade of the structure. 
(Ord. 05-21 § 1 (part)) 
Chapter 17.24 - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

17.24.010 - Establishment and general standards.* 
A.  Establishment of Overlay Districts. The overlay districts noted below have been established to provide additional development standards that respond to unique characteristics of the properties to which they apply. The overlay districts will assist Franklin in providing for the public welfare and accomplishing the goals of the comprehensive plan. The development of properties which are located in one or more overlay districts shall be subject to the requirements of both the overlay district(s) and the underlying district in which they are located. The following overlay zoning districts shall apply to properties in the jurisdiction of the Franklin plan commission as specified in the description of each district in this chapter: 
FH-OL - Flood hazard area 
WP-OL - Wellfield protection 
GW-OL - Gateway 
B.  Effect of Planned Unit Development District. All planned unit developments shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. Planned unit developments shall not be subject to the requirements of any overlay district, unless otherwise specified as an element of the planned unit development detailed plan. 
C.  Land Uses. All land uses which are permitted, nonpermitted or a special exception use in any underlying zoning district to which an overlay district is applied shall remain permitted, non-permitted, or special exception uses unless otherwise specified by the applicable overlay district(s). 
D.  Lot, Yard, and Development Standards. Any lot, yard, and development standards established by an overlay district shall apply as follows: 
1.  Replacement of Underlying District Standards. All lot, yard, and development standards established by an underlying zoning district shall apply unless alternate standards are provided by the overlay district(s). 
2.  Additional Overlay District Standards. Properties located in any overlay district(s) shall also be subject to any additional lot, yard, and development standards established by the overlay district(s). 
E.  Performance Standards. In no instance shall any overlay district be interpreted as modifying any performance standards established for the RS and RT zoning districts by Chapter 17.24. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 5.1) 
*  See Also: Chapter 17.16, Zoning Districts; Chapter 17.28, Planned Unit Development. 
17.24.020 - Flood hazard area (FH-OL). 
A.  Definitions. Words used in a special sense exclusive to the application of this chapter are defined as follows. These definitions do not define terms used in any other chapter of this title. However, additional terms may be found in Section 17.08.020, Definitions, that are relevant to this chapter. 
    "A zone" means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below: 
1.  Zone A. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. 
2.  Zone AE and A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.) 
3.  Zone AO. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. 
4.  Zone AH. Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are one to three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. 
5.  Zone AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. 
6.  Zone A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Community" means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    "Community rating system (CRS)" means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    "Critical facility" means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    "Elevated structure" means a nonbasement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
    "Elevation certificate" means a certified statement that verifies a structure's elevation information. 
    "Emergency program" means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    "Existing construction" means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    "Five-hundred year flood (500-year flood)" means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements. 
    "Floodproofing (dry floodproofing)" means a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    "Floodproofing certificate" means a form used to certify compliance for nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
    "Functionally dependent facility" means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Increased cost of compliance (ICC)" means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage. 
    "Lowest adjacent grade" means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    "Map amendment" means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA). 
    "Map panel number" means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first revision.) 
    "Market value" means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values. 
    "Mitigation" means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is two fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery. 
    "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    "National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD)," as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    "New construction" means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    "North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88)," as adopted in 1993, is a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    "Obstruction" means and includes, but is not limited to any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred year flood (100-year flood)" means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See "Regulatory flood." 
    "One-percent annual chance flood" means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See "Regulatory flood." 
    "Participating community" means any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    "Physical map revision (PMR)" means an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs. 
    "Post-FIRM construction" means construction or substantial improvement that started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later. 
    "Pre-FIRM construction" means construction or substantial improvement, which started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    "Probation" means of formally notifying participating communities of violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    "Public safety and nuisance" means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Regular program" means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
    "Repetitive loss" means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten (10) year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event. 
    "Section 1316" means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    "Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement or permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Suspension" means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    "X zone" means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the five-hundred (500) year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent. 
    "Zone" means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Zone A. See definition for A zone. 
    "Zone B, C, and X" means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.) 
B.  Statutory Authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the common council of the city of Franklin does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
C.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of Franklin are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
D.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
6.  Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirement. 
E.  Objectives. 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
7.  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
F.  District Boundaries (Regulatory Flood Elevation). This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval. 
1.  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs of city shall be as delineated on the one hundred (100) year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Johnson County and Incorporated Areas, dated August 2, 2007 and the corresponding FIRM dated August 2, 2007, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. 
2.  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the unstudied SFHAs of city delineated as an "A Zone" on the FIRM of Johnson County and Incorporated Areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
G.  Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations. 
1.  In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern. 
2.  If the elevation of a site in question (near a delineated SFHA) is below the base flood elevation and is not protected by existing means, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly. 
3.  If the elevation (natural grade) of a site in question is above the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will be applied unless the property owner receives a letter of map amendment (LOMA) removing the area from the SFHA. 
H.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
I.  Duties of the Administrator. The planning director shall implement this chapter and be referred to as the floodplain administrator. The floodplain administrator and his/her designees is appointed to review all development and subdivision proposals to ensure compliance with this chapter, including but not limited to the following duties: 
1.  Ensure Compliance. Ensure that all development activities within the statistical flood hazard areas (SFHAs) of the jurisdiction of the city of Franklin meet the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  Provide Information. Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques. 
3.  Ensure Proper Authorization. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for all development projects subject to subsections (J)(2)(a) and (J)(2)(c) of this section, and maintain a record of such authorization (either copy of actual permit, letter of recommendation, or floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment). Ensure that all necessary federal or state permits have been received prior to issuance of the local floodplain development permit. Copies of such permits are to be maintained on file with the floodplain development permit. 
4.  Maintain Construction Records. Maintain a record of the "as built" elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of new and/or substantially improved buildings constructed in the SFHA. Inspect before, during and after construction. 
5.  Maintain Engineering Records. Maintain a record of the engineer's certificate and the "as-built" floodproofed elevation of all buildings subject to subsection M of this section. 
6.  Improve Data. Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program. 
7.  Provide Data. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, letters of map amendment (LOMA), letters of map revision (LOMR), copies of DNR permits and floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment, federal permit documents, and "as-built" elevation and floodproofing data for all building constructed subject to this chapter. 
8.  Enforcement. Utilize and enforce all letters of map revision (LOMR) or physical map revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the community. 
9.  Maintenance. Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
10.  Assist with Notification. Notify adjacent communities and the state coordinating office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
11.  Inspect Damages. Inspect and inventory damaged structure in SFHA and complete substantial damage determinations. 
J.  Improvement Location Permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any "development" in the SFHA without first obtaining an improvement location permit from the floodplain administrator. The floodplain administrator shall not issue an improvement location permit if the proposed "development" does not meet the requirements of this chapter. 
1.  Application Materials. The application for an improvement location permit shall be accompanied by the following: 
a.  Development Description. A description of the proposed development. 
b.  Location Description. Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams. 
c.  Legal Description. A legal description of the property site. 
d.  Site Plan. A site plan showing existing and proposed development locations and existing and proposed land grades. 
e.  Elevations. Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed development or elevation to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed. Elevation should be in North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29). If NGVD 29 is used, the conversion formula should be included. 
g.  Watercourse Alterations (If Required). Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or related as a result of proposed development. 
2.  Review Procedure. Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit, the floodplain administrator shall determine if the site is located within: (1) an identified floodway, (2) an identified floodway fringe, or (3) the floodplain where the limits of the floodway have not yet been determined. 
a.  Identified Floodway Sites. If the site is in an identified floodway the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. 
i.  Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of an improvement location permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvement to existing (lawful) residences in a nonboundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of nonsubstantial additions/improvements to residences in a nonboundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources). Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
ii.  No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a permit has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in subsections K, L, M, N, and O of this section have been met. The improvement location permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
iii.  No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot. 
iv.  For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city of Franklin shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revised the regulatory flood data. 
b.  Identified Floodway Fringe Sites. If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the floodplain administrator may issue the local improvement location permit provided the provisions contained in subsections L, M, N, and O of this section have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade (FPG). 
c.  Undefined Floodplain Sites with Significant Upstream Drainage. If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment. 
i.  No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until either a permit for construction in the floodway or a floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment citing the one hundred (100) year flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
ii.  Once the floodplain administrator has received the proper permit or floodplain analysis and regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, an improvement location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the improvement location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in subsections K, L, M, N, and O of this section have been met. 
d.  Undefined Floodplain Sites with Insignificant Upstream Drainage. If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, floodway fringe and one hundred (100) year elevation for the site. Upon receipt, the floodplain administrator may issue the local improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in subsections K, L, M, N, and O of this section have been met. 
i.  The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. 
3.  Construction Stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor; or floodproofing, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD 29 elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holders' risk. (The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted.) The permit holder shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
K.  Uses. All land uses shall be prohibited in the floodway unless otherwise specified below: 
1.  Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be permitted, provided that they are also permitted by the underlying zoning district: 
a.  Agricultural uses such as crop production, pastures, orchards, tree farms, plant nurseries, and vineyards; 
b.  Forestry, wildlife areas, and nature preserves; and 
c.  Parks and recreational uses (excluding golf courses and driving ranges). 
2.  Special Exception Uses. The following uses shall be special exceptions, provided that they are also permitted or special exceptions in the underlying zoning district: 
a.  Riding stables; 
b.  Public wellfields; 
c.  Sewage treatment facilities (excluding septic fields); 
d.  Parking lots (as primary uses); and 
e.  Golf courses and/or driving ranges. 
L.  Development Standards. 
1.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
2.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
3.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the FPG. 
4.  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
5.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
6.  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
7.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
8.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
9.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. 
10.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not further, extended, or replaced. 
M.  Development Standards-Protecting Buildings. In addition to the damage prevention requirements of subsection L of this section, all buildings to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG. 
1.  Protection Situations. This building protection requirement applies to the following situations: 
a.  Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor area greater than four hundred (400) square feet; 
b.  Structural alterations made to: 
i.  An existing (previously unaltered) structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the pre-altered structure (excluding the value of the land), 
ii.  Any previously altered structure; 
c.  Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure that are valued at or more than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the land) before damage occurred; 
d.  Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and 
e.  Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
2.  Protection Methods. This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of compliance with these building protection standards as required in subsection I of this section. 
a.  Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Should solid foundation walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection (M)(2)(d) of this section. 
b.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Structures located in all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance of subsection (M)(2)(h) of this section. 
c.  Structures on Fill. A residential or nonresidential building may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the following: 
i.  The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than six inches deep before compacting to ninety-five (95) percent of the maximum density obtainable with the standard proctor test method. 
ii.  The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the FPG. 
iii.  The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. 
iv.  The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties. 
v.  The top of the lowest floor including basements, (see definition of lowest floor) shall be at or above the FPG. 
d.  Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
i.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
(A)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; 
(B)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); 
(C)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;

(F)  Portions of the building below the FPG must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. 
e.  Structures Constructed with a Crawlspace. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace located below the FPG provided that the following conditions are met: 
i.  The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
ii.  Any enclosed area below the FPG shall have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more than one foot above grade; 
iii.  The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point; 
iv.  Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the FPG; 
v.  An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period of time after a flood event; 
vi.  Portions of the building below the FPG must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and 
vii.  The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above the base flood elevation. 
f.  Permanent Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days must meet one of the following anchoring requirements: 
i.  The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site: 
(A)  Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(B)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(C)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
(D)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood. 
ii.  This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood. The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
g.  Temporary Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either: 
i.  Be on the site for less than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
ii.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
iii.  Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (M)(2)(f) of this section. 
h.  Floodproofing. A nonresidential building may be floodproofed to the FPG (in lieu of elevating) if done in accordance with the following: 
i.  A registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in subsection (I)(5) of this section. 
ii.  Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity. 
N.  Other Development Standards. The floodplain administrator shall review all proposed subdivisions to determine whether the subdivision lies in a SFHA. 
1.  Flood Hazard Area Subdivisions. If the floodplain administrator finds the subdivision to be so located and areas are to be developed within the floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the petitioner to forward plans and materials to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment. The floodplain administrator shall require appropriate changes and modifications in order to assure that: 
a.  It is consistent with the need to minimize flood damages; 
b.  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
c.  Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; 
d.  On-site waste disposal systems, if provided, will be so located and designed to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during the occurrence of the regulatory flood; 
e.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals. 
2.  Flood Elevation Recording. Developers shall provide the one hundred (100) year flood elevation on all subdivision plats containing lands (identified elsewhere by this chapter) within a flood hazard area prior to submitting the plats for approval by the plan commission. 
O.  Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated at or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
P.  Variances. The board of zoning appeals as established by the common council of the city of Franklin shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this chapter. The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to a court of jurisdiction. Variances to the regulation of this chapter shall be consistent with the following provisions: 
1.  Procedures. In passing upon such application, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this title, and: 
a.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
c.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
d.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
e.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
f.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
g.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. 
h.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
i.  The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site. 
j.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
2.  Standards and Conditions. The board of zoning appeals may issue a variance of exception to the terms and provisions of this chapter subject to the following standards and conditions: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
i.  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship. 
iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances; 
b.  No variance or exception for a residential use within a floodway subject to subsection (J)(2)(a) or (J)(2)(c) of this section may be granted; 
c.  Any variance or exception granted in a floodway subject to subsection (J)(2)(a) or (J)(2)(c) of this section will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; 
d.  Variances or exceptions to the Building Protection Standards of subsection M of this section may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the FPG; 
e.  Variance or exception may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; 
f.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
g.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation; and 
h.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request. 
3.  Variance Notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage. 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
    The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
4.  Historic Structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
5.  Special Conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in subsection P of this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
Q.  Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the city of Franklin, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the state of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
R.  Violations. Failure to obtain an improvement location permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.52, Enforcement and Penalties. 
1.  A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. 
2.  The planning director shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended. 
3.  Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Franklin from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
S.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of Franklin to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall take precedence. In addition, the city of Franklin shall assure that all National Flood Insurance Program regulations (44 CFR Section 60) as well as Indiana laws and regulations regarding floodplain issues (312 IAC 10, IC 14-28-1 and IC-14-28-3) are met. 
T.  Nonconforming Structures and/or Uses in Flood Hazard Areas. Any structure, use, or structure and use in combination that is legal nonconforming due to its presence in a flood hazard area may be altered, enlarged, or extended on a one-time only basis provided that the new construction conforms with the standards included in this chapter and does not increase the value of the structure or use (excluding the value of the land) by more than fifty (50) percent of its pre-improvement market value. Such structures that are legal nonconforming as the result of other, non-flood related conditions shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.44, Nonconformities that address those conditions (such as legal nonconforming uses, structures, etc.).

Illustrative Layout (Does not reflect all requirements established by this title). 
(Ord. 04-09 § 5.4) 
*  Intent: The purpose of this section is to establish an overlay district to address the unique characteristics of the properties adjacent to Franklin's gateway transportation routes. These gateways have unique traffic management needs, development pressures, and aesthetic characteristics that require the establishment of additional development standards to meet the goals of the comprehensive plan and fulfill the purpose of this title. 
The intent of the gateway overlay district is to require development at the city's entrances that is aesthetically consistent, responsive to development pressures, and proportional to the area's traffic management issues. 
17.24.050 - Downtown Overlay (DT-OL). 
    Introduction. The purpose of this chapter [section] is to establish an overlay district to address the unique characteristics of the properties in Franklin's historic downtown. The character of historic towns and the sense of place that it creates are defined by its history, and unique architecture and streetscape. Preservation of this indigenous design not only creates a visually inviting environment, but drives economic development. People are pulled to the human-scaled, pedestrian-oriented environments with an architecture that provides the scale and detail that people innately seek. The general principles behind the following standards are: 
 Retain and restore what you have when practical; 
 Harmonize new structures with the old; 
 Provide for the automobile but design for the pedestrian. 
    These design standards will provide the criteria by which the city council, plan commission, and planning department staff will evaluate development plans for consistency with the implementation policies of the city's downtown plan and the purposes of the Downtown Overlay District. The design standards are required to be met in the Downtown Overlay (DT-OL) Zoning District. Figure 1 outlines the boundaries of the Downtown Overlay Zoning District where the design standards are required to be met. Figure 1 also outlines the boundaries of the integrated economic development area. In this area the design standards should be referenced as guidelines, but are not required. The Franklin Development Corporation offers incentive financing and grants for projects that meet the design standards in the Downtown Overlay Zoning District and for projects that opt to meet the design standards in the integrated economic development area, where the design standards are not required. 
A.  Boundary. The Downtown Overlay (DT-OL) Zoning District shall apply to all properties as indicated on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Franklin (see Figure 1). 

B.  Appeals. Any applicant or interested party may appeal the decision of the planning director (or his or her designee) or the requirements of applicable ordinances to the board of zoning appeals. 
a.  Relief from Specific Requirements. Applicants seeking relief from specific development standards or other requirements of the zoning ordinance that are unrelated to the planning director's interpretation of the applicable requirements shall be required to obtain variance approval from the board of zoning appeals. 
b.  Appeal of Ordinance Interpretation. Applicants seeking an appeal of a decision or interpretation of the planning director may appeal to the board of zoning appeals. 
c.  Appeal Procedure. All appeals of determinations of the planning director shall meet the following requirements: 
i.  The appealing party is required to provide the planning director with written notice of the appeal within thirty (30) days of the date of the planning director's decision. 
ii.  The planning director will place the appeal on the agenda for the next scheduled board of zoning appeals meeting consistent with the adopted calendar of meeting and filing dates. 
iii.  The appealing party is required to provide public notice for the meeting, consistent with the provisions of section 17.48.020. 
iv.  The board of zoning appeals shall consider the provisions of section 17.48.030 and all other documented, applicable standards in deciding the appeal. 
C.  Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying district(s) are permitted in the Downtown Overlay Zoning District. All uses that are special exceptions in the underlying district(s) are special exceptions in the Downtown Overlay Zoning District. 
D.  Background. The downtown core of Franklin is characterized by historic structures that are predominately late Victorian Italianate and Beaux Arts style of the late 19th and 20th centuries circa 1880 to 1930. This is exemplified by the structures along Jefferson Street running from Walnut east to Home Street on the north side of the street. These structures are typically two to three stories in height and consist of a lower storefront predominately of clear glass and columns or large windows, an upper floor with punched masonry windows and an ornamental cornice at the top of the building. The proportions of the façades are based largely on an eighteen- to twenty-foot-wide storefront bay repeated multiple times where the buildings are larger and repeated only once where they are of a single bay width. The façades are primarily constructed of glass, cast iron, brick masonry, brick and stone masonry, ornamental metal, and in some cases wood trim. The historic windows in the upper façades are largely double hung windows with either one over one or two over two panes. An eighteen- to twenty-foot width is established on the façades that run vertically through the building. The buildings are organized by six to eight foot bay lines running vertically through the building consisting of columns, windows and pilaster elements creating the vertical width and ordering of the façade. 

General Requirements 
1.  Façade Retention and Restoration. The building façades on a street provide the visual image of the downtown. Because they are composed of similar parts, their appearance should be organized and coordinated. Over the years, however, maintaining this appearance has been a challenge. Due to technological developments, changing tenants, and different merchandising trends, a storefront will go through multiple design changes over time. The upper façade, often viewed as less important, tends to have been ignored or even covered over. Because building appearance is an essential ingredient of a successful downtown, owners are encouraged to restore and maintain their building facades in the original, intended manner. 
    The primary façades of all historic structures (Outstanding, Notable or Contributing by the Johnson County Interim Inventory Report, published by Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, 1985) should have all defining features of the overall historical character retained. In the case where these defining features no longer exist, have been torn down, or covered up, these features should be restored if and when restoration or remodeling takes place in the particular area of the feature. Where documentation of the original is not accessible, all work on a façade should comply with the standards for new development in subsection 12. Changes that have no historical basis or seek to create an earlier appearance should be avoided. 
    The façade of the typical downtown building is made up of three parts: the storefront with entrance and display windows, the upper façade, and the cornice that caps the building. Within these three parts are the details that give a façade its character, including the bulkheads, transom, storefront cornice, windows, and window hoods (see Figure 2). 

When planning a façade renovation, consult the following standards, as well as the standards relating to specific elements found later in these standards. 
A.  Façade Retention. All historic buildings should be preserved. In the case of commercial buildings where the area of the building behind the façade is in severely deteriorated condition, all primary façades should be retained and new construction may be infilled behind the façade. 
a.  Original features, historic elements, and examples of craftsmanship should be retained wherever possible. The removal of distinguishing features or significant architectural details should be avoided. Previously made changes that have achieved architectural or design significance should be retained. 
b.  Exception. In the case where an accessory structure is so severely deteriorated that it is an unsafe structure, the accessory structure may be razed. This exception should not be construed as permitting the demolition of an accessory structure by means of purposely causing or allowing it to fall into disrepair. 
B.  Façade Restoration. The following standards apply to the repair or restoration of any façade or façade feature. 
a.  Historic buildings should retain all architectural elements such as windows, cornices, porches, roof lines, eaves, entry ways, and façade materials. Deteriorated architectural elements on any historic building should be repaired or replaced. Where an architectural element has been previously removed or the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a feature, the new feature should match the original in size, scale, and architectural style, and where possible, materials. Synthetic materials may be used in the case where original materials are not available. 
b.  Nonhistoric buildings which contain architectural elements similar to those on surrounding historic buildings should retain those elements by repairing or replacing those elements. It is recommended that those elements be repaired rather than replaced. If those elements are being replaced, they should match the original in size, scale, and architectural style. Those elements should not be removed without being replaced. 

c.  Where any architectural element on a primary façade or other highly visible location is being replaced, the replacement feature should match identically any parts, portions, or pieces of remaining similar architectural elements in size, scale, style, design, color, and where possible, materials. 
d.  Where the replacement of an architectural element is limited to the secondary façade and is not highly visible, the replacement feature shall be consistent with architectural style of the building and should not clash with the overall architecture of the building or any individual architectural details. 
e.  Chemical or physical treatments that cause damage to historic building materials should not be used. The surface cleaning of structures should be undertaken using the gentlest means possible in order to preserve the building materials. 
f.  Infilling, enclosing, covering, or removing of any original windows, doors, storefronts, porches, display windows or other architectural details is prohibited. 
g.  Shutters, if utilized, should be sized to appear as though they could work. However, shutters were seldom used on 19th and 20th century buildings. 
h.  Awnings should be of a proportion and color to complement the existing colors of the building. 
i.  Accessibility modifications should be made at side or rear entrances to maintain façade integrity. 
    The following are the defining primary façade features which should be retained or restored. This should not be construed as preventing the ordinary maintenance and repair of a façade. 
a.  Kick plates at the base of storefront display windows; 
b.  Clear glass, which does not produce excess amounts of glare for all first story windows and glazing; 
c.  Original recessed entrance areas, angled vestibules, spaces, or corners; 
d.  Transoms above doors and windows; 
e.  Clearstory portions of the façade; 
f.  Signage bands including relevant ornamentation; 
g.  Original window styles including opening size and location, sashes, mullions, muntins, sills, and heads; 
h.  Decorative columns, pilasters of cast iron, brick or stone; 
i.  Cornices; 
j.  Parapet walls. 
    The following additional requirements also apply to all facades: 
a.  In the case where a building was originally built in such a way that it would not meet the standards of this chapter and the façade does not contribute to the overall character of the Downtown Overlay District, any remodeling of such building's facades should follow the standards for new development. This should not be interpreted as being required during ordinary maintenance and repair. 
b.  No HVAC, mechanical or other equipment should be placed on or attached to the primary façade. Additionally, equipment should be concealed from view from any public street. 
c.  First floor display windows should allow visibility from any pedestrian walkway into the business or contain a display of products, art, or other creative display, which is oriented towards and facing the sidewalk and is a minimum of eighteen (18) inches deep. No obstruction of view such as paper or plywood coverings or interior facing display case is permitted within eighteen (18) inches of the interior of the glazing except during active construction for which all required certificates, permits, and approvals have been obtained. 
d.  Windows on secondary façade or upper stories should not be covered from the inside with coverings such as paper or plywood. If the space behind the window is vacant, it is recommended that the window contain blinds or curtains if blocking of the window is so desired. 
e.  The use of the following inappropriate materials should not be used: 
i.  Coarsely finished rustic material such as wood shake shingles, barn boards, plywood and wood siding. 
ii.  Carpeting. 
iii.  Expanded or perforated metals, industrial metal siding, wire mesh, or corrugated metal or fiberglass. 
iv.  Inappropriate ornate ironwork such as New Orleans style grills and rail work. 
v.  Stucco surfaces with rustic or highly textured surfaces characteristic of Mediterranean or Southwestern styles. 
vi.  Antique appearing, synthetic, oversized, or variegated brick. 
vii.  Silver, gold or clear anodized bright metal including aluminum or stainless steel trim for windows and doors. 
viii.  Residential type materials such as embossed entry doors, sliding patio doors and residential beveled and leaded stained glass doors. 
ix.  Flat or molded plastic sheeting used to simulate historic materials, stone, or masonry veneers. 
x.  Rustic field stone or rustic rock masonry work 
xi.  Flush glazing treatments, glass block windows, or mirrored, highly tinted, colored, metalized, or reflective glass. 
2.  Window Restoration and Replacement. Windows play an important visual role in the downtown. Display windows provide merchants with an area to display their wares. The upper story windows establish the pattern that helps tie together the façades of a block. Transom windows provide light and ventilation to the inside of the building. Window style and decoration has changed through the years (see Figure 3). However, proper care and maintenance of all storefront windows remain key to an attractive building. 

    Display Windows. The display window is a crucial element in the success of a downtown business. An attractive, well-planned display can be the difference between someone merely walking by or actually coming in to shop. After setting up your window display, be sure to view the display from outside, to gain the same perspective as customers and passers-by. Also, be careful with all window signage. While a display window can provide space for an attractive painted sign, you should not cover excessive amounts of any window with signage. 
    Upper Story Windows. Upper story windows are often neglected, inappropriately replaced, or even boarded up. Not only does this impact the appearance of the building, it can change the character of a block. If your building has upper story windows, be sure to set up a regular maintenance schedule. This will help prevent further deterioration. 
    Transom Windows. Transom windows, located at the top of the storefront opening, are a source of natural light and ventilation. For energy conservation, these windows were often covered or removed. Covering or painting over transom windows upsets the design relationship of the façade and destroys the rhythm of repeating patterns on the street. Uncovering and restoring transom windows is encouraged. 
    Windows on historic buildings are the most important elements in defining its architectural character and significance. Their original materials and features should be respected and retained. Repairing historic windows has become easier with the introduction of new materials and techniques. The following standards apply to the restoration or replacement of windows. 
A.  Window Repair. The most common window problems involve damaged or deteriorated wood, faulty window operation, and broken glass panes. Many problems can be easily repaired at a minimum cost. 
a.  Deteriorated wood is often found on the sill or bottom of the sash. These parts can be replaced without replacing the whole window. Local building supply stores may have pieces that match the original window. Minor repairs can be made by scraping off old paint, filling in cracks with putty or caulk, sanding, priming and applying a fresh coat of paint. 
b.  A window that isn't operating like it used to should be addressed. It could be that the window is painted shut. This can be corrected by tapping the sash with a hammer wrapped in cloth. Another problem could be with the window mechanism (sash locks, cords, and weights). If this is the case, contact a window dealer who can offer assistance without changing the window. Franklin Heritage can recommend contractors who have experience with this type of work. 
c.  Broken glass panes can be easily fixed by removing all old glass and glazing putty, and installing a new pane using the appropriate glazier's points and putty. 
d.  Be sure to check all joints between a window and its masonry opening. If loose or open joints exist, caulk to prevent air and water filtration. 
e.  Window trim, cornices, sills, and decorative window caps or other details should be replaced and installed on historic buildings only if they originally existed. In the case of nonhistoric buildings, these window elements may be added only where they fit the architectural style of the building. Enhancing windows with superfluous nonhistoric or architecturally inaccurate details is not permitted. 
f.  Creating new window openings or eliminating original window openings that significantly alter the character of the elevations is prohibited. 
g.  Reestablishing original window openings that have been reduced or completely closed is encouraged. New windows used to reestablish the original openings need to follow the standards for window replacement. 
B.  Window Replacement. Sometimes repairs may be impractical and the only option available is replacement. If you're replacing only one window, find a replacement that matches the existing units. If you cannot find a suitable replacement, consider having one custom made. Wood is the preferred choice, however if you must use aluminum or vinyl, a darker color is preferred. Do not alter the existing window opening to fit new windows and do not install windows that are not in keeping with the style of your building (See Figure 4). 

C.  Storm Windows. Installing storm windows is a great way to cut down on your energy costs. The downside is that they often look inappropriate on an older building façade. If possible, consider installing storm windows on the inside so they will not be seen. If they must be installed on the outside, make sure they are the same shape and have the same overall design features as other outside windows. An anodized or baked-on finish is more desirable than plain aluminum. 

3.  Masonry Repair and Restoration. Regular maintenance is the most efficient and economical way to keep your building looking its best. As a general rule, you should treat any historic detail with care. First and foremost, maintain what you have. If necessary, repair or replace the detail, duplicating or complimenting the original. The following tips will assist you in identifying and addressing potential problems. 
Every effort should be made to retain the historic masonry façades in their original design, shape and architectural appearance including all relevant detailing, and ornamentation. For the purposes of this section, masonry includes stone, brick, architectural terra cotta, cast stone, concrete, and concrete block. Typically masonry deterioration and damage has been caused by neglect or deferred maintenance due to water infiltration, horizontal and vertical movement of the masonry due to disengagement from the structural frame, vertical settlement, or horizontal movement due to expansion and contraction. Extreme care is required for any masonry repair to prevent an obvious unsightly patch. 
    Moisture. Brick and stone are durable but they can deteriorate over time. Most often, water infiltration is responsible. Moisture can enter through the top of a wall or where the wall meets the roof. Check your roof, flashing, and wall copings periodically for soundness. Gutters and downspouts should also be inspected periodically for leakage. 
A.  Tuckpointing. The mortar used in older masonry buildings gradually erodes as water runs over the wall surface and with freeze/thaw cycles. Joints should be inspected periodically for crumbling or missing mortar. If mortar joints have recessed more than two inches, they should be repointed with new mortar to prevent water infiltration and ensure the integrity of the wall. New mortar joints should match the original in style, size, composition, and color. It is especially important to repoint with mortar of the same hardness as the original. The softer historic mortar compresses as the bricks expand in warm weather and flexes as they contract in cold weather. It is by design, the sacrificial element of the wall and gradual erosion is to be expected. Harder modern mortars with a high content of Portland cement will resist the warm weather expansion of the brick, which can cause cracks in the brick surface. In the cold weather, this same inflexibility may cause cracks to open up as the historic bricks contract. 
B.  Cleaning. Masonry cleaning can have a huge impact on the appearance of a building. Most historic masonry buildings have never been cleaned, and accumulated dirt can obscure the original masonry color. Masonry should always be cleaned by the gentlest method possible. In many cases low pressure water washing (no more than two hundred fifty (250) psi), together with scrubbing with a natural bristle brush may be sufficient. If paint or heavy grime must be removed, a chemical cleaner may be required. There are a variety of chemical cleaners available and a qualified cleaning contractor should be consulted to evaluate your building and recommend a treatment. Whatever treatment is selected, a test patch should first be tried in an inconspicuous area and allowed to weather for a few weeks or months. If the results of the test are satisfactory and no damage is observed, it should be safe to proceed. Remember to protect nearby trees, shrubs, and groundcover when cleaning your building. Chemical cleaners may be hazardous to vegetation. The following treatments are appropriate and should be used during all cleaning, repairing, and restoring of masonry: 
a.  Cleaning masonry with the least abrasive method possible. 
b.  Using test patches in inconspicuous areas on secondary elevations to determine the appropriate means of cleaning. 
c.  Addressing and correcting the underlying cause of damage to masonry before any repair or repointing is undertaken. 
d.  Mortar joints should be cleaned out and loose mortar removed to appropriate depth, usually one to one, replacing typically all mortar on historic buildings with a high lime content. 
e.  All mortar should be carefully removed so as to not damage any of the edges of masonry surfaces. 
f.  All replacement masonry should match the existing whether it is salvaged or new material and reused material should be closely matched in terms of size, color and texture. 
g.  Painted masonry structures should be permitted to retain painted surfaces after appropriate cleaning and removing of loose paint and debris. 
C.  Inappropriate Masonry Treatments. The following treatments are discouraged for all cleaning, repairing, and restoring of masonry: 
a.  You should not use abrasive treatments (sand blasting or high pressure washing) to clean masonry surfaces. 
b.  Replacing bricks and brick masonry unless it is excessively spalled or cracked. Instead the same bricks should be reused if possible by cleaning and reversing their faces. Use of contemporary new brick that is "antique in appearance" with a wide range of color is discouraged. Brickwork, particularly on historic buildings, is usually uniform in character. 
c.  Covering of historic masonry surfaces with any type of siding, metal or synthetic sidings, stucco, exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) or ceramic or fiberglass veneers. 
d.  Using any kind of power grinding to remove masonry or to remove mortar or to alter masonry. 
e.  Sandblasting should not be done on historic structures unless where otherwise specifically allowed. Sandblasting is especially harmful to brick surfaces, eroding the hard outer layer to expose a softer, more porous surface that will weather rapidly. You should be aware that sandblasting will disqualify a project from consideration when applying for state and federal tax credits. 
f.  Exposed masonry should never be painted. A previously painted surface can be restored by a chemical paint remover. Previously painted structures should, in all probability, be retained as such because removing paint can result in detrimental effects to the underlying masonry surfaces. 
g.  Waterproofing, repellants or sealers used on any masonry surface. These materials can potentially cause serious damage by trapping moisture in masonry, which would cause deterioration in the future. If used, it is essential to allow breathing of the surfaces on which they are applied 
h.  Abrasive methods for paint removal to expose original brick. 


4.  Wood Maintenance. Storefronts, cornice brackets and other decorative façade elements were often made of wood. These original exterior woodwork elements should be retained wherever possible. Regular maintenance will prevent deterioration. Check periodically for soft, rotted areas, splits, and dampness. Damage or decayed sections can usually be repaired by re-nailing, caulking, and filling. Epoxy pastes and epoxy consolidants can also be very effective in repairing even seriously rotted wood. When painting, use an oil-based primer followed by two coats of oil-based paints. 
Severely rotted or missing pieces may be reproduced by a good carpenter or millwork shop. Try to match or at least complement the existing details when replacing woodwork. 

5.  Metal Maintenance. Many of the buildings in the historic core of Franklin are defined by the cast iron and ornamental metal elements that form the storefronts at the pedestrian level. These elements are principal defining features of the façades and should be retained and restored through every possible effort. The lower display window kick fronts support columns, window mullions, and decorative elements of the transom and sign bands are typically made of these materials. Stamped or pressed metal was most often used to create decorative metal cornices. This kind of architectural ornamentation became quite popular because intricate detail could be reproduced at a reasonable cost. 
    The signs of metal deterioration are obvious: corrosion, tears, holes and missing pieces. Pressed or stamped metal may be of copper, which requires no surface protection, or of sheet iron, usually coated with zinc or lead to retard rusting. A proper coat of paint is essential to prevent rust and corrosion on such metals. Missing parts can be reproduced in fiberglass or aluminum using existing pieces to make a mold. Be sure to communicate to the person fabricating the replacement part the importance of maintaining the intricate decoration of such pieces. 
    Appropriate Cleaning and Repair. Strip and clean off old paint and rust using appropriate chemical strippers and non-abrasive power washing and light sandblasting. Extreme caution should be taken with rolled sheet metal surfaces so as to not damage them if any of the power washing or light nonabrasive power blasting methods are used. 
6.  Decorative Glass Maintenance. Beveled, stained, leaded and etched glass are all forms of decorative glass. Glass decoration is often covered up. Look for it in transoms or behind plywood window covers. Sagging means that the glass and frame will need to be reinforced with a brace. Leaded or stained glass can have problems. The metal between the glass pieces, called the "came," could either be zinc or lead. You should always use the same metal when making repairs. 
7.  Color Guidelines and Recommendations. Choosing the right color combination for a building can unify the elements of the façade and relate the building to others on the block. Again, step outside and look at your building as it relates to others. Make sure the colors you use are in character with the rest of the buildings on the block. Generally, no more than three colors are sufficient for a building façade. Paint manufacturers have a large selection of historic colors available and can assist with an appropriate color scheme. Stay away from bold colors that attract undo attention to the property. The use of fluorescent, metallic, reflective, or glittery colors for exterior walls, trim or other architectural features is prohibited. 
    Background. Muted or natural tones are appropriate for the background of the building. The background consists of the upper wall and the piers on either side of the storefront. This color is often natural brick and requires no painting. In fact, painting of brick surfaces is strongly discouraged and discussed in subsection 3. Masonry Repair and Restoration. 
    Major Trim. The color of major trim elements such as cornices, window frames, sills and hoods, and the storefront frame, bulkhead and columns should complement the background color. 
    Secondary Trim. Secondary trim such as the window sashes, doors, and certain cornice and bulkhead details should enhance the color scheme established by the background and major trim. A darker shade of the major trim is often used to highlight these features. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the façade is not over-decorated. 
    In general, color schemes should be selected that are appropriate to the building's style and period. Using a 1950s color scheme on a Victorian building is inappropriate. The color schemes should be developed to enhance the character-defining elements of the architecture and to complement and relate to its neighbors in the downtown core. Different color schemes were popular at various times. In the mid 1800s, soft, neutral tints were common. Toward the end of the 19th century, darker, richer shades were used. Tastes changed again at the beginning of the 1900s to lighter, calmer colors. If you are thinking about returning your building to its original colors, carefully scrape the paint from a small area. There may be several layers of paint over the original color. It's possible that the original color may have changed over time. For a better idea of the true color, wet the original surface. The base color will appear more accurately when wet. It is not necessary that colors be researched and analyzed to document original authenticity. As noted in the masonry repair section, previously painted structures should, in all probability, be retained as such because removing paint can result in detrimental effects to the underlying masonry surfaces. 
    The sun will play an important role in the colors you select. Before deciding on a color, take a paint chip outside to see how it looks. Do this at various times throughout the day, and also on both sunny and cloudy days. Sometimes a small paint chip is not enough to get a good idea of how a color will look. In that case, invest in a quart of the color you choose and apply it to a small area on your building. The effect may be surprising. 
    Next Steps. Painting your building can provide a dramatic improvement in your building's appearance for a relatively low cost. After deciding on the appropriate colors, however, your work has just begun. There are several steps you should follow to ensure your new paint job will be long lasting and successful. 
1.  Type of Paint. Should you use oil-based or latex paint? Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Oil-based paints are generally more durable, and may provide better adherence. Cleanup is more difficult. Latex paints are easier to apply and cleanup is simple. However, latex paint can be less durable than oil-based. Whichever you choose, select a quality paint. Although you'll pay more, a quality paint will last longer than a cheaper paint, will not fade or peel as quickly, and gives better coverage. It is important to note that once you use a certain type of paint for your building, you should continue to use the same type of paint. Switching back and forth between oil and latex is difficult. 
2.  General Preparation. There are many things you can do to prep your building for painting. Check the condition of any wood and replace any boards that are rotted. If you are painting a masonry building, check the condition of the mortar and tuck-point where necessary. Review the condition of your windows. Install new glass in all broken windows. Replace damaged putty with a glazing compound and make sure it goes all around the windows. You'll need to wait two to three days for the compound to dry before you can paint. 
3.  Surface Preparation. Prior to painting, all surfaces should be adequately prepared. All loose or peeling paint must be removed. Wire brushes and scrapers are the best tools to use. If these do not work, consider a blow torch or electric heat gun. Use caution with these last two devices, with only enough heat to soften the paint so it can be easily pushed away. Consider using a primer for the first coat, especially on older buildings. It will help the final coat adhere better. 
    Other Considerations. 
1.  Colored mortars should not be employed to alter the coloration of historic structures. 
2.  Natural colors of brick, terra cotta, fired clay stones, masonry, limestone, granite, sandstone or other natural materials should be retained and should not be painted over unless it is consistent with the historic precedent. 
3.  Architectural metals such as copper, bronze and brass should not be painted. 

8.  Doors. Traditionally, downtown buildings had three doors. On the building front, there was storefront door, providing access to the business, and a secondary door, providing access to the upper floors (see Figure 5). The rear door was primarily used as a service door. 

    Storefront Door. Historically the entry to a store was more than just a door. The design and appearance reflected its commercial importance. The traditional storefront door was substantial, built of wood with a large glass panel. Despite its stately proportion, the door was inviting to a customer. Although traditional storefront doors are rarely found these days, there are several things that can be done to make a front door the special, inviting element it should be. 
1.  A front door should be compatible with the rest of the storefront and make a significant statement. 
2.  To retain a traditional appearance, a wood door with a tall glass panel is most appropriate to maintain the original character. Try to locate a salvaged older door to repair or use a new door of similar design. 
3.  If a traditional appearance is not desired, the design choice should be based on the overall design of the storefront. Many different wood and metal styles are available. If a glass and aluminum door is chosen, consider using a dark, anodized finish rather than a metallic color. 
4.  Avoid over-decorating the door. The design should reinforce the character of the building and be inviting for shoppers. 
    Secondary Door. A secondary door on the front façade provides access to the upper floors and is usually less elaborate in design. When choosing a secondary door, keep in mind that it should be visually understated, fitting in with the overall façade, but not drawing attention to itself. To maintain a traditional appearance, an old wood panel door is most appropriate. 
    Rear Door. A practical style is recommended for a rear door to reflect the unadorned character of the rear façade. If the back door will be used as a customer entrance, consider the addition of glass to the door to make it more inviting to shoppers and passers-by. 
9.  Awnings. Awnings can be both a decorative and functional addition to a storefront. Visually, an awning can add character and interest to a storefront. Practically, an awning provides a sheltered space for customers to view store window displays, and can provide energy saving benefits, especially when used on southern facing windows. When planning an awning for your building, the following should be considered: 

    Design. The design of an awning determines how energy efficient it will be. There are two types of awnings available, fixed and operable. An operable awning can be opened and closed, allowing sun to shine in on cold days and providing shade on warm sunny days. A fixed awning is primarily decorative. 
    Style. Awnings should be integrated into the design of the building façade, with simple pitch and profile that matches the building bay structure. Awnings along a street should have a consistent pattern in size and shape, and not conflict with others. Look at your neighbors' buildings and visualize how adding an awning will affect the character of the streetscape (see Figure 6). 
    Material. Awnings can be constructed from several different materials, including canvas, vinyl, and aluminum. Whichever material is chosen, make sure it is guaranteed weather-resistant. Fading or bleaching from the sun is also an important consideration. 
A.  Canvas awnings are traditionally popular, but must be weather-treated before installation. Canvas has a lower initial cost, but may require more maintenance than plastic or aluminum. 
B.  Vinyl (plastic) has a more contemporary effect, but can be attractive if done correctly. Vinyl is more flexible and usually requires less maintenance than fabric. 
C.  Aluminum is another choice but is more residential in character and not generally appropriate in the downtown area. 
    Mounting. Awnings should be mounted so that the valence is approximately eight feet above the sidewalk. A twelve-inch valence flap is usually attached at the awning bar and can serve as a sign panel. Typically, an awning will project between four and seven feet from the building. An awning can be attached above the display windows and below the sign panel or cornice. It can also be mounted between the transom and the display window, which allows light into the store while shading the merchandise for customers. An awning over upper-story windows should not cover the piers or the space between the window sills and the storefront cornice. If an awning has support posts that are permanently affixed to the sidewalk, approval from the board of works is required before installation. Contact the mayor's office to make the request. 
    Color. Look at the entire building before deciding on a color for your awning. You'll want a color that enhances the existing features without overwhelming them. For buildings with more detail, a subtle shade should be used. For buildings with minimal architectural detailing, a bright accent color may enhance the façade. Pattern is important too, depending on the image you would like to project. 
    Signs. The valence of an awning has traditionally been used for advertising. If you choose to incorporate a sign on an awning, keep the message simple and for identification purposes only (see Figure 7). 
    Illumination: Internally illuminated or back-lit awnings are highly discouraged and not recommended. 

10.  Signage Treatments. All signs must conform to article 8 [chapter 17.36] Sign Standards. In addition the following standards apply to all signs in the Downtown Overlay Zoning District. 
    Signs are a vital part of any downtown. They call attention to your business and help attract customers. Additionally, signs help shape the image of downtown. The following questions are provided to help you determine the right signage for your business and the downtown: 

    What is the Purpose of My Sign? Do you merely want to identify the name of your business? Or should you provide information on the products you sell or services you offer? Who are you trying to attract? Take some time to consider what you want your sign to do. 
    What Type of Message Should I Use? Can you convey your message with words? Or will a logo or symbol be more recognizable to potential customers? Possibly, a combination of words and symbols is appropriate. Sign lettering should have a high contrast ratio in order to be clearly legible for vehicular traffic. Sign lettering on wall signs, awning signs, or projecting signs needs to be a minimum of four inches in height so as to be clearly legible for vehicular traffic. 
    What Style Sign Should I Use? For most downtown businesses, wall, window, projecting, or canopy signs are the only types of signs that can be used. For new development or redeveloped sites, a freestanding sign is a possibility with special approval from the board of zoning appeals. If you want to use a freestanding sign, consider a monument style sign to maintain the pedestrian scale of the downtown. Taller pole signs are inappropriate and should be avoided. 

    Where Should I Put My Sign? When considering sign placement, you need to visualize how your sign will appear in relation to the entire façade. A sign should not dominate the façade. Its shape and proportions should fit the building just as a door or window fits. The most common location for a wall sign is just below the lower cornice. This location compliments the architecture of the building and presents a strong image. Other common locations include on the glass display window and on the awning flap (see Figure 8). A good resource to consult is a picture of how your building looked in the past. This may give you ideas about how signs were related to the details of your building. Signs should never project above the upper cornice line or be mounted on the roof of a building. Never cover up architectural details. Horizontal projecting signs have a width which is longer than the height of the sign. Horizontal projecting signs should project no more than four feet from the building and be no more than twelve (12) square feet in sign area. In addition, horizontal projecting signs should generally be located between the transom line of the first floor and the lower half of the windows of the second floor. Vertical projecting signs have a height which is longer than the width of the sign. Vertical projecting signs project no more than three feet from the building and do not exceed thirty (30) square feet in sign area. In addition, vertical projecting signs should be located above the first floor or sign band whichever is higher. 
    Should I Illuminate My Sign? Illuminating a sign may be desirable. Individual back-lit letters and signs illuminated by wall-mounted fixtures are appropriate. Illuminated box signs, flashing signs, moving signs, and electronic or fixed letter reader boards are not permitted. 

    Materials. Appropriate sign materials include painted or carved wood, galvanized sheet metal or aluminum, stone materials consisting of marble, slate or sandstone veneer, granite or granite veneer, gold leaf, gilt, painted accents, sandblasted glass or metal, stained glass, clear or acrylic neon. While the use of neon can create an attractive sign, neon should not be used to outline or trim a building or the architectural elements. 
11.  Lighting. Lighting is an important element when considering visibility in the evening hours. Generally, street lighting installed by the city will provide adequate lighting of the overall building and sidewalk. However, there are times when you may want to provide additional illumination to your building. 
    Lighting should only be used to illuminate entries, signage, displays, adjacent pedestrian and parking areas, or to highlight significant architectural elements. Use fixtures with a traditional style, or contemporary fixtures that are appropriately scaled. Building mounted fixtures should be used to illuminate entries, wall mounted signs, and walkways adjacent to buildings. Fixture color should be muted and coordinate with the overall color scheme of the building. Exposed or painted metal finishes are recommended. 
    To attract attention to your storefront area, there are some traditional methods of lighting you can use: 
 Well-lit display windows attract attention to items in your window. 
 Residual light washed the sidewalk and attracts pedestrians. 
 Light over recessed entry doors can highlight your entrance. 
 Lighted signs in the window (neon is acceptable) can highlight products and services. 
12.  New Development. Construction of new buildings on vacant lots in the downtown is encouraged. The design and location of such buildings, however, requires special care. Two types of new construction are discussed: Infill development, where new construction fills in gaps in the existing street façade, and standard development, where new construction is on parcels located in lesser dense areas of the downtown. In order to retain the historic context and character, new buildings should reflect the character of existing historic buildings by relating to the massing, scale, articulation, and rhythm of Franklin's historic architecture. 
    Infill Development. The design of new infill development, especially the front façade, is critical. The new façade must look appropriate in relation to the surrounding buildings, without replicating them. When designing a new infill building, particular attention should be paid to the following: 

A.  Building Design. The design of new infill buildings should be harmonious with its surroundings. Architectural style is not restricted, however, extremes of styles, or attempts to recreation a style indigenous to the downtown are discouraged. 
B.  Building Setback. A new infill building should maintain the line of existing storefronts at the sidewalk edge. Creating gaps in the streetscape by setting the building too far back from its neighbors or by placing off-street parking in front of a building is not permitted (see Figure 9). 
C.  Building Scaling and Massing. When designing a new infill building, the scale (height and width) and mass of existing buildings along the street should be respected. The average height and width of nearby buildings can be used to determine a general set of proportions for an infill structure or the bays of a larger structure. The infill building should fill the entire void, or, if the site is large, the mass of the façade can be divided into two or more smaller bays to maintain the established rhythm of the block (see Figure 10). Primary facades should have vertical articulation a minimum of every twenty (20) feet. There should be a minimum of two windows per upper story between required vertical articulations. A vertical articulation may be implemented by using one or more of the following techniques: a structural or expressed column, a distinctive change in coloration, a slightly varied façade position, or distinctive change in overall style of architectural elements. 
D.  Buildings should meet the ground with a solid base treatment to create a visual transition from the sidewalk to the building wall. Glass treatments that extend to the ground are not recommended. Upper stories should not be set back from the first story primary façade. 

E.  Roof Forms. The type of roof used for an infill building should be similar to those found on adjacent buildings. In general, flat roofs are preferred over gable, gambrel, hop, or mansard roofs. A parapet should be used to conceal a flat roof and any roof protrusions other than the chimney. 
F.  Openings. Doors and windows on an infill building should be similar in size, proportion, and alignment based on the architectural style of the building, and to those on adjacent facades. The rhythm of structural mass to voids (doors, windows, etc.) should relate to rhythms established on adjacent buildings (see Figure 11). 

G.  Detailing. Details from adjacent buildings, such as the masonry work, cornice lines, window shapes and bulkheads, should be reflected in the architecture of infill buildings. 
H.  Building Materials. Materials used in the construction of infill buildings should be similar to that used on adjacent buildings. A new building should not stand out from other buildings on the block. Brick and wood are preferred materials. The following is a list of materials that are not considered appropriate: 
a.  Aluminum siding. 
b.  Aluminum panels. 
c.  Coarsely finished rustic material such as wood shake shingles, barn boards, and plywood. 
d.  Mirrors or reflective glass. 
e.  Carpeting. 
f.  Stucco surfaces with rustic or highly textured surfaces characteristic of Mediterranean or Southwestern styles. 
g.  Antique appearing, synthetic, oversized, or variegated brick. 
h.  Corrugated fiberglass and metal. 
i.  Residential type materials such as embossed entry doors, sliding patio doors and residential beveled and leaded stained glass doors. 
j.  Flat or molded plastic sheeting used to simulate historic materials, stone, or masonry veneers. 
k.  Rustic field stone or rustic rock masonry work. 
l.  Flush glazing treatments, glass block windows, or mirrored, highly tinted, colored, metalized, or reflective glass. 
    Aluminum, steel, or vinyl cased wood windows may be used, but should have an appropriate finish and color consistent with the overall color scheme. 
I.  Details from adjacent buildings, such as the masonry work, cornice lines, window shapes and bulkheads should be reflected in the architecture of infill buildings. 
J.  On-Site Parking: On-site parking should be confined to the rear of structures and should be screened from public view per the Landscape Standards in Article 7. 
K.  Height Requirements. Buildings should be a minimum of two stories of habitable floor space. Any building facing the courthouse square should be no more than three stories and should be no taller than the height of the upper cornice line of the courthouse. Any building not facing the courthouse square should follow the maximum height as specified in the base zoning district. 
a.  Exception. In the case of freestanding institutional buildings such as churches, schools, or government buildings which do not face the immediate courthouse square, the planning director may exempt the development from certain requirements of this section where those requirements specifically contradict the traditional architectural style for that type of institutional building; e.g. a church would not be required to have first floor display windows, but vertical articulation and vertically oriented windows would still be appropriate. 
b.  Exception. In detached buildings away from the courthouse square, the building may have only one habitable story as long as the minimum height of façade walls is twenty (20) feet. 
L.  Miscellaneous: 
a.  Floor Level. The floor level of an infill building should relate to and be consistent with the floor levels of adjacent buildings. 


13.  Residential Type Structures. The following applies to all residentially designed structures in addition to the general requirements of this chapter. Any one- or two-dwelling-unit structures as a primary use located in the Downtown Overlay Design Standards Zoning District shall be exempt from these design standards. 
1.  Residential Façade Design Standards. The following applies to the restoration of residential primary and accessory structures in addition to the general requirement for facades. 
a.  General. All work shall follow the general requirements of subsection 1. for façade retention and restoration. 
b.  Windows. All work on windows shall follow the general requirements of subsection 2. for window restoration and replacement. 
c.  Masonry. All masonry work shall follow the general requirements of subsection 3. for masonry repair and restoration. 
d.  Retention of Entrances. Primary building entrances should maintain historic stoops, terraces and relationship to grade so as to maintain the character of the historic façades. Handicap-accessible entries may be located on a secondary façade so as to not obstruct the primary front yard elements. 
e.  Alterations. Any exterior alterations or remodeling shall follow the standards for new residential development under subsection 10.3 New Residential. 
2.  Additions. The following shall apply to additions of residential buildings. 
a.  They should be substantially similar to the primary structure in terms of building materials, trim detail, roof lines, window and door styles, and other prominent details. 
b.  They should match the primary structure in terms of coloration of siding, trim, and other details. 
c.  They should not include architectural styles and details from a period different than the existing primary structure. 
d.  They should be no taller than the existing primary structure. 
3.  New Residential. The following applies to all new residential buildings including accessory structures. New infill structures should visually relate to the character and scale of the adjacent structures in the immediate block in which they are located. 
a.  ROOFS. 
i.  Roof pitch should reflect the architectural character of the home, and may be either gable, hipped, or a combination. 
ii.  Eave lines should align wherever possible. Eaves and rakes should be articulated by multiple fascia boards, cove and crown molds, or gutters. 
iii.  Eave overhang should be minimum sixteen inches (16") from exterior face of structural framing. 
iv.  Overhang of gable should be a minimum of twelve inches (12"). 
v.  The following roofing materials are permitted: wood shingle, slate, tile and asphalt shingle. 
vi.  Boxed in eave lines are not permitted. 
b.  WINDOWS. The following applies to all windows on primary façades and windows which are highly visible from a public street. 
i.  All windows should be double-hung in appearance (except transoms). Single-hung windows with a lower operable sash and fixed, nonoperable windows are acceptable provided they have a double hung appearance. 
ii.  Casement windows may be used where the paneling adds to and is consistent with the architectural style of the house. 
iii.  Preferred window types include all wood, vinyl-clad wood, or aluminum-clad wood. All-vinyl windows may be utilized, provided they have an acceptable profile. Window types should be called out on plans. 
iv.  If all-vinyl windows are used, windows should have painted wood trim consistent with item v. below, consistent with the architectural style of the home. 
c.  SHUTTERS. 
i.  Shutters will be permitted on homes only if they are appropriate to the architectural style of the home. 
ii.  Shutters should function or appear to be functional by matching the size and shape of the shutters to the window. They should include decorative hinges or be placed such that the shutters could pivot so as to be functional. 
d.  EXTERIOR DOORS AND TRIM. 
i.  Door trim should match exterior window trim treatment. Wood trim around doors is required when wood trim is used on windows. 
ii.  Storm doors are acceptable provided that they are full-light doors with clear glass so the primary door is visible and all trim on the storm door is painted to match the home colors. 
iii.  Sliding glass doors are not acceptable along a primary façade of the home. 
e.  SIDING AND DECORATIVE TRIM. 
i.  Brick, wood, or cement-fiber are preferred exterior materials. 
ii.  Natural stone may also be permitted. 
iii.  Vinyl siding may be utilized and should be a flat color, not shiny. 
iv.  No Dutch lap vinyl siding will be permitted, as all vinyl siding should be either double-four or triple-three type. Vinyl siding with a brush-stroke finish in lieu of a wood-grained texture is acceptable. 
v.  Horizontal siding should have a maximum six-inch reveal. 
vi.  Mixing of material types is restricted to fishscale or shake decorative siding at second floor transition and in gables in conjunction with horizontal siding. 
vii.  Trim boards, corner and frieze boards should be built out with filler boards to allow siding to be tucked behind trim board. Corner trim boards should be a minimum of three and one-half inches in width. 
viii.  All trim must be smooth surface trim. No rough-saw trim will be accepted. 
ix.  Siding latticework, spindles, brackets and other decorative trim is encouraged. 
x.  T-1-11, ODB, plywood, aluminum or similar product styles and types are prohibited. 
xi.  Recreating historic details or features contrary to the original architectural style of the subject structure should not be done. 
f.  BRICK.

Chapter 17.28 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

17.28.010 - PUD intent, uses and standards.* 
A.  Uses. All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the plan commission. No uses are granted by right, and no uses are considered special exceptions. All land uses proposed in a planned unit development must be compatible with the intent of the comprehensive plan and the characteristics of surrounding land uses and zoning districts. 
B.  Development Requirements. Development requirements for all proposed planned unit developments shall be created by the applicant as part of the detailed plan submittal. All proposed development requirements are subject to the review and approval of the plan commission and common council. Generally, the planned unit development shall provide standards for the development that replace: (1) the lot standards established by Chapter 17.16, Zoning Districts; (2) each topic area regulated by Chapter 17.32, Development Standards; and (3) any standards replacing those established by the subdivision control ordinance. 
C.  Rules and Procedures. All proceedings brought under this chapter are subject to the rules and procedures of the plan commission. 
D.  Limitation of Ordinance Amendments. Any initiative of the plan commission to amend the zoning ordinance that would affect an approved planned unit development before its completion, shall not be enforced on the planned unit development. New amendments to the zoning ordinance shall only apply to planned unit developments that have been declared abandoned, or for which an approval has expired. 
E.  Origination of Proposals. Any applicant may propose a planned unit development district in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter. The applicant making the proposal must intend to act as developer or sponsor of the development. A parcel or site proposed for a planned unit development may or may not be under single ownership. However, if not under single ownership, the multiple owners must have a contractual agreement: (1) not to develop the parcels separately, but in accordance with a single, unified plan; and (2) in which the separate owners have given their express intentions to enter into such private agreements and to assure its completion as planned and to the satisfaction of the plan commission. 

*  Editor's Note: The references in this diagram to Sections 6.3 and 6.4 are Sections 17.28.030 and 17.28.040 of this code. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 6.1) 
*  Intent: The purpose of these regulations is to provide greater design flexibility in the development of land when consistent with the comprehensive plan and intent of the zoning and subdivision control ordinances. 
Planned unit development regulations are intended to encourage innovations in land development techniques so that unique opportunities and circumstances may be met with greater flexibility. Planned unit developments should be used to address unique environmental concerns, provide a unique mix of land uses, and implement the comprehensive plan in ways not considered by the established zoning districts. A planned unit development should not be used if the proposed development can be created using established zoning districts.

17.32.170 - Buffering and screening standards.* 
    Part 1: these general buffering standards apply to all zoning districts. 
A.  Buffer Yard Requirements.* The Buffer Yard Requirements Table describes the type of buffer yard that shall be installed. The required buffer yards shall meet the following minimum standards: 
1.  Buffer Yard Type 1. Buffer yard type 1 shall include a minimum setback of ten (10) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this title. In addition, one broad-leaf deciduous canopy tree must be planted in the buffer yard for every thirty (30) feet of boundary between the subject and adjoining properties. 
2.  Buffer Yard Type 2. Buffer yard type 2 shall include a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this title. In addition, one broad-leaf deciduous canopy tree and two evergreen conifers shall be planted in the buffer yard for every twenty-five (25) feet of boundary between the properties. 
3.  Buffer Yard Type 3. Buffer yard type 3 shall include a minimum setback of twenty-five (25) feet in addition to the yard setback otherwise required by this title. In addition, a row of broad-leaf deciduous canopy trees shall be planted parallel to the property line within the buffer yard with one tree placed every twenty (20) feet along the boundary between the subject and adjoining properties. Also, a six-foot tall opaque wooden fence or brick/stone wall, a five-foot tall undulating mound planted with shrubs, or a row of evergreen conifers shall be provided. 
a.  If an undulating mound is used the slope shall be a maximum of three is to one (rise:run), one shrub for every ten (10) feet of continuous boundary shall be planted on the mound. All required shrubs shall be eighteen (18) inches tall, measured from grade, at planting. 
b.  If a row of evergreen trees is used, one tree shall be placed every ten (10) feet along the property boundary. All evergreen trees shall be five feet in height, measured from the top of the rootball, at the time of planting.

B.  Buffer Yard Standards. The buffer yard standards only apply along the property lines where the two conflicting zoning districts meet as specified in the Buffer Yard Requirements Table. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the presence of streets, alleys, streams and other features separating property lines in conflicting zoning districts. 
1.  Responsibility. The developer or owner of the property being developed or otherwise changed in use is responsible for installing the buffer yard at the time of that development or change. The adjacent property owner shall not have to participate in installing the buffer yard. 
2.  Buffer Yard Location. All required buffer yard areas shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall be in addition to setbacks required by this title. 
3.  Planting Location. Required buffer yard trees may be placed either at regular intervals or in irregular patterns representing a natural landscape. However, no two buffer yard trees (excluding evergreen trees) shall be placed within ten (10) feet of one another. No buffer yard or required landscape materials shall be placed within any easement, right-of-way, or septic field. 
4.  Tree Size. All broad leaf/deciduous trees must have at least a two and one-half inch caliper measured at six inches above the top of the rootball, and all evergreen conifers must be a minimum of five feet in height measured from the top of the rootball when planted. 
5.  Ground Cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees, shrubs or other landscaped materials shall be covered with grass or other ground covering vegetation. Landscaping stone or other non-vegetative surfaces may not be substituted for ground covering vegetation. 
6.  Application. No landscaping required by this section may be used to satisfy the minimum requirements of any other provisions of this title. 
7.  Maintenance. All landscape materials must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly appearance, free from all debris and refuse. 
a.  All plant material which is unhealthy or dead, in the opinion of the planning director, shall be replaced by the end of the next spring or fall planting season. 
b.  Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth inhibiting measures may only be used to ensure the public safety. 
    Part 2: These materials and equipment buffering standards apply to the multifamily residential, mixed-use, institutional and industrial zoning districts as follows: 
A.  Ground Level Requirements. All outdoor storage areas for completed products manufactured on-site, production materials, and equipment; dumpsters and waste containers; and mechanical equipment located on the ground shall be screened consistent with the following requirements. In no instance shall this be interpreted as applying to merchandise for sale that is temporarily or seasonally placed outdoors. 
1.  Fencing. A minimum six-foot tall, one hundred (100) percent opaque fence of wood, brick, or stone construction shall completely screen the area from the view of public streets and adjacent properties. Opaque, six-foot tall wooden gates shall be provided to access the facility. The gates shall generally remain closed, except when immediate access to the area is required. 
2.  Landscape Screening. Evergreen planting shall be provided around the exterior perimeter of the required fencing. 
a.  If evergreen shrubs are used they shall be a minimum of three feet tall at the time of planting, and planted at a maximum of three feet on center. 
b.  If evergreen trees are used they shall be conifers, a minimum of five feet tall at the time of planting, and shall be planted a maximum of six feet on center. 
B.  Roof-Top Requirements. All roof-top equipment, such as HVAC units, shall be screened from the view of all public streets by parapets, dormers, or other screens. The material of all such screens shall be consistent with the exterior materials used on the facade of the structure. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 7.17) 
*  Intent: The purpose of these buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts between the possible uses in one zoning district and those use in adjacent districts through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of conflict between the zoning districts determines the extent of the buffer required. 
17.32.180 - Exterior lighting standards.* 
    These general exterior lighting standards apply to all zoning districts: 
A.  General Requirements. All exterior lighting shall conform with the following general requirements: 
1.  Mounting Height Measurement. For the purposes of this section, the mounting height of all light fixtures shall be defined as the vertical distance between the grade level of the surface being illuminated and the bottom of the lighting fixture (luminaire). 
3.  Use of Timers/Dimmers. Wherever practicable, exterior lighting shall include timers, dimmers, and/or sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate unneeded lighting. 
4.  Electrical Service. The electrical service to all outdoor lighting fixtures shall be underground, unless the fixtures are mounted directly on buildings or utility poles. 
5.  Holiday Lighting. Holiday lighting shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
6.  Prohibited Lighting. The permanent or temporary use of spot lights, floodlights, and searchlights shall be prohibited unless otherwise specified in this section.

The maximum mounting height for all parking lot illuminating light fixtures shall be as follows: twenty (20) feet in all agricultural, single-family residential, and multifamily residential zoning districts; twenty-five (25) feet in all mixed-use and institutional zoning districts; and thirty (30) feet in all industrial zoning districts. 
C.  Illuminated Canopy Requirements. Lighting levels under canopies for gas stations, convenience stores, drive-up banking centers, and similar locations shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place on the property, and shall not be used for the purpose of illuminating signs. Such lighting shall conform with the following requirements: 
1.  Lighting Fixtures. Lighting fixtures on canopies shall conform to either of the following requirements: 
a.  All light fixtures mounted on the canopies shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy; or 
b.  The lighting of the canopy shall use indirect lighting through which light is beamed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the canopy by light fixtures that are shielded so that illumination is focused exclusively on the underside of the canopy. 
2.  Fixture Location. Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides of any canopy and the sides of the canopy shall not be illuminated. In no instances shall this be interpreted as prohibiting the placement of signs on the canopy which are illuminated consistent with the standards for sign illumination in this section. 
D.  Lighting of Exterior Display/Sales Areas. Lighting levels on exterior display/sales areas shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in such locations. Such lighting shall conform with the following requirements: 
1.  Lighting Fixtures. All lighting fixtures used to illuminate exterior display/sales areas shall be ninety (90) degree cut-off fixtures (luminaires) focused directly downward onto the display/sales area. Such light fixtures shall be located, mounted, aimed, and shielded so that direct light is not cast onto adjacent streets or properties. 
2.  Fixture Height. In no case shall fixtures be mounted at a height greater than twenty-five (25) feet above grade. 
3.  Fixture Location. All lighting fixtures and mounting poles shall be located within the areas being illuminated. 
E.  Lighting of Outdoor Athletic/Performance Facilities. Lighting for all outdoor athletic and performance facilities and events shall provide adequate light for the event or facility while minimizing light pollution and the illumination of adjacent streets and properties.

2.  Dual Lighting System. The use of spotlights and/or floodlights to illuminate the play/performance area shall be permitted. However, each facility shall be designed and constructed with a dual lighting system which permits the main lighting for the event (spotlighting, floodlighting, etc.) to be turned off, with an alternate low level lighting system used for clean-up, night maintenance and other activities. 
3.  Exemptions. Outdoor athletic fields and courts established as accessory uses to single and two-family residences shall be exempt from these requirements. 
F.  Security Lighting. Security lighting shall be coordinated with other lighting on the property to the extent possible and shall otherwise conform with the following requirements: 
1.  Nonresidential Lighting Fixtures. All security lighting in nonresidential areas shall be shielded and specifically aimed so that illumination is directed only to the intended area. The light source for any security lighting shall include shields that prevent their light source or lens from being visible from adjacent properties and/or streets. The use of general floodlighting fixtures shall be prohibited. Security lighting fixtures may be mounted on poles located no further than ten (10) feet from the perimeter of the area intended to be illuminated. 
2.  Residential Lighting Fixtures. Security lighting fixtures in residential areas shall make use of indirect and reflected lighting techniques to provide soft lighting under canopies, entry porches, or soffits. 
G.  Lighting of Building Facades. Building facades may be illuminated, subject to the following requirements: 
1.  Lighting Fixtures. Lighting fixtures shall be located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the building facade. Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or roads. 
2.  Lighting Direction. Lighting fixtures shall be designed to wash the facade of the building with light (rather than providing a spot or floodlight affect) and may be directed upward or downward onto the facade. Exterior facade lighting shall be contained on the building facade and shall focus on entries and architectural features. 
H.  Illuminated Signs. Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed onto only the sign face, with minimal light spillage. Lighting fixtures shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets, roads, or properties. In no instance shall this subsection be interpreted as prohibiting the use of neon signs. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 7.18) 
*  Intent: The purpose of these exterior lighting standards is to provide minimum outdoor lighting standards that protect the public safety and the general welfare of the community by reducing unsafe and unpleasant lighting conditions, such as light trespass and light pollution, while also promoting the safe and efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians and the security of local properties.

*  Intent: The purpose of these large scale retail standards is to establish additional requirements for these types of facilities in order to ensure that the unique hazards they present for pedestrian and vehicular circulation, as well as land use conflicts, are addressed and the general welfare of the community as a whole is protected. 
17.32.200 - Adult use standards.* 
    These general adult use standards apply to the industrial zoning district(s): 
    The city of Franklin is aware of, and is relying on information gathered by other communities such as Indianapolis, Indiana; New York, New York; Tucson, Arizona, Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona that demonstrates that adult uses are distinguishable from other business uses due to their negative impacts on the general welfare of neighboring portions of the community. Those negative impacts include increased crime, blight, and deprivation of property values. It has been recognized that local governments have a special concern in regulating adult uses to ensure that the adverse effects will minimized and not contribute to land use conflicts and the blighting of adjacent areas. It has been determined by the United States Supreme Court that local communities may demonstrate this concern by, after careful review of factual information, regulating the time, place, and manner in which adult uses occur. The intent of this section is to preserve the character and integrity of residential neighborhoods, to deter the spread of blight, and to protect minors from the objectionable characteristics of adult uses. Further, it is the intent of this section to minimize the level to which any particular commercial area is exposed to the secondary affects of adult businesses by discouraging the development of districts of such uses. 
A.  Permitted Use. Adult uses shall be permitted only in the IG industrial, general zoning district. 
B.  Separation Requirements. Adult uses shall be located a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet from any church, school, park, day care facility, residentially zoned area, public or cultural facility (such as city hall, libraries, etc.), or any other adult use. The distance shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest property lines of the lot on which each use is located. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 7.20) 
*  Intent: The purpose of these adult use standards is to establish specific requirements for adult uses that both ensure the viability of speech activities protected by the U.S. Constitution and prevent the land use conflicts that result from the secondary effects of the presence of such uses.

The site development plan review process is not intended to provide an alternative to rezoning, variance, special exception, platting, or other established procedures; but rather to allow for the administrative review of site conditions and plans for consistency with applicable requirements prior to the issuance of improvement location permits. 
Generally, site development plan review shall involve individual lots and shall occur after rezoning and plat approvals. Site development plan review may occur before or after any necessary board of zoning appeals applications based on the characteristics of each application.

Chapter 17.44 - NONCONFORMITIES 
Sections: 

17.44.010 - Nonconforming status.* 
A.  Illegal Nonconforming Described. A structure, lot, or use that is nonconforming and that was constructed or is being used without an approved improvement location permit or approval from the board of zoning appeals or plan commission is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this title and all other applicable city ordinances and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this title. 
B.  Legal Nonconforming ("Grandfathered") Described. Legal nonconforming differs from illegal nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a zoning ordinance or a change to the zoning ordinance (including the official zoning map). The structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the zoning ordinance enactment or change, the property no longer conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal nonconforming or "grandfathered." Legal conforming lots, structures, uses, etc., may continue in the manner and to the extent that they existed or were used at the time the change in the zoning ordinance was enacted. A certificate or other written acknowledgment of legal nonconformity shall be issued by the planning director upon request and the presentation of what he or she determines to be adequate evidence. 
C.  Exemptions. Structures, uses, and other property features that are nonconforming due to prior variance, special exception, or other approvals shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter, but shall conform to the terms of their approval. 
D.  Repairs and Maintenance. The following applies to legal nonconforming structures, uses of structures, or uses of structures and land in combination: 
1.  Ordinary Repairs. Work may be done for ordinary repairs or replacement of walls, heating, fixtures, wiring, plumbing, etc.; under the condition that the nonconforming features (setbacks, lot coverage, land use, etc.) are not increased. 
2.  Structures Declared Unsafe. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe condition of any structure that has been declared unsafe by the appropriate city official. 
E.  Nonconforming Lots of Record. All lots legally established and recorded with the Johnson County recorder prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet an applicable provision of this title (such as minimum area, width, or depth) shall be deemed legal nonconforming lots of record. Legal nonconforming lots of record may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development standards of the applicable zoning district of this title are met. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 10.1) 
*  Intent: Upon adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, some structures, lots, and uses, that were previously established and maintained consistent with all applicable requirements, may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. For this reason, this chapter has been written to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these structures, lots, and uses; referred to as legal nonconforming. This chapter may be referred to as the "grandfather" clause - if a use, structure, etc. was established legally under a previously applicable ordinance it shall be "grandfathered" (legal nonconforming). 
These regulations are intended to inform property owners about the options for using and modifying nonconforming properties and to support the eventual elimination of the nonconformities. 
17.44.020 - Nonconforming structures. 
A.  Legal Nonconforming Structures. Any structure (such as a primary structure, accessory structure, fence, etc.) lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the development standards (setbacks, height, etc.) shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure. 
B.  Continuation of Nonconforming Structures. The continuation and modification of nonconforming structures shall be consistent with the following requirements. 
1.  Increases in Nonconformity. No legal nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity without the approval of a variance by the board of zoning appeals. Any structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
2.  Intentional Alterations. Any legal nonconforming structure that is intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the discontinued legal nonconforming features may not be resumed. 
3.  Accidental Alterations. Legal nonconforming structures that are required to be altered or removed due to government action or damage from fire, flood, other natural disaster, or criminal act may be restored to their legal nonconforming condition. Such structures, if rebuilt or restored, shall be identical or smaller in volume, height, setback, scale, and all other aspects to that which was altered or removed. 
C.  Exception. A legal nonconforming single-family residence located in any mixed-use, industrial or institutional zoning district may be expanded by up to fifty (50) percent of the pre-expansion living area one time in any five-calendar year period. The expansion must be for the purpose of continuing the residential use of the property. Required setbacks for the expansion shall be either those established by the zoning on the property, or those provided by the pre-expansion structure, whichever is less restrictive. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 10.2) 
17.44.030 - Nonconforming site features. 
A.  Legal Nonconforming Site Features. Any site feature or improvement (such as landscaping, dumpster enclosures, parking space dimensions, etc.) lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the development standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming site feature. 
B.  Continuation of Nonconforming Structures. The continuation and modification of nonconforming site features shall be consistent with the following requirements. 
1.  Increases in Nonconformity. No legal nonconforming site feature shall be altered, removed, or otherwise modified in a manner that increases the amount of nonconformity. Site features may be modified an a manner that maintains or lessens the extent of the nonconformity. 
2.  Site Modifications. If building expansions or other changes to the property occur that require corresponding site feature improvements, the affected features shall only be required to be modified to the extent necessary to accommodate the property changes. For example, parking lot landscaping would only be required for new portions of a parking lot that was required to be expanded due to a change in the use of the property - the amount of landscaping in the pre-existing parking areas will be unaffected. The required installation of new site features shall not require the entire site to be brought into compliance with this title. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 10.3) 
17.44.040 - Nonconforming uses.* 
A.  Legal Nonconforming Uses. Any lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. 
B.  Continuation of Nonconforming Uses. A legal nonconforming use may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Modification of Structures. No existing structure devoted to a legal nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except as to change the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located or as otherwise specified in this subsection (B)(5) of this section. 
2.  New Structures. No new structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal nonconforming use of land. 
3.  Expansion Within Structures. Any legal nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of an existing structure that were plainly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this title or its subsequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the structure. 
4.  Expansion on the Property. No legal nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of land, or moved in whole or in part to any other portion of a lot than was occupied at the effective date of said ordinance. 
5.  Expansion of Nonconforming Residential Use. A legal nonconforming single-family residence located in any mixed-use, industrial or institutional zoning district may be expanded by up to fifty (50) percent of the pre-expansion living area one time in any five-calendar year period. The expansion must be for the purpose of continuing the residential use of the property. Required setbacks for the expansion shall be either those established by the zoning on the property, or those provided by the pre-expansion structure, whichever is less restrictive. 
6.  Change of Use (to Another Nonconforming Use). If no structural alterations are made, it is possible to change any nonconforming use to another nonconforming use. 
a.  Similar Uses. Nonconforming uses may be changed to another similar nonconforming use. For the purpose of this subsection similar uses shall be considered those within the same land use categories (such as office uses, retail uses (small scale), etc.) as provided by Chapter 17.16. 
b.  Dissimilar Uses. Nonconforming uses may only be changed to other dissimilar nonconforming uses with the approval of the board of zoning appeals (as a use variance). For the purpose of this subsection dissimilar uses shall be considered those that are not within the same land use categories (such as office uses, retail uses (small scale), etc.) as provided by Chapter 17.16. 
i.  The board may approve the change of use if it finds that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district in which it is located than the existing use; 
ii.  The board shall consider the development standards applicable to the proposed use established by this title and may make reasonable conditions as part of any approval. 
7.  Change of Use (to a Permitted Use). When a legal nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming use may not be resumed. 
8.  Discontinuation of Use. If a legal nonconforming use is intentionally discontinued for one year or longer, any subsequent use of such land, structure, or land and structure in combination shall conform to the provisions of this title. 
a.  Exemptions. Uses that are required to be discontinued due to government action that impedes access to the premises or damage from fire, flood, other natural disaster, or criminal act shall be exempt from this provision and may be restored. 
b.  Exemption Conditions. Such exempt uses, if restored, shall be identical in scale, volume, lot coverage, and all other aspects to that which was discontinued. 
9.  Nonconforming Structures and Land in Combination. Where legal nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, an intentional removal or alteration of the structure, or its use, that establishes conformity shall also eliminate the legal nonconforming status of the land. Legal nonconforming uses located in structures specifically constructed or modified to suit only such use are exempt from this provision and may be resumed if the structure has not been intentionally altered to serve other uses, used to house a permitted use, or used to house another nonconforming use with the approval of the board of zoning appeals as specified in subsection (B)(5) of this section. 
(Ord. 04-09 § 10.4) 
*  Example of Nonconforming Structures and Land in Combination: Legally established apartment units located in a single family dwelling zoning district at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title may continue to be used as apartments after a period of vacancy if the structure has not been modified to physically remove the apartments. 
17.44.050 - Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Legal Nonconforming Signs. Any sign, lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the development standards shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign. 
B.  Sign Defined. For the purposes of this chapter, a sign shall include the sign face and any supports, poles, frames, or other associated lighting, electrical, mechanical, and structural features. 
C.  Continuation of Nonconforming Signs. The continuation and modification of nonconforming signs shall be consistent with the following requirements: 
1.  Increases in Nonconformity. No legal nonconforming sign shall be enlarged or altered in terms of face area, height, or any other aspect that increases its nonconformity. 
2.  Intentional Alterations. Any legal nonconforming sign that is intentionally altered, moved for any distance, or replaced shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the discontinued legal nonconforming features may not be resumed. 
3.  Accidental Alterations. Legal nonconforming signs that are required to be altered or removed due to government action or damage resulting from fire, flood, other natural disaster, or a criminal act may be restored to their legal nonconforming condition. Such signs, if rebuilt or restored, shall conform with the requirements of this title, or shall be identical in scale and all other aspects to that which was altered or removed. 
4.  Sign Faces and Messages. The sign faces and/or message on a legal nonconforming sign may be altered, replaced, repainted, and repaired provided that the nonconformity of the sign is not increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as requiring a sign to be brought into conformance with this title if it is changed only to the extent that the face area is changed, but not increased in size or altered in shape. 
5.  Temporary Signs. Any signs in existence at the time this title becomes effective that were previously permitted as temporary signs may only remain in use consistent with the requirements of this title. Any temporary signs that are no longer permitted shall be removed within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.
