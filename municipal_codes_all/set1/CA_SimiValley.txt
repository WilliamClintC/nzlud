PREFACE 
The Simi Valley, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1975, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Verne H. Tindell, city attorney. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 19, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1294, passed January 14, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 1-1.01 is Section .01, in Chapter 1 of Title 1. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains 10 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and effective date. (Example: (§ 1, Ord. 1037, eff. June 11, 2003.) 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "1968 Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "1975 Code Section." 
As of Supplement No. 19, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (4-2, 6-1, 9-71).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 19, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 19, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 3-1.101 
Required when 3-1.104 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Any person occupying the position of Code Enforcement Officer shall be deemed to be a public officer, as that term is defined by Section 836.5 of the Penal Code of the State. There shall be no civil liability on the part of, and no cause of action shall arise against, any Code Enforcement Officer acting pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and within the scope of his authority for false arrest or false imprisonment arising out of any arrest which is lawful or which the Code Enforcement Officer, at the time of the arrest, had reasonable cause to believe was lawful.

Any Code Enforcement Officer may arrest any person without a warrant whenever the Code Enforcement Officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested, in the presence of the Code Enforcement Officer, has committed a misdemeanor or an infraction which is a violation of this Code, any ordinance of the City, or any Code adopted by reference by this Code.  
1-5.04 - Code Enforcement Officers: Procedures after arrest: Notices to appear. 
In any case in which a person is arrested for an offense declared to be a misdemeanor or an infraction, and such person does not demand to be taken before a magistrate, such person may, instead of being taken before a magistrate, be released according to the procedures set forth in this section. For the purposes of this section, a Code Enforcement Officer shall be deemed to be the "arresting officer". 
(a)  If the arresting officer or his superior determines that the person should be released, such officer or superior shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court, containing the name and address of such person, the offense charged, and the time and place where and when such person shall appear in court. If the person is not released prior to being booked, and the officer in charge of the booking or his superior determines that the person should be released, such officer or superior shall prepare such written notice to appear in court. 
(b)  Unless waived by the person, the time specified in the notice to appear shall be at least five (5) days after his arrest. 
(c)  The place specified in the notice shall be the court of the magistrate before whom the person would be taken, if the requirement of taking an arrested person before a magistrate were complied with, or shall be an officer authorized by such court to receive a deposit of bail.

Thereupon the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
(e)  The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein. 
(§ 13-1, S.V.M.C., and §§ 1 and 2, Ord. 130)

(a)  Whenever a written notice to appear has been prepared, delivered, and filed with the court pursuant to the provisions of Section 1-5.04 of this chapter, an exact and legible duplicate copy of the notice, when filed with the magistrate in lieu of a verified complaint, shall constitute a complaint to which the defendant may plead "guilty" or "nolo contendere". 
If, however, the defendant violates his promise to appear in court, or does not deposit lawful bail, or pleads other than "guilty" or "nolo contendere" to the offense charged, a complaint shall be filed which shall conform to the provisions of this Code and which shall be deemed to be an original complaint; and thereafter proceedings shall be had as provided by law, except that a defendant, by an agreement in writing, subscribed by him and filed with the court, may waive the filing of a verified complaint and elect that the prosecution may proceed upon a written notice to appear. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, whenever the written notice to appear has been prepared on a form approved by the Judicial Council, an exact and legible duplicate copy of the notice, when filed with the magistrate, shall constitute a complaint to which the defendant may enter a plea and, if the notice to appear is verified, upon which a warrant may be issued. If the notice to appear is not verified, the defendant, at the time of arraignment, may request that a verified complaint be filed.  
1-5.06 - Failure to appear. 
Any person who wilfully violates his written promise to appear in court shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was originally arrested.

1-5.08 - Issuance. 
It is hereby made the duty of the Code Enforcement Officers to issue citations to those persons found in violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance enacted by the City. In addition, police aides are hereby authorized to issue citations for parking law violations and to enforce the provisions of Sections 22657 and 22702 of the Vehicle Code of the State if they are regularly salaried employees engaged in the enforcement of parking law violations and are so designated by the Chief of Police. Such officers shall, upon satisfactory evidence of the identity of such persons, take the name and address of the violator and notify him in writing of the hearing before a judge at a time and place specified in such notice, unless such violator demands to be taken immediately before a magistrate.

Chapter 8 - CIVIL FINES 
 
1-8.101 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to enable civil fines in conjunction with the enforcement of this Code. Notwithstanding the provisions in this chapter, the City has and shall continue to employ the philosophy of voluntary compliance when seeking compliance with this Code. Prior to the implementation of the policies and procedures stated in this chapter, voluntary compliance policies and procedures; such as, personal contact, letters, assistance from other agencies, etc., may be utilized first in order to educate the public on the requirements contained in the Code and to abate the violation. Experience has found, that once educated, the vast majority of citizens will comply with City ordinances. Therefore, the policies and procedures stated in this chapter are for the minority who do not respond to voluntary compliance and may need a further incentive to comply.

By adopting this chapter, the City does not intend to limit its discretion to utilize any other remedy, civil or criminal, for such violations that the City may select in a particular case. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any lease, license or any other instrument or agreement, the owner of any real property has the right to enter upon his or her own property to the extent reasonably necessary and prescribed by law to abate any nuisance or correct any violation of this Code existing thereon. The provisions of this subsection shall be an implied term of any instrument affecting the right to possession of real property located in the City. 
(e)  Because serious Code violations may impact health and safety, this chapter is intended to impose strict civil liability upon the owners and lessees of real property for all violations of the Simi Valley Municipal Code which may occur in the City.

(2)  The failure of the person with an interest in the property to receive any notice served in accordance with this chapter shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this Code. If the address of the owner of record, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days. 
(h)  Proof of personal service of the Notice and Order shall be documented at the time of service by a declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting service, declaring the time and manner in which service was made. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998)  
1-8.106 - Extension of time. 
If the Director receives a request from any person required to comply with a Notice and Order, the Director may grant an extension of any fine due date and abatement deadline if the Director determines that such an extension of time will not create or perpetuate imminent danger to life or property. The Director shall have the authority to place reasonable conditions on any such extensions. (§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998 as amended by § 1, Ord. No. 1267, eff. March 9, 2017)  
1-8.107 - Amount of civil fines.

(b)  Fines are due on the day specified in the Notice and Order or, in the event of an appeal, as determined by the hearing administrator.

(a)  Fines shall be paid to the Director within thirty (30) days of the due date.

The Director, for purposes of convenience and ease of processing, may authorize payment to be made in accordance with any other method, at any location within the City, or to any address. 
(b)  Payment of a fine shall not excuse the person from correcting the Code violation. The issuance of Notice and Order and/or payment of a fine does not bar the City from taking any other enforcement action regarding a Code violation that is not corrected, including issuing additional Notice and Orders and/or criminal complaints. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998)  
1-8.109 - Appeal of Notice and Order. 
(a)  Any person aggrieved by the action of the Director in issuing a Notice and Order pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may appeal such notice to the hearing administrator. If no appeal is filed within ten (10) days of the date of issuance of the Notice and Order, the order of the Director shall be final. Revocation of the Notice and Order by the hearing administrator or voluntary abatement of the nuisance either on or prior to the Notice and Order due date, and any authorized extensions thereto, shall cause the case to be closed. 
(b)  To appeal a Notice and Order, the person shall file a signed written request following the procedures outlined in the Notice and Order. An appellant may contest the Notice and Order by denying that a violation occurred, by denying that it was not corrected within the correction period, if applicable, or by denying that the appellant is a responsible person for the violation. 
(c)  To be effective and complete, the request must be received by the Director within ten (10) days of the date the Notice and Order was issued. Where a request is mailed by the appellant, the request shall be deemed filed on the date received by the Director. All requests shall be date-stamped upon receipt. The Director is authorized to designate an address to which such requests shall be mailed. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998)  
1-8.110 - Hearing procedures.

(e)  The Notice and Order and any other reports prepared by City Code Enforcement Officers or the Director concerning a Code violation or attempted correction of a Code violation that are provided to the hearing administrator shall be accepted by the hearing administrator as prima facie evidence of the Code violation and the facts stated in such documents. 
(f)  The hearing administrator may continue a hearing if a request is made showing good cause by the appellant or the Director. Good cause means facts or circumstances that the hearing administrator, in his or her sole discretion, determines justify continuing the hearing. All continuance requests shall either: (1) be made in person at the hearing by the appellant or his or her representative if the appellant is physically unable to attend, or (2) be made by a written request received from the Director. If the continuance is granted, a new hearing date shall be set within thirty (30) days. If the continuance is denied, the hearing shall proceed then and there as scheduled, and if the appellant is not present, the request(s) shall be deemed abandoned in accordance with subsection (h) of this section. 
(g)  The hearing shall be conducted informally and the legal rules of evidence need not be followed. The hearing administrator does not have the authority to issue a subpoena. 
(h)  The failure of the appellant to appear at the hearing, unless the hearing was continued per subsection (f) of this section, shall constitute an abandonment of the appeal, and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the violation set forth in the Notice and Order. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998, as amended by § 3, Ord. 1095, eff. July 19, 2006)  
1-8.111 - Appeal decision. 
(a)  After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at an appeal hearing, the hearing administrator shall issue a Notice of Decision, within two (2) business days, to either uphold or revoke the Notice and Order based upon a conclusion of whether a violation occurred for which the appellant was a responsible person. The Notice of Decision shall be mailed within one business day subsequent to the hearing administrator's issuance of the Notice of Decision by first class and certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the appellant or the representative, per Section 1-8.105(g) of this chapter. The failure to appear by the appellant shall be noted on the Notice of Decision by the hearing administrator. At any time prior to the hearing, the Director may, and after the hearing, the hearing administrator may, reduce or cancel the amount of any fine or revoke the Notice and Order in unusual cases when extenuating circumstances make it appropriate in the interest of justice. The decision of the hearing administrator shall be final. 
(b)  The filing of an appeal shall suspend any fine assessed in the Notice and Order. In the event that the Notice and Order is revoked, the fine shall also be revoked. In the event that the Notice and Order is upheld, a new compliance deadline and fine due date shall be established by the hearing administrator and recorded on the Notice of Decision. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998, as amended by § 4, Ord. 1095, eff. July 19, 2006)  
1-8.112 - Right to judicial review. 
(a)  The appellant may seek judicial review of the hearing administrator's decision by filing an appeal with the Superior Court within twenty (20) calendar days after the appellant receives a copy of the Notice of Decision at the conclusion of the hearing in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 53069.4. The appeal filed with the court must also contain a proof of service showing a copy of the appeal was served upon "City of Simi Valley (Attention: City Attorney)." The appellant must pay to the Superior Court the appropriate filing fee when the appeal is filed. 
(b)  No appeal is permitted from a decision where the appellant is deemed to have abandoned the contest of the Notice and Order by an unexcused failure to appear at the hearing. 
(c)  The City Attorney or the City Attorney's designee shall forward to the Superior Court within fifteen (15) days of its request, the pertinent Notice and Order documents for any case appealed to that Court. If the Superior Court revokes any Notice and Order, the City will refund the Superior Court filing fee paid by the appellant. 
(§ 3 (part), Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998)  
1-8.113 - Collection of unpaid fines. 
(a)  The City, at its discretion, may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies for the collection of unpaid civil fines. 
(1)  Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the pursuit of any other remedies until the total fines owed by a person under this chapter have been collected. 
(2)  A City permit/issuing department may refuse to accept an application or issue, extend or renew to any person, who has unpaid delinquent fines, liens or assessments, any City permit, license, or other City approval pertaining to the property that is the subject to a Notice and Order and fine. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, any permit, license or any type of land use approval issued by the City to a person who has unpaid fines totaling Five Hundred and No/100ths ($500.00) Dollars or more which remain delinquent for thirty (30) days or longer may be suspended by the permitting/issuing department. The suspension becomes effective ten (10) days after the date the notice of the suspension is placed by the permitting/issuing department in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the person, and continues until the delinquency is paid in full. The person may request a review hearing pursuant to the specific permit, license or other City approval procedures if such a request is filed before the ten (10) day period ends. Continuing to operate under a suspended permit, license or approval shall be grounds for the City Council to revoke the permit, license or approval. Revocations shall be processed by the permit/issuing department and may be made by the City Council at a public hearing for which the person is given at least ten (10) days' prior written notice. 
(4)  The City Attorney, at his or her discretion, may issue a criminal citation or complaint for a willful failure, without lawful excuse, to pay a civil fine for each day the fine, or a portion thereof, goes unpaid after it becomes due. For purposes of this subsection only, a fine becomes due thirty (30) days after notice is sent to the person fined at his or her last known address stating the amount of the fine, the due date, and that failure to pay the fine by the due date constitutes a criminal offense for each day thereafter the fine, or any portion thereof, remains unpaid. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid and by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. 
(b)  Any violation of his Code shall constitute a public nuisance. The Director may pursue the following remedies whether or not the City is pursuing any other action to terminate an ongoing Code violation that was the basis for the fine. To compel Code compliance, the City may seek to collect assessed fines by means of a nuisance abatement lien and/or special assessment against the property where a property-related violation occurred in accordance with the procedures in Government Code Sections 38773.1 and 38773.5. Any unpaid delinquent civil fines may be recovered as a lien or special assessment against the property of the responsible person who is the owner of the property where the violation occurred. 
(c)  To recover any delinquent civil fines as a lien or special assessment, the following conditions must be met: 
(1)  The Director must submit to and receive from the City Council a resolution certifying the amounts of the liens and special assessments sought to be collected from each property owner; and 
(2)  The total amount of the delinquent fine against the property owner must be delinquent for sixty (60) days or more. 
(d)  The Director is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce collection of the lien or special assessment, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Request the County Recorder to record a notice of any lien or special assessment certified by the City Council; 
(2)  Request the County Tax Collector on behalf of the City to collect any special assessments certified by the City Council. 
(e)  All Notice and Orders shall contain a notice that unpaid fines are subject to the assessment and lien collection procedures of this section. This notice shall satisfy the notice requirements of Government Code Sections 38773.1 and 38773.5 when a Notice and Order is served on the person. In addition, the Director shall by first-class mail send notice to each property owner at least ten (10) days before the City Council considers the resolution to certify the amounts of the liens and special assessments stating the date, time and location of the meeting. The lien or special assessment shall be imposed on the date the Notice and Order for the Code violation is issued to the responsible person and become effective upon the recording of a Notice of Lien or special assessment by the County Recorder. 
(f)  A person may contest the amount and/or validity of any lien or special assessment for a civil fine at the public hearing when the City Council considers the resolution to certify the liens and assessments. Such contests shall be limited to the issue of the amount and/or validity to the lien or assessment and may not consider whether the underlying Code violation occurred. Pursuit of such a contest by a person is necessary to exhaust the administrative remedies concerning a legal challenge to the validity of any such lien or special assessment. 
(§ 3, Ord. 940, eff. December 24, 1998, as amended by § 1, Ord. 995, eff. April 5, 2001)  
1-8.114 - Abatement warrants. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Simi Valley Municipal Code ("Code") or state law, once a Notice and Order to abate a nuisance has been issued pursuant to this Chapter 8 ("Civil Fines"); pursuant to Title 5, Chapter 36 ("Property Maintenance"); Title 8, Chapter 3 ("Organization and Enforcement"); or pursuant to any other section of this Code or state law, and any applicable appeal period for such Notice and Order has run or has been waived, if the nuisance is not abated in the time period set forth in the Notice and Order, the City Attorney is hereby authorized to file a petition to a court of competent jurisdiction at the City Attorney's discretion for an inspection and/or abatement warrant ("Abatement Warrant") authorizing City enforcement officers or any employee, authorized agent, representative or contractor of the City to enter onto any affected property to inspect and abate the nuisance condition described in the Notice and Order. An Abatement Warrant, as contemplated in this section, shall be requested pursuant to the procedures provided by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1822.50, et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or the successor provisions thereto, pertaining to inspection warrants. 
The costs of obtaining and carrying out the Abatement Warrant shall be included within the costs recoverable by the City for such Notice and Order and include, but are not limited to, any cost incurred by the City in performing or contracting for work required to achieve compliance with the Abatement Warrant, administrative costs, and costs of civil prosecution of the nuisance condition, including attorneys' fees and costs, all as permitted by law. These costs shall be invoiced to the property owner for payment and collection in accordance with the specific cost recovery procedures set forth in the Code regarding the issuance of the particular Notice and Order. At the City Attorney's discretion, or if no particular Code section sets forth cost recovery procedures with respect to the Notice and Order, the procedures set forth in Section 5-36.115 et seq. may be utilized for cost recovery. 
(§ 2(Exh. A), Ord. No. 1284, eff. January 8, 2018, as amended by § 1(Exh. A), Ord. No. 1285, eff. March 1, 2018)

Such subpoenas extend to all parts of the State and may be served by any person authorized to serve process in courts of record or by any person designated for that purpose by the issuing authority. The refusal of a person to attend or testify or produce the documents subpoenaed shall be subject to the procedures contained in Government Code Sections 37106 through 37109.

A majority of the members of the Council shall be sufficient to do business, and motions may be passed by a two (2) to one vote if only three (3) members attend; provided, however, ordinances, resolutions granting franchises, and the payment of money shall require at least three (3) affirmative votes. 
(§ 3, Res. 69-27)  
2-1.105 - Agenda. 
Any matter for Council action or discussion at a regular or adjourned regular meeting of the Council shall appear on the regular agenda as a specific agenda item and shall be submitted to the City Clerk not later than 4:30 p.m. on the Wednesday preceding the meeting.

(§ 10, Res. 69-27, as added by Res. 70-12)  
2-1.106 - Closure times. 
All agenda and nonagenda items of the Council which have not been heard, or are not in the process of being heard, by 12:00 midnight on the evening of a regular or regular adjourned meeting of the Council shall be deferred until the next regular or regular adjourned meeting, unless overridden by a majority of the Council members at such meeting. 
(§ 11, Res. 69-27, as added by Res. 71-62)  
2-1.107 - Minutes. 
(a)  The minutes shall be the concern of the Council until presented to the Council for approval. The Council may then, by motion, make such corrections as conform to fact. 
(b)  The minutes shall be a clear and concise statement of the action of the Council, including the motions made and the vote thereon. The reasons for making a motion, the Council debate, and the audience reaction are usually irrelevant and may be included or omitted as the Council may choose. 
(c)  Whenever the Council acts in a quasijudicial proceeding, such as zoning hearings, a summary of the testimony of the witnesses shall be completed and included in the minutes. 
(d)  The minutes shall reflect a "no objection" vote as "unanimously carried". Approval of the minutes shall be effected only by a voice vote or a roll call vote. 
(§§ 5 and 9, Res. 69-27)  
2-1.108 - Motions. 
(a)  Processing motions. When a motion is made and seconded, such motion shall be stated by the Mayor, or by the City Clerk at the direction of the Mayor, before debate. A motion once stated may not be withdrawn by the mover without the consent of the member seconding such motion and without the approval of the Council. 
(b)  Motions out of order. The Mayor, by a majority consent of the members of the Council, may at any time permit a member of the Council to introduce an ordinance, resolution, or motion out of the regular agenda order. 
(c)  Divisions of questions. If the question contains two (2) or more divisible propositions, the Mayor may, and upon the request of a member of the Council shall, unless appealed, divide the question. 
(d)  Precedence of motions. When a motion is before the Council, no motion shall be entertained except as follows: 
(1)  To adjourn the meeting; 
(2)  To fix the hour of adjournment of the meeting; 
(3)  To lay the matter on the table; 
(4)  For the previous question; 
(5)  To postpone the meeting to a certain day; 
(6)  To refer the matter; 
(7)  To amend the motion; or 
(8)  To postpone the matter indefinitely. 
Such motions shall have precedence in the order indicated. 
(e)  Motions to adjourn the meeting (not debatable). A motion to adjourn the meeting shall be in order at any time, except as follows: 
(1)  When repeated without intervening business or discussion; 
(2)  When made as an interruption of a member while speaking; 
(3)  When the previous question has been ordered; and 
(4)  While a vote is being taken. 
A motion to adjourn to another time shall be debatable only as to the time to which the meeting shall be adjourned. 
(f)  Motions to fix the hour of adjournment. The purpose of a motion to fix the hour of adjournment shall be to set a definite time at which to adjourn the meeting. Such motion shall not be debated or amended except as to the time set. 
(g)  Motions to table. The purpose of a motion to table a matter shall be to temporarily bypass the subject. A motion to lay on the table shall be undebatable and shall preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the motion shall prevail, the matter may be taken from the table at any time prior to the end of the next regular meeting. 
(h)  Motions for previous question. The purpose of a motion for a previous question shall be to close the debate on the main motion and shall be undebatable. The shouting of "Question" shall not accomplish the same thing. If the motion shall fail, the debate shall be reopened. If the motion shall pass, the Council shall vote on the main motion. 
(i)  Motions to amend. Motions to amend shall be debatable only as to the amendment. A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but a motion to amend an amendment to an amendment shall not be in order. An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order, but an amendment relating to a different matter shall not be in order. A substitute motion on the same subject shall be acceptable. The amendment to the motion shall be voted on first; then the main motion, as amended, shall be voted on. 
(j)  Motions to postpone. Motions to postpone indefinitely shall be fully debatable. If a motion to postpone indefinitely is adopted, the principal question shall be declared lost. Motions to postpone to a definite time shall be amendable and debatable as to the propriety of the postponement and the time set. Motions to refer similarly shall not be debatable, except for the propriety of referring. 
(§ 6, Res. 69-27)  
2-1.109 - Voting. 
(a)  Procedure. On the passage of every motion, the vote shall be taken by voice or roll call and entered in full upon the record. Motions may be adopted by the "no objection" method, unless a Councilman prefers a voice or roll call vote. 
The Council shall follow the roll call procedure for ordinances, resolutions for franchises, and orders for the payment of money. A roll call vote shall not be necessary for any other action unless a member of the Council shall demand such roll call vote. 
Upon the demand of any member made before the negative has been put, the roll call shall be called for yeas and nays upon any question before the Council. It shall not be in order for members to explain their vote during the roll call. Any member may change his vote before the next order of business. 
(b)  Abstaining. Every member should vote unless disqualified for cause or by self disqualification and accepted by the vote of the Council or by the opinion of the City Attorney. No Councilman shall be forced to vote. The abstainer consents that a majority of the quorum may act for him. 
(c)  Tie votes. Tie votes shall be considered as lost motions and may be reconsidered later. 
(§§ 4, 6 (part), and 9, Res. 69-27)  
2-1.110 - Voting: Reconsideration. 
Any member of the Council who voted with the majority may move for a reconsideration of any action at the same meeting or have the reconsideration entered on the minutes for a vote at the next succeeding meeting providing no legal rights have intervened to create an estoppel. After a motion for a reconsideration has once been acted on, no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made without unanimous consent. 
(§ 6 (part), Res. 69-27)  
2-1.111 - Questions of personal privilege. 
The right of a Councilman to address the Council on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which his integrity, character, or motives are questioned or where the welfare of the Council is concerned.

(§ 6 (part), Res. 69-27)  
2-1.112 - Decisions of the Mayor: Appeals. 
Any decision or ruling of the Mayor may be appealed to the Council as a whole by a request of any member of the Council. The Mayor shall call for a roll call vote to see if the chair shall be upheld. If the roll call vote loses, the decision or ruling of the Mayor shall be reversed.

(3)  There may be discussion of the motion. 
(4)  There shall be a voice vote. 
(5)  The result shall be declared. 
Any member of the Council may call for a roll call vote or demand that the resolution be read in full.

(3)  If adopted, the City Attorney shall prepare such resolution for presentation to the Council. 
(c)  The procedure set forth in subsection (b) of this section may be waived in rush matters, and the resolution may be presented verbally in motion form, together with instructions for the written preparation thereof for later execution. In such event, the voting procedure set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be used after the resolution has been verbally stated. This shortcut procedure should be avoided, except when it is absolutely necessary. The shortcut procedure should be avoided entirely when resolutions are required by law or for improvement acts, zoning matters, and force account work on public projects. 
(d)  Resolutions shall be effective upon their adoption. 
(§ 7, Res. 69-27)  
2-1.114 - Ordinances. 
(a)  Any ordinance may be read by title only at either or both of the first and second readings. Any member of the Council may demand a roll call vote on motions to read by title only. A vote to read the ordinance by title only shall be unanimous, otherwise the motion shall fail, and the ordinance shall be read in full. 
(b)  The following procedure shall be used for the passage of ordinances: 
(1)  A motion shall be made to introduce the ordinance for first reading. No second or vote shall be required at this time. After the first reading of an ordinance, no change may be made other than typographical errors and clerical corrections. When ordinances, other than urgency ordinances, are altered after introduction, they shall be reintroduced by a first reading. 
(2)  At least five (5) days after the introduction of the ordinance, the ordinance shall be again read, either in full or by title only, and shall be adopted in accordance with the following procedures: 
(i)  A motion shall be made to adopt the ordinance. 
(ii)  The motion shall be seconded. 
(iii)  There may be discussion of the motion. 
(iv)  There shall be a roll call vote. 
(v)  The result shall be declared based upon the number of affirmative votes required by law. 
(c)  If any urgency ordinance is introduced for adoption and shall fail to receive an affirmative vote of four-fifths (4/5) of the members of the Council, such ordinance shall be treated as if it had not been read as an urgency enactment. Urgency ordinances shall become effective immediately and shall thereafter be published in the manner prescribed by law. 
(d)  All ordinances, except urgency ordinances, shall become effective on 12:01 a.m. of the thirty-first (31st) day after their adoption and shall be published or summarized for publication and posted in the manner prescribed by law. 
(§ 8, Res. 69-27, as amended by § 2, Ord. 452, eff. November 12, 1980)  
2-1.115 - Consent calendars. 
The meeting agenda of the Council shall include a consent calendar which shall consist of information, purchase or bid authorizations, acceptances of bids or projects, permit approvals, routine or confirming resolutions, and other usual and routine items of business, not including ordinances. The adoption or approval of all items on the consent calendar may be accomplished by one motion passed on a roll call vote. 
All items placed on the consent calendar shall be supported, as necessary, by documentation relative to each item, which documentation shall be made available to the public. The documentation shall normally be in the nature of a staff report and shall include a specific and concise recommendation relative to the requested Council action. By the approval of the consent calendar, the action recommended shall be deemed the action taken by the Council.

If the property owner objects to the designation of his property as a Cultural Heritage Site, such objection shall be filed with the City Clerk prior to the time the City Council makes a determination at a public hearing to declare or not declare the property a Cultural Heritage Site. This time period shall not exceed ninety (90) days, during which time the property owner shall be prohibited from the defacement, demolition, alteration, removal of, or addition to the proposed Cultural Heritage Site. Notices of such hearings shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and posted in a conspicuous place in the City Hall not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearings. 
If the City Council determines that a proposed Cultural Heritage Site should be officially so declared, the property owner shall be prohibited from the defacement, demolition, alteration, removal of, or addition to the declared Cultural Heritage Site without obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness pursuant to SVMC Section 2-3.509.

(b)  Requirement for a Certificate of Appropriateness. Unless exempt pursuant to Section 2-3.509(h), the property owner of a designated Cultural Heritage Site will be prohibited from the alteration, addition, demolition, defacement, or removal of such designated site, without first complying with at least one of the following: 
(1)  Obtained a Certificate of Appropriateness; or 
(2)  Filed for a Certificate of Appropriateness and waited the time specified in SVMC Section 2-3.509(e), without any action being taken on the property owner's request for a Certificate of Appropriateness.

Requests shall include plans and specifications as necessary to evaluate the proposed change(s), and how the proposed change(s) is appropriate for the area. The request must be accompanied by any other information the Board determines is required to make an informed determination on the proposed work according to the standards of review pursuant to SVMC Section 2-3.509(d). Within thirty (30) days of the application filing date, the Board shall inform the applicant in writing whether the application is complete and has been accepted for processing, or that the application is incomplete and that additional information must be provided to make the application complete. Failure of the Board to respond within thirty (30) days of application submittal with a determination as to completeness shall be deemed a determination that the application is complete. Submittal of the additional Board-requested information shall establish a new thirty-day period for a determination of completeness. 
(d)  Approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Unless exempt pursuant to Section 2-3.509(h), in evaluating requests for Certificates of Appropriateness, the Board, at a scheduled public meeting, will consider the existing architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, materials, and any other factors with regard to the site's original distinguishing characteristics. Using the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects as a guide, the Board will approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for any proposed work only if the Board makes at least one of the following findings: 
(1)  The proposed work will not adversely affect the integrity of significant architectural features or the character of historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value of the site. 
(2)  In the case of construction of a new improvement, addition, building, or structure upon the site, the use, scale and massing, and exterior of such construction will not adversely affect, and will be compatible with, the use and/or exterior of the site. 
(3)  Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness will do one or more of the following: 
(i)  Deprive the property owner of all reasonable use of or economic return on the property; 
(ii)  Result in a hardship due to conditions applicable to the structure or other feature involved; and/or 
(iii)  Cause damage to the property owner unreasonable in comparison to the benefit conferred to the community. 
A Board decision may be appealed to the City Council by any interested person or the City Council within fourteen (14) days of the date of the decision.

(f)  Non-action afer Certificate of Appropriateness approval. If the property owner has not acted on the Certificate of Appropriateness within one year and one hundred eighty days (180) days from the Certificate of Appropriateness approval, the Certificate of Appropriateness shall expire. 
(g)  Administrative Certificate of Appropriateness.

2-9.110 - General contracting provisions. 
(a)  Contract authority limits. For purposes of this chapter, contract or purchasing authority directly provided through this chapter to specified city officials accrues on a yearly basis. Any purchases, or renewals of contracts or purchases, or services with the same party or parties for the same or related project or item within any twelve (12) month period which in the aggregate would exceed the contract authority limits in this chapter, require approval by the City Council, or if such purchase is subject to the authority of the Purchasing Agent, by the City Manager, unless either: 1) a new competitive process has been used; or 2) an exemption from competitive process under Section 2-9.201(e) applies; or 3) in the case of a Department Head purchase exceeding aggregate limits, the purchase is approved by the Purchasing Agent. Contracts are valued by the amount of compensation provided or received by the City, and including any optional renewals; contracts based on a commission or percentage basis are valued on a reasonable estimate of the likely compensation to be received or provided. After consecutive renewals up to an aggregate term of three (3) years, for contracts or purchases in which at least one year's expenditure exceeds $7,500.00, if a new competitive process has not been used or an exemption therefrom does not apply to a contract; or more than six (6) months have not passed after the expiration of the contract or purchase, and further provided that, the total amount expended exceeds the one year authority limit for the signing authority, any further renewals must be approved by the City Council, if subject to the City Manager's authority, or the City Manager, if subject to the Purchasing Agent's authority. 
(b)  Contract term. Any contract with a term longer than five (5) years including any optional renewals, regardless of contract amount, shall be approved by the City Council, unless otherwise specified in this chapter. 
(c)  Change orders and amendments. The City Manager has authority to approve change orders and amendments to contracts approved by the City Council up to ten (10%) percent or $100,000.00 of the original contract amount, whichever is less, and may further amend the term of such contracts, when the work is reasonably related to the scope of work authorized under the original contract. 
(d)  Delegation. City personnel authorized in this chapter may delegate the authority granted in this chapter whenever such delegation is deemed necessary or desirable for the efficient administration of purchasing and contracting activities. 
(e)  Purchases involving grant funds. The Purchasing Agent can authorize contracting, bidding and purchasing procedures required by the terms of any federal or state grant terms which may differ from the requirements of this chapter. 
(f)  Gifts or grants to City. The City Manager may accept, and sign any necessary documents related thereto, gifts or grants to the City which do not exceed $10,000.00, and which do not involve policy decisions or significant additional expenditures as determined by the City Manager. 
(g)  Method of contracting. The City may utilize purchase orders, purchasing cards, written contracts, or verbal purchases (in the case of verbal purchases only, up to a limit of $1,000.00). The Purchasing Agent, with the approval of the City Manager, may specify further parameters and limits for each method of contracting. The City Attorney shall review and approve all standard purchase order forms to be utilized by the City, and shall approve as to form any written contract above an amount set by the Purchasing Agent. 
(h)  Regulatory penalties. The City Manager is authorized to accept, pay and sign all documents related to regulatory penalties or fines incurred in the regular course of business up to $10,000.00, unless policy decisions are implicated in the payment of such penalties as determined by the City Manager. 
(i)  Land or real estate interests. The sale, purchase, acceptance or rental of real estate or interests in land, excepting licenses, shall be approved by the City Council, except that the City Manager may approve transactions involving certain real property interests, including but not limited to fee interests, easements, offers of dedication and rights of entry ("Development Real Estate Interests"), provided that such Development Real Estate Interests are part of or directly related to a land use action, environmental mitigation, public works project, entitlement or agreement previously approved by the City, including but not limited to subdivision maps, building permits, or zone changes, or if the right of entry or easement is temporary for a City purpose such as maintenance or other work for the public benefit. When any transaction involving real property is approved by an official specifically authorized under this Code, the City Manager or the City Council, the City Manager or designee is authorized to sign any certificate of acceptance required under Government Code 27281 to be recorded. 
(§ 1, Ord. No. 1271 and WWD-16, eff. June 15, 2017 as amended by § 1, Ord. No. 1281 and WWD-17, eff. December 14, 2017)  
Article 2. - Purchasing and Contracting for Supplies, Equipment, Maintenance Services, and Public Projects 
 
2-9.201 - Purchasing and contracting procedures. 
Purchases and contracts for supplies, equipment, maintenance services, and public projects shall be made pursuant to the following competitive bidding procedures which follow in this article. The estimated value of purchases and contracts shall include sales tax and freight. 
(a)  Bidding waived based on estimated value. Purchases and contracts of an estimated value in the amount of $7,500.00 or less may be made without competitive process. 
(b)  Open market bidding procedures. Purchases and contracts of an estimated value in the amount of $45,000.00.00 or less may be made by open market bidding procedures pursuant to the provisions of Section 2-9.204 of this article, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(c)  Informal bidding procedures. Purchases and contracts of an estimated value in the amount of $175,000.00 or less may be made by informal bidding procedures pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2-9.205 and 2-9.206 of this article, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(d)  Formal bidding procedures. Purchases and contracts of an estimated value in an amount greater than $175,000.00 shall be made by formal bidding procedures pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2-9.205 and 2-9.207 of this article, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(e)  Exceptions. The bidding procedures and force account restrictions set forth in this article shall be dispensed with when bidding would be impossible, impractical, or incongruent; in an emergency; when the price is controlled by law; when the commodity, maintenance service, or project can only be provided or performed by one vendor (including in cases in which standardization of City equipment would result in savings to the City); or when the estimated value of the purchase or contract is $7,500.00 or less. For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Impossible" shall mean actual impossibility or extreme and unreasonable difficulty or expense. 
(2)  "Impractical" shall mean incapable of being performed by the bid procedure. 
(3)  "Incongruous" shall mean not suitable to the bid procedure. 
(4)  "Emergency" shall mean circumstances or conditions that pose an immediate threat to the public health, welfare, or safety as determined by the City Manager, including, but not limited to, states of emergency as defined in Section 8558 of the Government Code of the State. 
(f)  Cooperative agreements. No provision of this article shall be interpreted or construed to prohibit or prevent the City from purchasing or contracting for supplies, equipment, maintenance services, or Public Projects by contracts, arrangements, and agreements for cooperative purchasing programs not otherwise prohibited by law with any Federal government agency, the State, the County, the Simi Valley Unified School District, the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, any other public agencies, or with any cooperative purchasing alliance acting on behalf of governmental entities. Any such contract, agreement, or arrangement otherwise subject to open market or informal bidding procedures shall be first approved by the Purchasing Agent and if subject to formal bidding procedures shall be first approved by the City Council, or by the City Manager in accordance with the stated purchasing authorities set forth in this chapter. Cooperative multi-year agreements are allowed when initial year funding for ongoing requirements is provided in the budget and the City's agreement with the vendor allows the City to terminate the agreement without additional cost to the City if funding is subsequently not appropriated by the City Council. At the discretion of the appropriate approving authority, the bidding procedures of any agency may be used in such joint contracting arrangements. For purposes of this chapter, cooperative agreements include "piggyback" agreements under which a vendor with a currently operative contract with another public agency obtained through a competitive process agrees to provide the same supplies, equipment, maintenance services or Public Project work to the City at an equal or better price as that provided to the originating public agency. 
(g)  Purchasing cards. The Purchasing Agent may establish or continue a program for the use of purchasing cards to facilitate the purchase of goods and services by authorized individuals on behalf of the City. A purchasing card program shall adhere to the provisions of this chapter and to policies and procedures approved by the City Manager.

The City Council, by a four-fifths ( 4/5 ) vote, may delegate to the City Manager the power to declare a public emergency subject to confirmation by the City Council, by a four-fifths ( 4/5 ) vote, at its next meeting. The City Council shall review the emergency action every fourteen (14) days thereafter until the action is terminated, to determine, by a four-fifths ( 4/5 ) vote, that there is a need to continue the action. When the City Council reviews the emergency action, it shall terminate the action at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant so that the remainder of the emergency action may be completed by giving notice for bids to let contracts.

2-9.208 - Local business preference. 
The City recognizes that local businesses make significant contributions to the economic health of the City. The City supports local business opportunities, which encourage businesses to move into and stay within the City, promote economic development and maintain a strong local economic base, which in turn foster economic growth in the City. Therefore, the City Council has determined it is in the City's best interest to establish and provide a preference to local businesses. 
(a)  Competitive bid process. The City manager is authorized to extend a preference to a responsible and responsive local business in a competitive bid for the procurement of supplies, equipment, and materials not to exceed five (5%) percent of the local businesses total bid price, or $2,500.00, whichever is lower, for the purpose of determining the lowest bid. 
(b)  Local preference. When a non-local business has submitted the lowest responsive and responsible bid, and when one or more local businesses have also bid, the local business's total bid amount will be reduced by five (5%) percent for bid comparison purposes. If the net amount is lower than the lowest bid, the bid will be awarded to the local business for the full amount of its bid. 
(c)  Local business. For purposes of this chapter, "local business" means a vendor or contractor that has an office with at least one employee physically located within the City of Simi Valley, who possesses and shows evidence of a current business tax certificate issued by the City.

(3)  Contracts for services.

It is the intent of this article to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of sexually oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this article to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of sexually oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of sexually oriented businesses in certain areas.

The City Council finds that this chapter is enacted in order to mitigate the threat posed to the public peace, health, or safety by sexually oriented businesses. In this regard, the findings set forth in Section 1 of the ordinance codified in this chapter are incorporated herein by reference. This chapter provides for the amendment of existing regulations applicable to sexually oriented businesses and provides for zoning regulations which are specifically applicable to sexually oriented business uses. Such uses are already allowed under the City's existing zoning regulations. Therefore, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that this chapter may have a significant adverse effect on the environment, and therefore the adoption of said ordinance is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 15061 (b) (3) of the CEQA guidelines.

Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after any such transfer or assignment. Such consent of the Council may not be unreasonably refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee shall demonstrate financial responsibility as required by all the provisions of this chapter and approved by the City Council; and provided, further, no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except that when such hypothecation shall exceed fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the property used by the franchise in the operation of the cable television system, the prior consent of the Council shall be required for such a transfer.

Any such acquisition shall require the approval of the Council which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the termination of the franchise pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 5-10.05 of this chapter. 
(e)  In the event that any franchise granted pursuant hereto should become an asset in bankruptcy, and during the pendency of said proceeding the grantee fails to maintain service levels as required hereby and by all other applicable law or the franchise agreement, City may initiate termination or revocation of the franchise as provided herein without regard to said bankruptcy proceeding, nor shall said proceeding stay or delay in any way the franchise revocation process.

(d)  The failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the requirements of this section and to complete each of the matters set forth in this chapter shall be grounds for the termination of such franchise. By resolution the Council, at its discretion, may extend the time for the commencement and completion of the installation and construction for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond its control. 
Failure to comply with the time requirements herein shall subject Grantee to penalties of One Thousand and no/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars per day for each and every day's delay beyond the time prescribed.

(g)  In those areas of the City where the transmission or distribution of the respective public utilities providing telephone communication, and electric services are underground, or hereafter are placed underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground. The term "underground" shall include a partial underground system; amplifiers in the grantee's transmission and distribution lines may be placed in appropriate housings upon the surface of the ground. Should technological advances be made during the term of a grantee's franchise which would allow flush mounted equipment that would provide the same or better service than above ground housings, and at such time that such equipment becomes cost effective and practical for the grantee to provide, and upon mutual agreement of the City and the grantee, the grantee shall utilize such equipment in all new projects. Should such equipment become available under the circumstances noted above, the grantee shall also when upgrading or repairing cable in an existing development, replace above ground housings with flush mounted housings or other visually less obtrusive equipment. 
(h)  The grantee, at its expense, shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any property of the grantee when, in the opinion of the City Manager, the same is required by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacations, freeway or street construction, changes or establishment of street grades, and the installation of sewers, drains, waterpipes, power lines, signal lines, transportation facilities, tracks, or any other types of structures or improvements by governmental agencies, whether acting in a governmental or a proprietary capacity, or any other structure or public improvement, including, but not limited to, the movement of buildings, urban renewal and redevelopment, and any general program under which the City shall undertake to cause all such properties to be located beneath the surface of the ground.

Nothing set forth in this section shall be deemed a taking of the property of the grantee, and it shall be entitled to no surcharge by reason of anything set forth in this section. 
(i)  Grantee shall be provided reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure any alleged defect, however, upon the failure, refusal, or neglect of the grantee to cause any work or other act required by law, this chapter, or the franchise agreement to be properly completed in, on, over, or under any street within any time prescribed, the City Manager may cause such work or other act to be completed in whole or in part and, upon so doing, shall submit to the grantee an itemized statement of the costs thereof. The grantee shall, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such statement, pay to the City the entire amount thereof. 
(j)  In the event the use of any part of the system of the grantee is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of thirty (30) days, without prior written notice to and approval by the City; or any part of such system has been installed in any street or other area without complying with the requirements of this chapter, or if any franchise shall be terminated, cancelled, or shall expire, the grantee shall, at the option of the City, and at the expense of the grantee and at no expense to the City, and upon the demand of the City, promptly remove from any rights-of-way or other area, all the property of the grantee, and the grantee shall promptly restore the rights-of-way, or other area from which such property was removed to such condition as previously existed. 
The Council may, upon the written application therefor by the grantee, approve the abandonment of any of such property in place by the grantee and under such terms and conditions as the Council may prescribe. Upon the abandonment of any such property in place, the grantee shall cause to be executed, acknowledged, and delivered to the City such instruments as the City Attorney shall prescribe and approve transferring and conveying the ownership of such property to the City.

Chapter 15 - MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1287, § 2 (Exh. A), adopted March 5, 2018, effective April 5, 2018, repealed the former Chapter 15, §§ 5-15.015-15.25, and enacted a new Chapter 5-15 as set out herein. The former Chapter 5-15 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1263, effective December 5, 2016. 
 
5-15.01 - Findings and purpose. 
The City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(a)  The City is authorized, by virtue of the State Constitution and Section 51030 et seq. of the Government Code, to regulate the qualifications and licensing of massage service providers and massage establishments, and hereby does so for the benefit of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  The California State Legislature has implemented uniform statewide regulations pertaining to massage therapy and massage establishments (enacted by AB 2194 in 2016 and AB 1147 in 2014, superseding SB 731 in 2008 and AB 619 in 2011), now codified in Chapter 10.5 of Division 2 of the California Business and Professions Code at Section 4600 et seq. (the "Massage Therapy Act," or "MTA"), which created a statewide system for issuing massage worker permits, which generally preempts local regulation of the practice and technique of massage. The statewide permitting system is administered by the California Massage Therapy Council ("CAMTC"). 
(c)  As to massage establishments, the 2014 changes to the MTA allow the application of certain local land use, zoning, business licensing, and operational regulations. Additionally, local jurisdictions can establish reasonable health and safety requirements for massage establishments not in conflict with the MTA. To enable the City to carry out the local regulation and review of massage establishments and businesses, the City must enact and codify massage establishment and business regulations in the Simi Valley Municipal Code. 
(d)  There is a continued need for local regulations because there is significant risk of injury to massage patrons by improperly trained or educated massage service providers, and the City has a legitimate interest in providing reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss to such massage patrons. In addition, the City wishes to promote the ethical practice of massage therapy as an important healing art, and to prevent and discourage the misuse of massage therapy as a front for prostitution and other illicit activities in violation of the law, including, but not limited to, subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 647 of the California Penal Code. Local regulation is also necessary to prevent adverse secondary effects in the community such as blight, disease, litter, the deterioration of neighborhoods and commercial districts, and other secondary effects. 
(e)  The adoption of qualification standards for massage service providers by the CAMTC certification program established under the MTA and the enhancement of the City's reasonable regulations on the operation of massage establishments and the conduct of massage service providers will serve to reduce the risk of potentially injurious and illegal activity. 
(f)  It is the City Council's intent that strict liability apply to the owners/permittees, operators, responsible managing officers, and managers (whether permitted/licensed or not) and for them to be criminally liable for the operational requirements and conduct of all employees, operators, managers, agents, and independent contractors at or operating on the behalf of the business(es) required to be permitted for massage as outlined in Exhibit A, and as found in the cases People v. Bachrach (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8; and People v. Travers (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 111. Any violation of the municipal code sections in this chapter do not require proof of intent, criminal negligence or physical presence, but are governed by the rules of strict liability primarily concerned with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(g)  The provisions of this chapter are not intended to be exclusive, and compliance with this Title 5, Chapter 15 of the Simi Valley Municipal Code will not excuse noncompliance with any state or local laws or regulations that are uniformly applied to other professional or personal service businesses including zoning regulations, building, fire, electrical and plumbing codes, and health and safety laws and regulations applicable to professional or personal service businesses. 
(h)  The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any provision of this chapter or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

(b)  A permittee may apply for, and are responsible for, any renewal of a permit sixty (60) calendar days prior to the expiration of the permit. If a complete application for renewal is not received by the expiration date, the permit shall be deemed expired. Any permit issued under this chapter must be returned to the Chief of Police within forty-eight (48) hours of its expiration. No privilege to provide massage shall exist until an application for renewal has been granted. After a permit expires, a new application may be filed; however, all rules in place at the time of new application shall apply. 
(c)  Permits may be renewed by filing an application for renewal under penalty of perjury, and updating information and photograph(s) in the original application provided to the Chief of Police. 
(d)  Verification of continued certification, in good standing, from CAMTC, of all massage practitioners owning or working in any capacity with the massage establishment or off-premises massage business shall accompany the application for renewal. During the pendency of the renewal application, verification of CAMTC certification of all new massage practitioners hired by a massage establishment shall be submitted to the Chief of Police as a supplemental to the renewal application within ten (10) days of hiring, termination or resignation of a massage practitioner.

(g)  After investigating the application for renewal, the Chief of Police shall renew the permit if the permittee continues to meet the requirements for issuance of a permit, and none of the grounds for denial of a permit or permit renewal set forth in this chapter exist. The Chief of Police shall renew the permit within thirty (30) calendar days of such request if the information upon which the original application was granted remains materially unchanged and no violations of this chapter have been committed. The Chief of Police shall at his or her sole discretion optionally extend time in writing for the renewal investigation if required to make a determination of renewal or non-renewal. If such extension goes beyond the original expiration date of the permit, the permittee may continue operation until such time as the Chief of Police makes a determination on the application for renewal. 
(h)  Should the Chief of Police reasonably determine that an application for renewal presents materially and substantially new or different information compared to the expiring massage establishment permit or off-site massage permit, the Chief of Police may consider the existing massage establishment permit or off-premises massage business permit to have expired, and the permit holder shall then be required to file a new massage establishment permit or off-premises massage business permit application. Notice shall be given to the applicant of the determination of such expiration, and the applicant may appeal such determination of expiration pursuant to Section 5-15.17 of this chapter.

If such reasonable conditions cannot be imposed however, the Chief of Police shall deny an application for a permit required by this chapter only if the Chief of Police determines from the facts that: 
(a)  The person applying for the permit has failed to provide supplemental application information requested by the Chief of Police or has otherwise failed to complete the application;

(g)  The size and nature of the event combined with the reasonably available number of City police officers and other personnel is not sufficient to ensure the safety of the participants or the attending public; 
(h)  The event consists of a parade moving along a route which will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in three (3) hours or less; 
(i)  The location of the event will substantially interfere with construction or maintenance work previously scheduled to take place on or along the City street, parking facility, sidewalk or other public right-of-way to be occupied by the event; 
(j)  The event will occur at a time when a school is in session and along a route or at a location adjacent to the school or a class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the event will substantially disrupt the educational activity of such school or class; 
(k)  The decorative material on parade floats is not noncombustible or flame retardant or motorized parade floats and towing apparatus are not provided with a minimum 2-A, 10-B:C rated portable fire extinguisher readily accessible to the operator as provided in Uniform Fire Code Section 11.304;

In addition, such agreement shall provide that in the event a claim is made against the City by suit or otherwise, whether the same be groundless or not, arising out of such negligent or intentional act or omission, then the permittee shall defend the City and shall indemnify the City for any judgment rendered against it or any sums paid out in settlement or otherwise. Such agreement shall be filed with the Chief of Police prior to the issuance of the permit. 
(b)  Waiver of indemnification agreement. The indemnification agreement required by this section shall be waived by the Chief of Police for any permit authorizing an event involving an exercise of free speech rights.

Chapter 35 - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES* 
* Prior ordinance history: Ord. 901, effective September 4, 1997. 
 
5-35.01 - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for wireless telecommunication ("telecom") facilities on public and private property consistent with federal and state law while ensuring public safety, reducing the visual effects of telecom equipment on public streetscapes, protecting scenic views, and otherwise mitigating the impacts of such facilities. More specifically, the regulations contained herein are intended to: 
(1)  Encourage, but not require, the location of antennas on or adjacent to water tank sites owned by water purveyors; 
(2)  Encourage the location of antennas in nonresidential areas; 
(3)  Encourage co-location at new and existing antenna sites; 
(4)  Encourage telecom facilities to be located in areas where adverse impacts on the community and on public views are minimized. All telecom facilities shall be camouflaged to the greatest extent possible. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are not intended and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting telecom services. This chapter shall not be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent telecom services. 
(§ 2, Ord. 1103, eff. November 23, 2006)  
5-35.02 - General provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. These regulations are applicable to telecom facilities providing voice and/or data transmission such as, but not limited to, mobile telephone services, fixed microwave services, and mobile data services. 
(b)  Exempt facilities. Amateur radio antennas, antennas used solely for the purpose of receiving local broadcast stations, and satellite dish antennas of one meter in diameter or smaller are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  Permit required. Except for proposed antennas that exceed thirty-five (35') feet in height, an Encroachment Permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter by the Public Works Department shall be the only permit required for facilities located on water tank sites owned by water purveyors, provided such facilities meet the requirements of this chapter. A Telecommunication Permit issued in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall be required for all other telecommunications facilities. Telecommunication Permits shall be subject to review as follows: 
(1)  The Environmental Services Director shall have the authority to issue a permit for a wireless telecommunications facility that is proposed to be located in the public right-of-way or on private property when its design and installation is consistent with an Approved Telecommunications Facilities Design ("ATFD"), provided all other findings required by this chapter have been made. ATFDs shall be approved and periodically reviewed in the following manner: 
(i)  When the Planning Commission approves a wireless telecommunications facility in accordance with subsection (c)(2) below, it shall also determine if the design of the facility is eligible for approval as an ATFD. ATFDs shall be approved for facilities that are determined to constitute a standardized design (i.e., height, diameter of poles, screening or camouflaging, antenna placement, etc., as well as design, screening and placement of related equipment) that can thereafter be approved at the staff level. (For example, after approval of an ATFD for a proposed wireless telecommunications facility incorporated into a light pole in the public right-of-way, staff may thereafter approve similar proposed facilities, provided all other findings and requirements of this chapter are satisfied). 
(ii)  ATFDs shall be kept on file by the Environmental Services Department. ATFDs shall be subject to regular review by the Planning Commission on at least a biennial basis. Such review shall be to determine whether the ATFD is consistent with currently available designs and technologies, and to assure that wireless telecommunications facilities that are eligible for staff level approval are designed and installed in such a manner as to constitute the least intrusive design for such facilities. 
(2)  All wireless telecommunications facilities that are not on water tank sites or eligible for approval by the Environmental Services Director based upon an ATFD shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Required findings. The Reviewing Authority shall make all of the following findings when approving wireless telecommunications facilities: 
(1)  Higher priority locations or designs, as set forth in Section 5-35.04(b), are either not available or are not feasible; 
(2)  "Slim Jim" monopoles, new standard monopoles, or lattice towers shall only be permitted when they are determined to be the only necessary means available to provide service, and based upon findings consistent with subsections (d)(3) and (4) below; 
(3)  Lack of such a facility would result in a significant gap of coverage; 
(4)  The facility proposed would be of the least intrusive design and in the least intrusive location. 
(e)  Other regulations. All telecom facilities within the City shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and the following other requirements: 
(1)  Conditions in any permit or license issued by a local, state, or federal agency, which has jurisdiction over the telecom facility; 
(2)  Rules, regulations, and standards of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC); 
(3)  Easements, covenants, conditions, or restrictions on the underlying real property; 
(4)  The California Building Code, California Fire Code and portions of the Uniform Fire Code, California Mechanical Code, and California Electrical Code, as amended by state or local law or regulation. 
(f)  Regulations not in conflict or preempted. All telecom facilities within the City shall comply with any applicable design guidelines and standards, with the General Plan, with any applicable Specific Plan, and with the Simi Valley Municipal Code, unless specifically exempted by the provisions of this chapter. 
(g)  Setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured from the part of the telecom facility closest to the applicable lot line or structure. The setbacks requirements applicable in the public right-of-way shall be determined by the City Engineer based upon the safety needs of the location in order to assure Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access, traffic sight distance and related considerations. 
(h)  Maintenance. The telecom operator shall maintain the telecom facility in a manner consistent with the original approval of the facility. 
(i)  Non-conformities. A proposed telecom facility shall not create any new or increased non-conformities as defined in the Simi Valley Municipal Code, such as, but not limited to, a reduction in and/or elimination of, parking, setbacks, landscaping or loading zones. 
(j)  Technical consultants. At its discretion, the City may engage outside technical consultants to evaluate and/or verify the information used to support the applicant's showing(s) in its application or with testimony in City proceedings, and where applicable pursuant to this section. The reasonable cost for the consultants shall be borne by the applicant. 
An advance deposit for the estimated cost of the fees for the outside consultants shall be promptly paid to the City by the applicant upon request by the City. Failure to pay such deposit shall render any pending application incomplete until paid. After the consultants work has been completed, if the amount of the deposit was insufficient to cover the cost of the consultants' fees the applicant shall immediately reimburse the City for any shortfall. If the cost of the work is less than the estimate the amount over shall promptly be repaid to the applicant at the conclusion of the application proceedings.

(a)  Height. 
(1)  Maximum height. Except at water tank sites, thirty-five (35') feet for antennas on streetlights, traffic control standards, utility distribution poles, or other similar structures within the public right-of-way. Antennas exceeding thirty-five (35') feet in height at water tank sites may be approved by the Planning Commission provided they are found to be camouflaged, or otherwise screened from view. Antennas may be placed on existing utility poles that exceed thirty-five (35') feet, where the purpose of the existing utility pole is to carry electricity, provided that the top of the antenna shall not exceed six (6') feet above the top of the pole, and shall not exceed the height of the pole where primary or secondary electrical lines are attached to the pole. For legal nonconforming structures that exceed maximum building heights, telecom facilities may be installed so long as the addition does not increase the overall height and the project complies with this chapter in all other respects. For all other telecom facilities, the maximum height of antennas shall be the upper maximum building height allowed in the Simi Valley Municipal Code. 
(2)  Over-height antennas. The Planning Commission may approve antennas up to fifteen (15') feet above the preceding maximum building height limitations provided that it makes findings a, b, c, and d that are required for Special Approvals pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
(3)  " Camouflaged" telecommunication installations within structures. Camouflaged facilities may be installed within structures that are permitted to exceed the above stated height limits by a Conditional Use Permit. 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  Location or design categories and location priorities. When reviewing proposed locations for telecom facilities the Reviewing Authority shall utilize the following priority order: 
(i)  VCWWD water tank sites;

(iii)  Existing pole, light standard, or utility tower; 
(iv)  Commercial sign or architectural feature; 
(v)  New or existing "camouflaged" structure other than a false tree; 
(vi)  New false tree; 
(vii)  New "Slim Jim" monopole (i.e., a vertical antenna with no antenna elements other than the pole itself); 
(viii)  New standard monopole with attached antenna elements; 
(ix)  New lattice tower. 
(2)  Locations requiring special approval. Telecom facilities are prohibited in the following locations unless given Special Approval by the Planning Commission under the provisions of this chapter, after making all of the findings contained in subsection (b)(3) below: 
(i)  On common area lots, other non-residential lots, and public right-of-way within residential districts; 
(ii)  Within any required setback established in the Simi Valley Municipal Code; 
(iii)  On multifamily structures; 
(iv)  On public right-of-way where any portion of the proposed telecom facility lies adjacent to the property line of a residential structure. 
(3)  Special Approval findings. In making the following Special Approval findings the Planning Commission shall determine that the applicant has demonstrated that: 
(i)  Other locations do not require Special Approval or are either not available or not feasible; 
(ii)  Establishment of the facility at the requested location is necessary to provide service; 
(iii)  Lack of such a facility would result in a significant gap of coverage; and 
(iv)  The proposed site is the least intrusive location which can close that gap. 
(4)  Prohibited locations. Telecom facilities are prohibited on undeveloped residential lots or residential lots containing single-family residences. 
(c)  Available technology. All telecom facilities approved under this chapter shall utilize the most efficient and diminutive available technology in order to minimize the number of facilities and reduce their visual impact. 
(d)  Co-location requirements. 
(1)  Co-location required. To limit the adverse visual effects of a proliferation of telecom sites in the City, a new telecom facility proposed within one thousand (1,000') feet of an existing facility shall be required to co-locate on the same site as the existing facility unless the Reviewing Authority determines, based on evidence submitted by the applicant, that such co-location is not feasible. 
(2)  Co-location limitations. Except at water tank sites, no more than three (3) telecom facilities may co-locate at a single site unless the Reviewing Authority finds that: 
(i)  The net visual effect of locating an additional facility at a co-location site will be less than establishing a new location; or 
(ii)  Based on evidence submitted by the applicant, there is no available feasible alternate location for a proposed new facility. 
(3)  Future co-location. In approving a telecom facility, the Reviewing Authority may impose a condition of approval allowing future co-location of telecom facilities by other carriers at the same site, subject to numerical limits it deems to be appropriate that are necessary in order to be consistent with the required finding that the design be the least intrusive. 
(4)  Least intrusive location standard. The Reviewing Authority must find that the proposed site is the least intrusive location which can close a significant gap in coverage. 
(§ 2, Ord. 1103, eff. November 23, 2006)  
5-35.05 - Design standards. 
(a)  General criteria. In addition to the other design standards of this section, all of the following criteria shall be applied by the Reviewing Authority in connection with the processing of any Telecommunication Permit. 
(1)  Roof-mounted antennas shall be screened from view from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way. The screening may include parapets, walls, or similar architectural elements provided that they are designed, colored and texturized to integrate with the existing architecture of the building. 
(2)  When located on a building facade, building-mounted antennas shall be recessed and covered with an RF-transparent and visually opaque material of a color and texture to match the existing building, or effectively disguised as may be reasonably determined by the Planning Commission.

Chapter 36 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
 
5-36.101 - Purpose. 
Over the past several years, various neighborhoods and areas in the City have witnessed a marked decline in the maintenance and appearance of a number of parcels of real property. These deteriorated properties have become eyesores, have adversely affected adjacent property values, and have had a negative impact on the quality of life in the City. This chapter is intended to address egregious cases of inadequate property maintenance while balancing that effort with the rights of the owners of private property. In pursuit of that intent, this chapter is to establish enforceable minimum maintenance standards for single-family residential, multi-residential, commercial, and industrial properties for each of the following purposes: 
(a)  To enhance and promote the maintenance of real property, improve the liveability, appearance, and the social and economic conditions of the community; 
(b)  To ensure that real properties do not reach a state of deterioration or disrepair so as to cause the depreciation of the value of surrounding property or be materially detrimental to nearby properties and improvements; and 
(c)  To establish standards for property maintenance that reasonably relate to the proper exercise of police power to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.

Chapter 39 - AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION 
 
5-39.01 - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The City Council finds that the instances of aggressive solicitation in the City has become extremely disturbing and has the potential to be disruptive to residents and businesses, and contributes not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(b)  Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The City Council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit vehicles can be especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments. 
(c)  The City Council is enacting this chapter pursuant to its police power, as stated in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, in addition to the power set forth in Section 647(c) of the State of California Penal Code. This law is timely and appropriate because current laws and City regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. 
(d)  The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that has the potential to become an unwelcome presence in the City. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1048, eff. November 27, 2003)  
5-39.02 - Definitions.

(§ 1, Ord. 1048, eff. November 27, 2003)  
5-39.03 - Prohibited acts.

(§ 1, Ord. 1048, eff. November 27, 2003)  
Chapter 40 - HOSTING GATHERINGS OF UNDERAGE DRINKERS 
 
5-40.01 - Findings. 
(a)  Underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises is harmful to the underage persons themselves and a threat to the peace, health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare of the public. Underage persons, who have been consuming alcoholic beverages, are at greater risk to be in automobile accidents, to commit suicide, to be assaulted, and to suffer sexual assaults. 
(b)  Persons responsible for the occurrence of these types of gathering on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these parties. 
(c)  Problems associated with gatherings involving underage persons drinking alcohol are difficult to prevent and deter. Police need effective tools to deal with the issue of underage drinking and its attendant problems. If persons are held civilly responsible by having to pay a fine for hosting a party where there is underage drinking, they will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such conduct at events held on property under their possession or control. 
(d)  In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to these types of gatherings. The repeated return of police officers to the location of an event constitutes a drain of emergency personnel and resources, often leaving other areas of the City without police protection or with unreasonably limited protection. Responses to such gatherings also result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City of Simi Valley, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the City by its taxpayers and residents. 
(§ 1 (part), Ord. 1093, eff. July 5, 2006)  
5-40.02 - Purpose. 
(a)  To enforce laws prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons; 
(b)  To protect public health, safety, general welfare and quiet enjoyment of residential property and properties neighboring one of these gatherings; and 
(c)  To establish standards and controls of parties, gatherings or assemblages involving underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages on private property.

(e)  The parents or guardians of a juvenile found to have hosted a gathering of underage drinkers may also request to have that juvenile serve forty (40) hours of community service as described in subsection (d) of this section, and pay City administrative fees, if any, as an alternative penalty to paying the civil penalty of One Thousand and No/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars.

Chapter 42 - PLACING FLIERS, HANDBILLS, LEAFLETS, AND OTHER PRINTED MATERIAL ON VEHICLES PROHIBITED 
 
5-42.01 - Findings, purpose and intent. 
The City Council finds and declares that: 
(a)  Privately owned vehicles, even when parked on public streets, are not public forums and therefore the placement of fliers, handbills, leaflets, and other printed material on them may be regulated by the City by reasonable time, place and manner regulations, so long as such regulations meet legal requirements. 
(b)  The intent of this chapter is to advance the City's significant governmental interests in prohibiting litter and visual blight, as well as furthering the rights that vehicle owners have in their private property to be left alone by those who do not have permission to use it. The City Council finds and determines that the prohibition contained in this chapter directly advances these interests in a narrow constitutionally permissible way by targeting the problem it seeks to correct. 
(c)  The City Council further finds and determines that the prohibition on placing fliers, handbills, leaflets, and other printed material on vehicles leaves open ample alternative channels of communications in that such material may still be offered to pedestrians and others who may choose to accept it or not accept it. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1131, eff. June 12, 2008)  
5-42.02 - Placing fliers, handbills, leaflets, and other printed material on vehicles prohibited. 
It shall be unlawful for any person, either directly or indirectly, to distribute, deposit, throw or place any flier, handbill, leaflet, or other printed material on any automobile or other vehicle. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit the handing, transmitting or distributing of any flier, handbill, leaflet, or other printed material to the owner or other occupant of any automobile or other vehicle who is willing to accept it. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1131, eff. June 12, 2008)  
Chapter 44 - CONDUCT ON PUBLIC PROPERTY 
 
5-44.01 - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Public streets, sidewalks, walkways, parking lots, plazas and other public areas are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians and vehicles to safely and efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing all potential customers and visitors with convenient access to goods and services, as well as a place to recreate and engage in free public speech in shared civic space. 
(b)  Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled, and vision-impaired, are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around hazards, hindrances or obstructions on public streets, alleys, sidewalk, crosswalks or other public areas. 
(c)  The purpose of this chapter is to maintain public streets, sidewalks and other developed and undeveloped areas within the city in a clean, safe and accessible condition for residents and the public at large; and to discourage or prevent crime, visual blight, poor sanitation and disease.

This section shall not apply to: Property or items that can promptly and safely be transported or removed all at once within three (3) minutes, provided a person with ownership or possession of such property is immediately adjacent to such property; property left on public sidewalks or streets for refuse or recycling collection by City-authorized third parties with which the person leaving such property has an existing fee service arrangement; property temporarily placed on the sidewalk or street during the active process of loading or unloading for some other lawful purpose, but only during the minimum reasonable amount of time for the active loading and unloading to occur; property left temporarily on the sidewalk during activities otherwise permitted on the sidewalk as a matter of law, provided a person with ownership or possession of such property is immediately adjacent to such property; or property for which there is reasonable evidence or indicia that the person to whom the property belongs is without a fixed place of address, homeless or otherwise has not secured permanent housing ("specific personal property"). 
In the case of specific personal property which would otherwise be in violation of this section, before specific personal property is removed, a written notice ("notice") shall be securely attached to the specific personal property or otherwise placed in close proximity to the specific personal property which notice shall: (i) state that the specific personal property will be collected and stored pursuant to law unless it is removed by the time of expiration of the notice period; (ii) identify the City contact by address and telephone number where the specific personal property may be retrieved; (iii) state that no identification is required to retrieve the specific personal property, except for prescription medications, which require valid identification; and (iv) state that the specific personal property may be picked up free of charge and without a ticket, fine or citation solely due to the abandonment or placement in the public area of the specific personal property. Only one notice need be placed per collection of specific personal property that is contained within a twenty (20) foot radius. After the notice has been attached or placed pursuant to this section for at least forty-eight (48) hours, the property may be removed pursuant to subsection (b), below. The post-removal notice for specific personal property, in addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (b), should include the requirements for Notice set forth in (ii)(iv) of this subsection (a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any specific personal property which is obstructing the right-of-way in a public area may be moved up to twenty (20) feet by the City to remove the obstruction; if a movement of up to twenty (20) feet cannot reasonably clear the obstruction, the City may immediately collect the property according to subsection (b) and provide the post-removal notice as set forth in this paragraph. Further, any specific personal property that is liquid or solid waste, or otherwise presents an imminent threat to the public health or safety, may be immediately removed by City. 
(b)  Such personal property described in subsection (a) may be removed from the public area by the City or its contractors if the owner of such personal property is not present or, if present, is otherwise unable to remove the personal property within three (3) minutes. At the time of removal of said personal property, a notice of such removal shall be given to the owner and/or placed at the location from where such personal property was removed. Such personal property shall be processed by the City pursuant to Title 2, Chapter 13 of this Code (Section 2-13.01 et seq.). 
(§ 6, Ord. No. 1283, eff. February 8, 2018)  
5-44.03 - Unattended packages. 
No person may intentionally leave any package, box or container within a public area of a public building or within twenty (20) feet of the exterior any public building, and thereafter depart and not remain within immediate reach of such item, unless that person is a member of a recognized or established delivery, postal or courier service or otherwise acting on behalf of or at the behest of the City or other governmental agency. In the case of specific personal property as defined in Section 5-44.02(a), the items may be immediately removed and the procedures set forth in Section 5-44.02(a) shall be followed, including a post-removal notice. Removal of such property by the City may take place pursuant to the method described in Section 5-44.02(b). 
(§ 6, Ord. No. 1283, eff. February 8, 2018)

For the purposes of this chapter, Section 4432 of the Ventura County Code is hereby amended to read as follows: 
  Sec. 4432. Disposal of Impounded Animals Other than Livestock. The Poundmaster shall feed and care for any animal impounded as provided in this chapter until such animal is disposed of as provided by law. If such animal is a dog which is not a "diseased or injured animal", as defined in this chapter, and is not being isolated pursuant to Article 4 of this chapter, the person owning such impounded dog may redeem it at any time within seventy-two (72) hours after it is taken up by describing it, proving ownership to the satisfaction of the Poundmaster, paying all applicable fees, and obtaining, when necessary, the dog license required by Section 4411 of this chapter. In computing the seventy-two (72) hours of such redemption period, the twenty-four (24) hours of any calendar day during which the Pound is not open to the public for the purposes of redeeming animals shall not be counted. When the Poundmaster knows the address of the owner of an impounded dog, the seventy-two (72) hours for redemption shall begin when written notice of such impounding is deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to such address. However, an owner may waive the seventy-two (72) hour redemption period in writing. If the impounded dog bears a license tag issued under the provisions of this chapter, such notice shall be mailed to the address shown on the copy of the receipt for such license tag on file in the County Animal Control office. If any dog impounded as provided in this chapter is not so redeemed within such seventy-two (72) hours, or if the owner of such dog is unknown to the Poundmaster or refuses to comply with any of the requirements of redemption as provided herein, or if the owner has waived the redemption period in writing, such dog shall be deemed to be abandoned, and the Poundmaster shall dispose of such dog according to the provisions of this Code. In disposing of an impounded animal, the Poundmaster, in his discretion, may destroy the animal in a humane manner, or he may sell such animal for a pet to any person who obtains such license as may be required by this chapter and signs a written agreement to feed the animal and provide it with a good home, or the Poundmaster may sell such animal to a State-chartered humane society. When an animal is returned to the Pound within ten (10) days after such sale, the buyer or other person returning the animal shall not be given the discretion to determine what disposition shall be made of the animal. The price to be charged for any animal sold as a pet or to any State-chartered humane society shall be as prescribed by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. 
(§ 2, Ord. 482, eff. August 26, 1981)  
6-1.403 - Amendments: Section 4432-1: Deposit of Neutering and Spaying Costs. 
For the purposes of this chapter, Section 4432-1 of the Ventura County Code is hereby amended to read as follows: 
  Sec. 4432-1. Deposit of Neutering and Spaying Costs. No dog capable of reproduction shall be sold by the Poundmaster pursuant to Section 4432 of this chapter unless the person purchasing the dog has first signed a written promise to cause the dog to be neutered or spayed on or before a specified deadline and has first deposited with the Poundmaster for application towards the cost of such neutering or spaying the amount of Ten and no/100ths ($10.00) Dollars, in the case of a male dog, or Twenty and no/100ths ($20.00) Dollars, in the case of a female dog. The specified deadline shall be the 180th day after such purchase or the day estimated by the Poundmaster to be the day on which the dog will attain the age of nine (9) months, in the case of a male dog, or seven (7) months, in the case of a female dog, whichever day is later in time. The deposit shall be nonrefundable but may be transferred at any time prior to the specified deadline upon showing satisfactorily to the Poundmaster that the original dog is either dead or too ill to undergo the operation on or before such deadline. Upon the written verification of a licensed veterinarian that the veterinarian has neutered or spayed the dog on or before the deadline, the entire amount of the deposit shall be forwarded to the veterinarian to be applied toward the veterinarian's fee for such operation or to be disposed of in such other manner as the veterinarian and the person who made the deposit may agree.

 (g) The chasing of pedestrians, vehicles, or ridden horses which occurs off the property of the owner or keeper of the chasing animal. 
 Such public nuisance may be abated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 4467-1 through 4467-10. Such procedures are in addition to any other remedies which may be available under the law. 
  Sec. 4467-1. Complaints. Any person aggrieved by such public nuisance may file a complaint with the Poundmaster. Such complaint shall be in writing, shall be signed by and bear the address of the complainant, shall state the place or places where such nuisance exists, shall describe the animal and the conduct which renders it a nuisance, and shall give the name and address of the animal's owner or keeper, if known to the complainant. 
  Sec. 4467-2. Notices. Upon the receipt of a complaint which alleges a public nuisance, or as soon thereafter as the Poundmaster may learn the name and address of the owner or keeper of the animal, the Poundmaster shall serve notice of a hearing upon the owner or keeper and upon the complainant. The notice shall be in writing and may be served either by personal delivery of a copy or by depositing a copy in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the person to be served. The notice shall do the following: 
 (a) Include a copy of the complaint; 
 (b) State that a hearing will be held to determine whether the animal described in the complaint is a nuisance within the meaning of Section 4467 and, if so, that the nuisance may be abated as provided in Sections 4467-1 through 4467-10; 
 (c) State the time, which shall be not less than fifteen (15) calendar days after the notice, and the place of the hearing; and 
 (d) Include a copy of Sections 4467 through 4467-10. 
  Sec. 4467-3. Impoundment Pending Hearings. If it appears to the Poundmaster from the complaint or other information available to him or her that the animal is being kept or maintained in a manner which poses an imminent threat to the safety of persons or property, the Poundmaster may impound the animal immediately and may hold the animal until findings are issued pursuant to Section 4467-9, at which time the animal shall be disposed of as provided in Article 2 of this chapter; provided, however, if the findings are that the animal is not a nuisance, the owner or keeper may redeem the animal without payment of the impound fees; and provided, further, if the order is that the animal be destroyed, the Poundmaster shall hold the animal for an additional seventy-two (72) hours and then shall destroy it in a humane manner. 
  Sec. 4467-4. Hearings. The hearing shall be public and shall be held before the Poundmaster at the time and place noticed or at such other time or place as may be mutually agreed to by the Poundmaster, the complainant, and the owner or keeper of the animal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Poundmaster may continue the hearing to such time and place as may be reasonably necessary for the convenience of witnesses or other parties. Failure of the owner or keeper of the animal to appear at the hearing or any continuance thereof shall constitute a default. 
  Sec. 4467-5. Oaths. The Poundmaster shall have the power to administer oaths or affirmations when necessary in conjunction with the hearing. 
  Sec. 4467-6. Evidence. Oral evidence need not be taken under oath or affirmation, unless either the owner or keeper of the animal or the complainant so requests, and it appears that the witness has a motive for being untruthful. Testimony may be given in an informal narrative style. The complainant, the owner or keeper of the animal, and the Poundmaster shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross-examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though such matter was not covered on direct examination, and to impeach any witness, regardless of which party first called the witness to testify. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence or objection in a civil action. Hearsay evidence shall be admissible for any purpose but shall not be sufficient itself to support a finding, unless it would be admissible over objection in a civil action. 
  Sec. 4467-7. Subpoena Powers. Before the hearing has commenced, the Poundmaster shall, at the request of the complainant or the owner or keeper of the animal, issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum for attendance or production of documents at the hearing. Compliance with the provisions of Section 1985 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. After the hearing has commenced, the Poundmaster may issue such subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum as he or she deems proper. Any person duly subpoenaed to appear and testify, or to produce any books and papers before the Poundmaster, who wrongfully neglects or refuses to appear or to testify or to produce such books and papers shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
  Sec. 4467-8. Records. The Poundmaster shall record the hearing on a recording device and shall make such recording available to the complainant and to the owner or keeper of the animal upon request. The Poundmaster shall provide a copy of the recording or a transcript prepared therefrom to any party who requests it and pays the cost of making such copy or preparing such transcript. 
  Sec. 4467-9. Findings and Orders. At the conclusion of the hearing, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Poundmaster shall make a written finding that the animal either is or is not a public nuisance as defined in Section 4467. Such finding shall be supported by the weight of the evidence presented at the hearing; provided that: 
 (a) If no evidence is presented, the finding shall be that the animal is not a public nuisance, unless 
 (b) the owner or keeper of the animal has defaulted by failing to appear, in which case the finding shall be that the animal is a public nuisance. 
 If the finding is that the animal is a public nuisance, the Poundmaster shall determine what actions, up to and including the humane destruction of the animal, are reasonably necessary in order to abate the nuisance and shall make and enter an order that the keeper of the animal take all such actions within such time limits as the order may prescribe. The findings and order shall be final when issued and shall be served promptly on the owner or keeper of the animal, either by personal delivery of a copy or by depositing a copy in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner or keeper. 
  Sec. 4467-10. Failure to Comply with Orders. Failure of the owner or keeper of the animal to take any action required of him or her by the order of the Poundmaster within the applicable time limit specified in the order shall be a misdemeanor and/or infraction; provided, however, that humane destruction of the animal within such time limit shall be deemed compliance with she order, regardless of the abatement action specified in the order. Each day or portion thereof that such noncompliance continues after such time limit shall be a separate offense. The Poundmaster may seize and summarily destroy any animal being kept or maintained in violation of such order of the Poundmaster.

Chapter 13 - SEWER USE  
Article 1. - General Provisions 
 
6-13.101 - Purpose. 
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect use of the wastewater collection and treatment system of the City to comply with all applicable federal and state standards required by the Clean Water Act of 1977, and all related and applicable federal, state, or local regulations and grant conditions, as they are now constituted, or as they may hereafter be amended or recodified. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.102 - Objectives. 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
(a)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that will interfere with its operation; 
(b)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; 
(c)  To protect both POTW personnel, who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment, and the public; 
(d)  To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the POTW; 
(e)  To provide for equitable distribution of the total cost of the City's sewerage system and all related programs through the establishment of fair and equitable fees, charges, and penalties; 
(f)  To regulate direct and indirect users of the City's sewerage system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for all other users; 
(g)  To provide for monitoring and enforcement activities; and 
(h)  To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, sludge and/or biosolids use and disposal requirements, and any other federal, state, or local laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.103 - Policy. 
The City protects the health, welfare, and safety of the local residents, City employees, and the environment by constructing, operating, and maintaining a system of local sewers, trunk sewers and interceptors, and liquid waste treatment and disposal facilities that service the homes, industries, and commercial establishments throughout the City and surrounding environments as required by federal, state, and local law. The following basic policies apply to sanitary sewage, liquid waste, and industrial and process wastewater discharged into the sewerage system and disposal works of the City. 
(a)  The highest priority and best use of the sewerage system is the collection, treatment, and reclamation or disposal of sanitary sewage. The use of the sewerage system for industrial and process wastewater discharges is subject to regulation by the City. 
(b)  In accordance with the policies and goals of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 USC 13101 et seq.) and the Hazardous Waste Source Reduction and Management Review Act of 1989 (California Health and Safety Code Section 25244.12, et seq.), industry is urged to seek source reduction, waste minimization, pollution prevention, and/or recovery and reuse procedures to meet the limitations set on industrial and process wastewater discharges rather than those procedures designed solely to meet discharge limitations. 
(c)  The City is committed to a policy of wastewater reclamation and reuse in order to provide an alternate source of water supply and to reduce overall costs of wastewater treatment and disposal. The reclamation of wastewater through wastewater treatment processes may necessitate more stringent quality requirements on industrial and process wastewater discharges as the demand for reclaimed water increases. Optimum use of City facilities may require the discharge of wastewaters during periods of low flow in the sewerage system as established by the City. 
(d)  Provisions are made in this chapter to regulate industrial and process wastewater discharges, to comply with federal and state government requirements and policies and to meet increasingly higher standards of treatment plant effluent quality and environmental considerations. This chapter establishes quantity and quality limitations on sanitary sewage, liquid waste, and industrial and process wastewater discharges where such discharges may adversely affect the sewerage system or the effluent quality. It is the intent of these limitations to improve the quality of wastewater being received for treatment and to encourage water conservation by all users connected to a public sewer. It is the City's policy to discourage an increase in the quantity or mass emission of waste pollutants being discharged. This chapter also provides for regulation of the degree of wastewater pretreatment required, the issuance of permits for industrial and process wastewater discharge, connections, and other miscellaneous permits and the establishment of penalties for violations of the chapter. 
(e)  Cost recovery methods are established where industrial and process wastewater discharges impose collection system treatment or disposal costs on the City, which are unfair and/or inequitable to all users of the system. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.104 - Availability of sewerage facilities. 
If sewerage capacity is not available, the Director may restrict discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available. When requested, the Director may advise industrial wastewater users desiring to locate new facilities as to the areas where wastewater of their quantity and quality can be received by available sewerage facilities. The Director may refuse immediate service to new facilities where their proposed quantity or quality of wastewater would not meet the standards of this chapter. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.105 - Sampling requirements. 
All wastewater analysis is to be performed by a State Department of Public Health approved laboratory by the appropriate procedures set forth in 40 CFR 136. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.106 - General record keeping requirements. 
All users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter must retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs. Records must include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records must remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.107 - Notices to employees. 
In order that employees of users are informed of City requirements, users must make available to their employees copies of this chapter and other wastewater and pollution prevention information and notices, which were furnished by the City. A legible, understandable, and conspicuously placed notice must be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to notify the Director immediately in the event of an uncontrolled discharge and to provide the information listed below. In the event a majority of the user's employees use a language other than English as a primary language, the user must have the notice worded in both English and the primary language(s) involved. The notice must set forth the current phone number of the Director and must identify the following as the minimum necessary information that is to be provided to the Director: 
(a)  Time, location, type, concentration, volume, and cause, if known, of the discharge. 
(b)  Corrective action taken.

(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
Article 7. - Facilities Requirements 
 
6-13.701 - Separation of sanitary sewage and industrial and process wastewaters. 
All sanitary sewage must be kept separate from all industrial and process wastewaters until the industrial and process wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment facility and monitoring device. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.702 - Pretreatment of industrial and process wastewaters. 
The Director may require an industrial wastewater pretreatment facility or device when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge to the sewer of certain waste pollutants or to accomplish any specific pretreatment result required by the Director prior to discharge to the sewer. The Director may also require a pretreatment facility or device when necessary to redistribute any peak discharges of industrial wastewaters over a longer time period. Any facilities necessary for compliance must be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. All pretreatment facilities or devices must be approved by the Director, but such approval shall not absolve the user of the responsibility of meeting any required industrial effluent limitation(s) required. The director may require construction of sewer lines by the user to convey certain industrial wastes to a specific City trunk sewer. All pretreatment facilities judged by the City to require engineering design must have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline and licensed in the State of California a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of Discharge. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures, including accidental discharge procedures, must be submitted to the Director for review. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Director will not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility in the future, as necessary, to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. 
A gravity separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber, control manhole, sampling location, or other approved device may be required to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flows, and to facilitate inspection, flow measurement, and sampling. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.703 - Dilution. 
No user shall ever increase the use of water or in any other manner attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate methods for the reduction of pollutants to achieve compliance with the permit or this chapter unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.704 - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  Any user, at the discretion of the Director, shall be required to install and maintain monitoring facilities or devices to allow inspection, sampling, or measurements in the facility sewer or plumbing systems and shall also be required to provide, install, and operate sampling or monitoring equipment at the user's expense. These facilities must be situated on the user's premises. However, the Director may allow monitoring facilities to be constructed off-premises at the user's expense. 
(b)  All users making periodic measurements must furnish and install at their own expense at the sampling well or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter, or similar device approved by the Director and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow indicator, recorder, or totalizing register may be required by the Director. In lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the Director may accept records of water usage to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial wastewater discharge. A suitable calibration schedule must be approved by the Director. 
(c)  When one or more users discharge into a common sewer, the Director may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each user. Also, when in the judgment of the Director, there is a significant difference in wastewater pollutants and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Director may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. A combined waste stream formula may be applied. 
(d)  If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fences, there must be accommodations to allow access for City personnel. There must be ample operating area in or near such sampling points and equipment to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The user must assure that access and sampling and measuring equipment are maintained in a safe and proper operating condition. 
(e)  The sampling and monitoring facilities must be installed in accordance with the City's design requirements and all applicable construction standards, safety devices, and specifications. Construction must be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification from the City. 
(f)  The user must provide written notification to the Director upon completion of the sampling and monitoring facilities. 
(g)  Monitoring or metering facilities must be provided with a security closure that can be locked with a City provided lock during sampling or monitoring. 
(h)  Unrestricted access to monitoring facilities must be available to authorized City personnel at all times. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.705 - Grease interceptors for fats, oil, grease, and solids. 
(a)  Food service facilities. All food service facilities discharging grease wastes which, under the conditions existing in the downstream sewers, could cause or threaten to cause stoppage or grease accumulations, shall be required to install an appropriately sized and approved grease interceptor and to regularly maintain it so as to prevent excessive discharges of fats, oil, grease, and solids into the sewerage system. A grease interceptor must not have garbage disposals or dishwashers installed that discharge to the grease trap. Any design for installation of any grease interceptor must be approved in accordance with the requirements of the Building Code. The grease interceptor must be easily accessible for inspection by the Director. Exceptions to the installation of a grease interceptor shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Director based on the following criteria: 
(1)  Size of facility; 
(2)  Number of meals served per day; 
(3)  Type of food prepared; 
(4)  Seating capacity; 
(5)  Location; 
(6)  Dishwashing activities; and 
(7)  Garbage facilities. 
(b)  Existing grease interceptors. Grease interceptors properly installed at a food service facility prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be acceptable as an alternative to the grease interceptor specified in subsection (a) of this section provided such grease interceptor is effective in removing fats, oil, grease, and solids and is designed and installed so that it can be inspected and properly maintained. If the Director determines that a grease interceptor is incapable of retaining adequately the settleable and floatable material in the wastewater flow from a food service facility, a written notice may be issued requiring that an adequate grease interceptor be installed within ninety (90) days. 
(c)  Variances on grease interceptor sizing. Grease interceptors must meet or exceed a minimum size standard of 750-gallon capacity, except when a written variance is granted by the Director. Facilities may apply for a sizing variance to a minimum 70-pound capacity grease interceptor, commonly known as a grease trap, in accordance with this chapter. Grease interceptor sizing variances may be granted by the Director when the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The user applies for the variance, in writing, and includes the volume of all fixtures; and 
(2)  The sizing of a grease interceptor is calculated based on the total discharge flow rate and must be certified by a qualified engineer registered in the State of California to be sufficient to pre-treat the volume and type of wastewater. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.706 - Car washes, vehicle service facilities and garages. 
All new car washes, vehicle service facilities, and garages that have facilities for the wash down of vehicles must install an appropriate sand and oil interceptor of a size and design approved by the Director. Establishments in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter must install an appropriate sand and oil interceptor if the establishment has the potential of contributing non-compatible materials to the sewerage system. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.707 - Existing sand and oil interceptor. 
Sand and oil interceptors properly installed at a vehicle service facility, garage, car wash, or similar establishment prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be acceptable as an alternative to the sand and oil interceptor specified in Section 6-13.706 provided such sand and oil interceptor is effective in removing sand, oil, and solids and is designed and installed so that it can be inspected and properly maintained. If the Director determines that a sand and oil interceptor is incapable of retaining adequately the settleable and floatable material in the wastewater flow from a vehicle service facility, garage, car wash, or similar establishment, a written notice shall be issued requiring that an adequate sand and oil interceptor be installed within ninety (90) days. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.708 - Approved designs. 
The City maintains an information file, available for public use, of acceptable designs of grease interceptors, and sand and oil interceptors. The installation of a grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor of a design shown in such a file, or of any design meeting the requirements set forth in this section or any recommendation or requirements made by the City, shall not impute any liability to the City for the adequacy of the grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor under the actual conditions of use. The Director may require the installation of a sample box with the grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor. The design of such installations must be completed and stamped by an engineer of suitable discipline registered in the State of California. Such installation shall not relieve the owner or proprietor of responsibility for keeping fat, oil, grease, and solids out of the sewer. If the grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor or other Pretreatment device is not adequate under the conditions of use, one must be constructed which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.709 - Maintenance of grease interceptors or sand and oil interceptors. 
Any grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor required by this chapter must be readily accessible for inspection and properly maintained to ensure that the accumulations of fats, oil, grease, and solids do not impair the efficiency of the Grease Interceptor or escape with the effluent. All locations required to use and maintain a grease interceptor must keep a record of every cleaning and maintenance event. This record must include the date, the name of the company or person who cleaned it, and disposal site of the waste. A grease interceptor shall not be considered properly maintained if fats, oil, grease, and solids accumulations total twenty-five (25%) percent or more of the operating fluid capacity of the final chamber. The City will inspect all grease interceptors and sand and oil interceptors periodically. If a grease interceptor or sand and oil interceptor is found to be improperly maintained or adequate records are not being kept, an initial notice of violation will be issued to the owner and/or user of the property pursuant to Section 6-13.903.

Those users required by the Director to make periodic measurements of industrial wastewater flows and pollutants must make at least the minimum number of measurements required. The minimum requirement for periodic measurements shall be at least two 24-hour measurements per year. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Representative samples of the industrial wastewater shall be obtained at least once each hour over the 24-hour period, or the designated hours of operation for the facility. All samples must be properly refrigerated and preserved, composited according to measured flow rates during the 24-hour period, and analyzed for the specified wastewater pollutants. Industrial plants with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for every working day. When required by the Director, users must install and maintain, in proper working order, automatic flow-proportional sampling equipment, automatic analysis and recording equipment, or both. 
Measurements to verify the quantities of waste flows and waste pollutants reported by users will be conducted on a random basis by the Director.

Samples and flow measurement must represent the normal wastewater flow to the public sewer over a twenty-four (24) hour period. Composite samples shall be collected according to flow or time, with at least one sample collected hourly. Samples may be collected either manually or by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the Director. Chain-of-custody logs must be maintained by the user for all samples required by this chapter. 
(a)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(b)  The sampling, handling, storage, and analysis of all samples taken for the determination of the characteristics of wastewater discharges must be performed in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, by laboratories certified by the State of California, by a laboratory of the user approved by the Director. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures approved by EPA. If performed by City personnel, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the user requesting the tests. Prior to submittal to the Director of data developed in the laboratory of a user, the results must be verified by an authorized representative of the user, certified to by a qualified professional, and signed by an authorized representative of the user. Any independent laboratory or user performing tests must immediately furnish any required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used upon request by the Director. 
(c)  Except as indicated in subsections (d) and (e) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and approved EPA procedures, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits. 
(d)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sample techniques. 
(e)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities with historical sampling data available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 6-13.812(d) the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements.

(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.903 - Non-compliance with permit requirements. 
Upon discovery by the Director of non-compliance with any permit requirement, an initial notice of violation (INOV) or notice of violation (NOV) shall be issued to the user. The violation notice must indicate the nature of the non-compliance, the required actions to comply, and the time frames in which compliance must be reached. The INOV may be issued for the first minor violation of a user. The NOV will be issued for subsequent violations, violations that are of a more serious nature, or where the user has had repeated violations. Notification does not preclude the Director from taking any other enforcement action authorized by this chapter. 
(a)  First violation. The Director may issue an initial notice of violation. 
(b)  Second and subsequent violations. A user will be issued a NOV for a second and any subsequent violations within a 12-month period and may be punishable by the enforcement actions set forth in this chapter and a fine or penalty in an amount set forth by resolution adopted by the City. In determining the appropriate level of enforcement action the Director shall take additional factors into consideration. These factors shall include the magnitude of the violation, duration of the violation, effect of the violation on the receiving waters, or the POTW and/or its collection systems and worker health and safety, compliance history of the user, and good faith of the user in its compliance efforts. 
(c)  Upon notification of the violation, immediate action must be implemented by the user to abate discharge violations. Temporary measures must be instituted while permanent measures are designed and constructed. This may require discontinuance of the discharge to the sewer and temporary storage or alternate disposal of the wastestream until permanent measures are instituted. 
(d)  All instances of non-compliance must be permanently corrected within thirty (30) days unless an approved compliance schedule is in effect. 
(e)  In all instances of non-compliance, upon notification of the violation by the Director, it shall be the responsibility of the user to demonstrate compliance to the Director. 
(f)  Non-compliance with discharge requirements of the user's permit may be determined by an analysis of a grab or composite sample of the effluent of a user for any pollutant or condition specified in the user's permit or this chapter. 
(1)  Federal Categorical Standards. 
(i)  Composite sampling shall be used to determine non-compliance with Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except where a grab sample is required by Federal regulations. 
(ii)  Grab sampling may be used whenever collecting a composite sample is determined to be infeasible by the Director. 
(2)  Local Limits. 
(i)  Grab sampling may be utilized at any time to determine compliance with local limits or whenever an approved sampling station or well is not available for the City's use. Any local limit compliance or non-compliance may be determined through a grab sample. 
(g)  A subsequent sample will be taken within thirty (30) days after notification, which will also be subject to non-compliance fees if found to be non-compliant. If the second sample reveals non-compliance, the Director may proceed with one or more of the following: 
(1)  Require the user to attend a compliance meeting to consider alternatives and solutions; 
(2)  Issue a compliance schedule; 
(3)  Enter into a consent agreement; 
(4)  Issue a cease and desist order; 
(5)  Issue a compliance order; 
(6)  Order a show cause hearing; 
(7)  Suspension or revocation of the permit; and 
(8)  Commencement of any other enforcement action authorized by this chapter. 
(h)  The payment of non-compliance fees shall not bar the City from undertaking any enforcement actions authorized in this chapter nor waive the requirement for the user to comply with all federal, state, or local pretreatment standards. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.904 - Compliance schedule. 
The Director may issue a compliance schedule in the user's permit, or amend the permit by a compliance order to include a compliance schedule at any time, whenever it is determined that the user requires installation of new or modified pretreatment equipment. A compliance schedule may also be issued for developing waste management practices, slug discharge control plans, solvent management plans, or other related plans. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.905 - Consent agreement. 
The Director may enter into a consent agreement, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the non-compliance. Such documents must include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance within a time period also specified by the agreement. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 6-13.906 and 6-13.907 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.906 - Compliance orders. 
When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a permit, agreement, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, the Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.907 - Cease and desist orders. 
When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a permit, agreement, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(a)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(b)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.908 - Show cause hearing. 
The Director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a permit, agreement, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice must be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.909 - Emergency suspensions. 
(a)  Any user notified of a suspension order of its discharge must immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving waters, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 6-13.910 of this chapter are initiated against the user. 
(b)  The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension order is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial, endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(c)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment must submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination of discharge hearing under Sections 6-13.908 or 6-13.910 of this chapter. 
(d)  Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension order under this section. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.910 - Termination of discharge. 
In addition to the provisions in Section 6-13.613 of this chapter, any user who violates any of the following conditions is subject to termination of discharge:

(b)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater pollutants and characteristics of its discharge; 
(c)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, pollutants, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(d)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(e)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in this chapter. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 6-13.908 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.911 - Injunctive relief. 
When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a permit, agreement, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, the City may seek the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the permit, order, agreement, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The City may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.912 - Administrative liabilities. 
(a)  Whenever the Director finds that any person has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any permit condition or limitation of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the Director is empowered to assess administrative liabilities of not less than One Thousand and No/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars and not more than Ten Thousand Dollars and No/100ths ($10,000.00) Dollars per day for each day during which the violation continues. Such liabilities shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. 
(b)  After thirty (30) calendar days of nonpayment of fees or fines, a lien against the user or property owner's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such liabilities must file a written request for the Director to reconsider the liability along with full payment of the liability amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the liability. The Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the administrative liability. 
(§ 1, Ord. 1170, eff. April 21, 2011)  
6-13.913 - Civil penalties.

Article 10. - Newsracks 
 
7-1.1001 - Findings, purpose and intent. 
(a)  Findings. Based upon the evidence and testimony presented during the consideration of the ordinance codified in this article, and having weighed the costs and benefits of these regulations, the City Council finds and declares that: 
(1)  The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in the public right-of-way can constitute a threat to public health, safety, and welfare by interfering with and obstructing the use of the public right-of-way and by offending community aesthetic sensibilities. 
(2)  Newsracks located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rights-of-way, and unsightly, dirty or otherwise inadequately maintained newsracks located therein, constitute public nuisances. 
(3)  The uncontrolled proliferation of newsracks creates visual clutter and detracts from the appearance of streets, sidewalks, and adjacent businesses. 
(4)  The foregoing conditions are illustrated by the photos contained in Exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified in this article and constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious to health, offensive to the senses, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community. 
(5)  The Council recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The Council further finds that these strong and competing interests of providing for newsracks as a means to distribute information that is accessible to the public, and in a manner that is sensitive to the aesthetic attributes and pedestrian circulation require a reasonable accommodation, which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this article, which is designated to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place and manner of using such newsracks. 
(6)  The color, height and size restrictions and limitations on the number of newsracks at any one location or on a block, directly advance the City's substantial interests in curbing visual blight because newsracks that are smaller and shorter and more uniform in color are less apt to offend community aesthetic sensibilities. Also, fewer newsracks at any one location or on a block will advance the City's interest in eliminating visual clutter, as well as advancing pedestrian and vehicular safety. These restrictions are not based on content or viewpoint. A city may fairly prefer smaller or fewer objects of visual blight over larger ones, or more of them at any one location. By not banning all newsracks, a significant opportunity to communicate by other means is permitted which generally constitutes a First Amendment virtue rather than a vice. See Prime Media, Inc. v. City of Brentwood, Tennessee 398 F.3d 814 (6th Cir. 2005). 
(7)  In addition, as required by the tests used by the courts for time, place and manner restrictions such as contained in the ordinance codified in this article, these regulations leave ample alternative channels of communications in that although the number of newsracks in any one location or on any block are limited, there are a vast number of blocks and locations available in the City's thirty-eight and nine tenths square miles at which newsracks are permitted to be located under the Ordinance that are more than sufficient to accommodate the approximately two hundred fifty (250) to three hundred (300) newsracks currently in the City that are located in the public right-of-way. 
(8)  In creating these restrictions, the City Council has considered their costs and benefits and drafted these regulations so that they are not substantially broader than necessary to protect the City's interests in eliminating visual clutter, improving the communities aesthetics, and advancing public safety (see Get Outdoors II v. City of San Diego 506 F.3d 886 (9th Cir. 2007), and Prime Media Inc., Supra, cited with approval by the 9th Circuit in Get Outdoors II). 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to achieve the legally required reasonable fit between the City Council's goal of promoting the City's substantial governmental interests in aesthetics and safety and the regulation of the placement, appearance, number, size, and servicing of newsracks on the public rights-of-way so as to: 
(1)  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience, including the elimination of damage to persons and property from non-anchored newsracks caused by strong wind conditions, other acts of nature, or vandalism; 
(2)  Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any place of business or residence, from the street to the sidewalk, or from parked vehicles to the sidewalk; 
(3)  Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants, and mailboxes, and similar appurtenances, and access to locations used for public transportation purposes; 
(4)  Relocate and/or replace newsracks which result in a visual blight and clutter associated with poorly maintained, or improperly located, or abandoned newsracks, and unnecessarily large groupings of newsracks on the public rights-of-way; 
(5)  Protect the aesthetic character of the City and value of surrounding properties; 
(6)  Protect the quiet of residential areas; 
(7)  Encourage well-designed and aesthetically compatible newsracks; 
(8)  Reduce exposure of the City to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation, including the elimination of damage to persons and property from non-anchored newsracks caused by strong wind conditions, other acts of nature, or vandalism; 
(9)  Protect the right to distribute information, protected by the United States and California Constitutions, through the use of newsracks, leaving open ample alternative channels of communication; 
(10)  Recover the actual costs of processing and enforcing the original or amended encroachment permit. 
(c)  Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this article to in any way discriminate against, regulate, or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or dissemination of any printed material, which is constitutionally protected.

(2)  All newsracks shall be bolted to the sidewalk and must be mounted on a uniform size single pedestal (three (3?) to four (4?) inch by three (3?) to four (4?) inch square steel post), sixteen (16?) to seventeen (17?) inches tall, welded to a uniform base (ten (10?) inch by ten (10?) inch steel plate) and installed in accordance with the following standards: 
(i)  Only permanent newsracks placed and maintained in compliance with the provisions of this article shall be permitted upon the right-of-way. 
(ii)  Mounts shall be bolted in place in accordance with specifications on file in the Public Works Department of the City and only at locations and placements designated by the Department. 
(iii)  The breaking of existing sidewalk structures for the purpose of installing a newsrack shall be done in such a manner acceptable to the Director of Public Works as to do the least amount of damage to the remaining sidewalk structure and shall be done with approved equipment designed for that purpose. 
(iv)  The permittee is responsible for the installation of the newsrack. All work undertaken shall be the sole responsibility of the permit holder. Damage resulting from the installation of said newsrack shall be repaired immediately by and at the expense of the permittee. Failure to make the required repairs shall result in City forces undertaking to make such repairs. The cost of repairs shall be chargeable as a civil debt to the permit holder and may be collected by the City in the same manner as it collects any other civil debt or obligation. 
(b)  Location. In addition to the provisions of Section 7-1.1003, no newsrack shall be placed, installed, used, or maintained: 
(1)  Within five (5') feet of any marked crosswalk; 
(2)  Within fifteen (15') feet of the curb return of any unmarked crosswalk; 
(3)  Within fifteen (15') feet of any fire hydrant; 
(4)  Within five (5') feet of the far side of any driveway (when approaching a street-typical) and within fifteen (15') feet of the near side of the same driveway, since this placement would impede adequate sight distance of oncoming traffic (in regard to one-way streets: one-way streets would prohibit placement within five (5') feet to the far side of the driveway and fifteen (15') feet to the near side of the same driveway); 
(5)  Within five (5') feet ahead of and fifteen (15') feet to the rear of any sign or pavement markings designating a bus stop measured parallel to the flow of traffic; 
(6)  Within five (5') feet of any bus bench or transit shelter; 
(7)  At any location whereby the clear space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less than four (4') feet; 
(8)  On or within three (3') feet of any display window of any building abutting the sidewalk or parkway or in such a manner as to impede or interfere with the reasonable use of such window for display purposes; 
(9)  Within three (3') feet of light standards, trash receptacles, traffic signal control boxes, public safety control boxes, mailboxes, water meters, gas meters, electrical pull boxes, catch basins, and sewer manhole covers; 
(10)  Within five (5') feet of a curb painted blue pursuant to the provisions of California Vehicle Code Section 21458; 
(11)  Atop any vault, storm drain inlet, utility or traffic signal pull boxes; 
(12)  At any location where the news vending machine causes, creates, or constitutes a traffic hazard as determined by the Director of Public Works; 
(13)  Where the news vending machine will unreasonably interfere with or obstruct the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the street or highway; 
(14)  In any place or location not approved by the Director of Public Works based upon the standards contained in this article. 
(c)  Total number. No more than eight (8) newsracks shall be located on any public right-of-way within a space of two hundred (200') feet in any direction within the same block of the same street; and no more than sixteen (16) newsracks shall be allowed on any one block. As used herein "block" shall mean one side of a street between two (2) consecutive intersecting streets. Within a group of eight (8) newsracks, only one newsrack per publication shall be allowed. 
Newsracks that are adjacent to each other shall be evenly spaced. If more than four (4) newsracks are placed in a single location they shall be grouped in such a manner that the groups have an equal number, to the maximum extent possible, and each group shall be separated by a space that is a minimum of thirty-six (36?) inches. Placement of groups shall be subject to review and direction of the Director of Public Works. The intent of this requirement is to have a balanced and symmetrical appearance. For example, if seven (7) newsracks are placed at a single location, groupings of four (4) and three (3), with thirty-six (36?) inches between the groups would be acceptable. Groupings of six (6) and one would not be acceptable. Before placement, questions regarding groupings should be directed to the Public Works Department. 
(1)  In determining which newsracks shall be permitted to be placed at a specific location whenever more than eight (8) newsracks are proposed for any one permitted location or more than sixteen (16) newsracks are proposed for any one block, the Director of Public Works shall be guided solely by the following criteria: 
(i)  First priority shall be given to publications published five (5) or more days per week; 
(ii)  Second priority shall be given to publications published two (2) to four (4) days per week; 
(iii)  Third priority shall be given to publications published one day per week; 
(iv)  Fourth priority shall be given to publications published bimonthly; and 
(v)  Fifth priority shall be given to publications published monthly. 
(2)  In the event that there is a conflict between newspapers with the same priority seeking the same location, and there are insufficient newsrack spaces remaining to accommodate the conflicting newspapers after first filling as many spaces as possible by utilizing the criteria set forth above, then the Director of Public Works shall assign the space or spaces at random by lot, by drawing, one by one, the names of those applicants applying for the remaining space until the remaining spaces at that location have been filled. Such drawing shall be open to the public at a time and date designated by the Director of Public Works and shall occur once every year. 
(d)  Newsrack standards. 
(1)  Newsracks must be between twenty-six (26?) inches and twenty-eight (28?) inches in width, and between sixteen (16?) inches and twenty (20?) inches in depth. The height of each newsrack must be between thirty (30?) inches and thirty-two (32?) inches excluding the height of the pedestal. All newsracks shall be bolted to the sidewalk and must be mounted on a uniform size single pedestal (three (3?) to four (4?) inch by three (3?) to four (4?) inch steel post), sixteen (16?) to seventeen (17?) inches tall, welded to a uniform base (ten (10?) inch by ten (10?) inch steel plate) and installed in accordance with the following standards: 
(2)  Each newsrack shall be constructed of metal. Newsracks constructed of plastic are prohibited. 
(3)  The colors of newsracks shall be limited to neutral hues (matte not glossy) of blue, olive green, white, or dark brown. 
(4)  Each newsrack shall have a display case with a sturdy, clear plastic window. 
(5)  Newsracks shall not have external electrical service and shall not be equipped with any devices to emit light or sound. 
(e)  Maintenance. Each newsrack shall be maintained in a clean, neat and attractive condition and in good repair at all times. 
(f)  Advertising. No newsrack shall be used for commercial advertising, signs or publicity purposes, other than identifying the newspaper material contained therein. A publication's name or logo may be permitted on the sides and back of any newsrack, but not on top or the pedestal of any newsrack.

A written notification shall also be provided to the newsrack owner. A timely request for a hearing shall stay any removal of the newsrack. If, however, the violation is not corrected within five (5) days after the decision at such requested hearing becomes final, the newsrack may be summarily removed. 
(b)  Alternatives to tagging. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of violations of this article relative to location of newsracks, restrictions upon attachments of newsracks to property other than that owned by the owner of the newsrack, to fixed objects, or to each other, the Director of Public Works may, as an alternative to tagging said newsrack, move, align, remove such attachment, or otherwise move such rack or racks in order to restore them to a legal condition. 
(c)  Removal. Any newsrack which has been tagged and remains in violation of the provisions stated on the tag past the fifteen (15) day correction period, and where no hearing has been requested, shall be removed by the Director of Public Works and stored in any convenient place. 
(d)  Notification of removal. The Director of Public Works shall notify the owner or his designate of the removal by mailing a "Notice of Removal" to the last known address of the owner/designate. Such notice shall be mailed within five (5) days after the end of the fifteen (15) day correction period and shall state: (1) the date the newsrack was removed; (2) the reasons for the removal; (3) the locations of and procedure for claiming the newsrack; and, (4) the procedure for obtaining a post-removal hearing before the Director of Public Works if desired. 
(e)  Release. Any newsrack removed and stored pursuant to these provisions shall be released to the owner thereof within forty-five (45) calendar days after the mailing of the written notice of removal upon providing satisfactory proof of ownership and payment of an impound fee in an amount equal to the reasonable cost to the City of removing and storing the newsrack. If, after a hearing, the impounded newsrack is determined not to have been in violation of this article, the newsrack shall be returned to the owner without payment of any removal and/or storage fee. If such newsrack remains unclaimed after this forty-five (45) calendar day period, it shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and may be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 2 of this Code. 
(f)  Removal in exigent circumstances. In the case of any newsrack which in violation of the provisions of this article creates an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of the public, which cannot be corrected by moving or otherwise repositioning the newsrack, said newsrack may be summarily removed and stored in a convenient location so as to eliminate the danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public. The Director of Public Works shall notify the owner of the removal by mailing a "Notice of Removal" to the last known address of the owner. Such notice shall be mailed within five (5) days after the removal of the newsrack and shall contain the same information as set forth in subsection (d) of this section. Release of any such newsrack shall be accomplished in the same manner as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

7-3.08 - Parkway trees and shrubs: Planting. 
(a)  Advance notice. The Department shall be notified forty-eight (48) hours prior to the installation of parkway trees and shrubs for the approval of the species, material quality, and planting supervision. 
(b)  Soil analysis. The developer or property owner may be required to have a composite soil analysis made by a soil testing laboratory at the expense of the developer or property owner in order to insure the success of the planting where the alteration of the soil composition is anticipated by virtue of the development. The location and number of samples shall be determined by the City. The criteria to be used in determining the necessity for soil analysis and the location and number of samples shall be: 
(1)  Whether substantial amounts of topsoil are to be removed; 
(2)  Whether grading will bring ground waters so close to the surface that soil salts will interfere with good growth; and 
(3)  Whether cuts and fills will so alter the available soils as to require soil amendment. 
The analysis shall include the fertility level, the organic content, and the infiltration rate and permeability in place. A copy of the test results shall be forwarded directly to the Department. 
(c)  Condition of trees and shrubs. Trees and shrubs to be planted shall satisfy current industry standards and shall: 
(1)  Be symmetrical; 
(2)  Be typical for variety and species; 
(3)  Be healthy, vigorous, and free from disease and insect pests; 
(4)  Have healthy, vigorous root systems free from serious kinking, circling, damages, or other defects; and 
(5)  Be of a type otherwise permitted by law. 
(d)  Containers: Balling. Unless bare root trees or trees in other types or sizes of containers are specified by the City, all trees shall be grown or established in containers of not less than fifteen (15) gallons capacity or be balled in burlap in accordance with industry standards. 
(e)  Redwood shavings. Redwood shavings shall be redwood shavings combined with one pound of actual nitrogen for each cubic yard of shavings. 
(f)  Planting tablets. For tree plantings, planting tablets shall be a commercial fertilizer in tablet form meeting industry standards. The tablet shall be compressed and yield a slow release of nutrient over a twelve (12) month period. 
(g)  Standard plans for tree planting and landscaping: Distribution. The Director from time to time shall update the standard plans for tree planting and landscaping, based on current industry standards, for distribution to developers and other applicants to aid in fulfilling the requirements of this chapter. Such plans shall be printed diagrams and instructions which illustrate the criteria, procedures, and other requirements of this chapter for the installation of landscaping. 
(h)  Prepared soil mix. When soil analysis is not a requirement, the prepared soil mix for the backfill for the pits for trees shall consist of the following: 
(1)  One-third Redwood shavings fortified with nitrogen; 
(2)  Two-thirds natural soil with organic fertilizer; and 
(3)  Appropriate planting tablets based upon tree size and industry standards. 
In planting locations where soil analyses were required, the prepared soil mix shall be based on test results. Amendments to be combined with native soil shall be determined by the City on the basis of what the tests reveal will be required and shall be a requirement for parkway trees. 
(i)  Planting holes. For trees, all planting holes shall be dug square with bottoms level, the width not less than two (2) times the diameter of the ball and the depth two (2) times the depth of the ball. The planting holes shall be inspected by the City prior to the planting of the trees. The Director may require four vertical mulch holes (3? wide by 3' deep) to accommodate poor drainage, and the installation of root control devices at the expense of the developer or property owner planting trees or having trees planted. Such devices shall be approved as to design and materials by the Director. 
The holes shall be backfilled with the thoroughly mixed prepared soil to the bottom of the tree ball. The planting tablets shall be evenly spaced around the perimeter of the hole on the top of the prepared soil. 
(j)  Tree placement. Each tree shall be placed in the center of the hole, in vertical position, so that the crown of the root ball will stand one inch (1") above the finish grade. 
(k)  Backfilling. After setting a tree, the rest of the hole shall be backfilled with the prepared soil mix and watered thoroughly. The soil shall be firmed down, eliminating air pockets. The soil shall not be packed. 
(1)  Basins. For tree plantings, a six (6?) inch high berm shall be built around the edge of the excavated hole to form a basin for holding at least twenty (20) gallons of water. The bottom of the basin shall be at the surrounding finish grade. The basin shall be filled with water, with care taken not to break down the berm with the hose stream nor to gouge out holes in the backfill. 
(m)  Staking. Each fifteen (15) gallon sized tree shall be supported with two (2), two (2?) inch by eight foot (8') round lodge pole pine, green colored, pentachloral phenol preservative treated stakes. Trees larger than fifteen (15) gallon sized shall be supported by four (4), three (3?) inch by twelve foot (12') lodge poles. 
(n)  Tying. Each tree shall be secured to the stake with cinch ties, or corded tire ties, in accordance with industry standards. 
(o)  Maintenance. Prior to acceptance by the City, the permittee shall maintain the trees and shrubs by watering, restaking, and retying as necessary. 
(p)  Acceptance. Acceptance of planted street trees and shrubs in residential developments shall be in accordance with the subdivision provisions (see Chapter 2 of Title 9 of this Code). Street trees and shrubs planted at commercial and industrial developments will be accepted by the Council with the street improvements if the planting is completed.

(b)  These potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.103 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
(a)  To protect human life and health; 
(b)  To minimize expenditure of public monies for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(f)  To help maintain a stable tax base by requiring that due regard be given to flood risk factors in floodplain development in order to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(g)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(h)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.104 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(a)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(d)  Controlling fill, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(e)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plan and specification shall not prevent the Floodplain Administrator from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and specifications or from suspending construction operations when such plans, specification or construction are in violation of this chapter or any codes hereby adopted by reference, or other applicable state or federal law. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.309 - No representation regarding other laws. 
There are many ordinances and other laws applicable to activities permitted under this chapter which are not considered in this permitting process. Such laws include, by way of example but not limited to, building, land grading and erosion control, and land development measures. The issuance of a flood area development permit shall not be deemed to constitute a representation that the development so permitted or the property upon which such development is occurring complies with any other ordinances or other laws. Nor shall the existence of such an unrevoked permit be deemed to preclude any criminal or civil remedy for violation of such other ordinances or laws. The possession of a flood area development permit shall not be deemed to relieve the holder of the requirement to apply for or obtain any other license or permit required by any other ordinance, statute, regulation or law.

Article 4. - Floodplain Administrator 
 
7-5.401 - Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The Director of Public Works is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.402 - Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(a)  Permit review. Review all development permits to determine: 
(1)  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
(2)  The site is reasonably safe from flooding and that the flood area development permit requirements of this chapter have been fully satisfied; 
(3)  All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained; 
(4)  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations (BFEs) have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and future conditions of development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by one-tenth of one foot or more at any point within the City of Simi Valley; and 
(5)  All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
(6)  Inspect all development projects to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter, including proper elevation of structures. 
(i)  The first inspection shall be conducted when the site is staked out or otherwise marked. 
(ii)  The second inspection shall be conducted when the lowest floor is built and completed. 
(iii)  The third inspection shall be conducted when the development is finished. 
(iv)  Elevation certificates shall be required prior to all inspections. 
(b)  Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures. 
(1)  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
(2)  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
(c)  Review, use and development of other base flood data. 
(1)  When BFE data has not been provided in accordance with Section 7-5.302, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer Article 6, or; 
(2)  A BFE shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
(d)  Notification of other agencies. Notification of other agencies shall be made as follows: 
(1)  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
(i)  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
(ii)  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
(iii)  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
(2)  BFE changes due to physical alterations: 
(i)  Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(ii)  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
(3)  Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
(e)  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
(1)  Certification required by Section 7-5.603(d)(2) and Section 7-5.605(a)(3) (lowest floor elevations); 
(2)  Certification required by Section 7-5.603(d)(3) (elevation or floodproofing of non-residential structures); 
(3)  Certification required by Sections 7-5.603(d)(5) (flood openings); 
(4)  Certification of elevation required by Section 7-5.605(a)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
(5)  Certification required by Section 7-5.609(a) (floodway encroachments); and 
(6)  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(f)  Map determination. Make interpretations where needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 7-5.803(b). 
(g)  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 7-5.303. 
(h)  Agreements. Execute and record non-conversion and hold harmless agreements. 
(i)  Biennial report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA to provide information on the community floodplain management program and changes in its flood hazard areas, which assists FEMA to evaluate the effectiveness of a community's floodplain management activities. 
(j)  Planning. Assure that the General Plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(k)  Non-conversion of enclosed areas below the lowest floor. To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the this chapter in effect at the time of conversion, the Floodplain Administrator shall: 
(1)  Determine which applicants for new construction and/or substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are five (5) feet or higher. 
(2)  Enter into a "Non-Conversion Agreement For Construction Within Flood Hazard Areas" or equivalent with the City of Simi Valley. The agreement shall be recorded with the Ventura County Recorder as a deed restriction. The non-conversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Floodplain Administrator and City Attorney and have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below the BFE to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least seventy-two (72) hours.

(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.609 - Floodways. 
Located within SFHAs, established in Section 7-5.302, are areas designated as floodways. The regulatory floodway shown in the Flood Insurance Study has been selected and adopted on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. In accordance with this principle, and the fact that the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(a)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(b)  If Section 7-5.608(a) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 6. 
(c)  All new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within floodways which will cause increases in the BFE shall only be permitted if the permittee has applied to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for modification of the flood insurance rate maps and has received conditional approval of such modifications, and all other applicable provisions of this chapter are satisfied. 
(d)  If no floodway is identified, the applicant for a flood area development permit shall provide an engineering study to demonstrate that any new development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one-tenth of one foot. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.610 - Floodways not delineated. 
If no floodway is identified, the applicant for a flood area development permit shall provide an engineering study to demonstrate that any new development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by one-tenth of one foot or more. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
Article 7. - Loading 
 
7-5.701 - General. 
All structures covered by this chapter shall be capable of resisting all loads required by the building code and the loads prescribed in this chapter without exceeding allowable stresses. "Water loads" are loads or pressures on surfaces of structures caused and induced by the presence of flood waters. They are hydrostatic, hydrodynamic or impact loads. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.702 - Hydrostatic loads. 
(a)  Hydrostatic loads are those caused by water above or below surface, free or confined, which is either stagnant or moves at low velocities less than five (5) feet per second. 
The pressure at any point is equal to the unit weight of water (62.4 pounds per cubic foot) multiplied by the height of water above the point to which confined water would rise if free to do so. 
Hydrostatic loads consist of vertical loads, lateral loads, and uplift. 
(1)  Vertical loads. These are loads acting vertically downward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of buildings or structures, such as roofs, decks or floors, and walls, caused by the weight of flood waters above them. 
(2)  Lateral loads. Lateral hydrostatic loads are those which act in a horizontal direction, against vertical or inclined surfaces, both above and below the ground surface and tend to cause lateral displacement overturning of the building, structure, or parts thereof. 
(3)  Uplift. Uplift loads are those which act in a vertically upward direction on the underside of horizontal or sloping surfaces of buildings or structures, such as basement slabs, footings, floors, decks, roofs and overhangs. Hydrostatic loads acting on inclined, rounded or irregular surfaces may be resolved into vertical or uplift loads and lateral loads based on the geometry of the surfaces and the distribution of hydrostatic pressures. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.703 - Hydrodynamic loads. 
Hydrodynamic loads, the purpose of these regulations, are those induced on structures the flow of flood water moving at moderate to high velocity around the structures or parts thereof, above ground level. Such loads may occur below the ground level when openings or conduits exist which allow free flow of flood waters. Hydrodynamic loads are basically of the lateral type and relate to direct impact loads by the moving mass of water, and to drag forces as the water flows around the obstruction. 
Conversion to equivalent hydrostatic loads. For the purpose of these regulations, and for cases when water velocities do not exceed ten (10) feet per second, dynamic effects of the moving water may be converted into equivalent hydrostatic loads by increasing the depth of water by an amount dh, on the upstream side and above the ground level only, equal to: 
 
"V" is the average velocity of the water in feet per second; 
"g" is the acceleration of gravity, 32.2 feet per second per second; and 
"a" is the coefficient of drag or shape factor. (The value of "a", unless otherwise evaluated, shall not be less than 1.25). 
The equivalent surcharge depth "dh" shall be added to the depth measured between the design level and the regulatory flood and the resultant pressures applied to, and uniformly distributed across, the vertical projected area of the building or structure which is perpendicular to the flow. Surfaces parallel to the flow or surfaces facing downstream shall be considered subject to hydrostatic pressures for depths to the regulatory flood only. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.704 - Impact loads. 
(a)  Types. For the purposes of these regulations, impact loads are those which result from floating debris and floatable objects or masses carried by flood waters striking against structures or parts thereof. These loads are of two (2) basic types: normal and special. 
(1)  Normal impact loads. Normal impact loads are those which relate to isolated occurrences of logs or floatable objects of normally encountered sizes striking buildings or parts thereof. 
(2)  Special impact loads. Special impact loads are those which relate to large conglomerates of floatable objects, such as an accumulation of floating debris, either striking or resting against a building or parts thereof. 
(b)  Applicability. Impact loads shall be considered in the design of structures and parts thereof as stipulated below: 
(1)  Normal impact loads. A concentrated load acting horizontally at the regulatory flood level or at any point below it, equal to the impact force, produced by a 1,000 pound mass traveling at the velocity of the flood water and acting on a one square foot surface of the structure. 
(i)  Deceleration of the mass shall occur over 0.5 seconds; 
(ii)  This load shall be applied to the structure in such a manner that stresses are maximized. 
(2)  Special impact loads. Special impact loads shall be considered in the design of buildings, structures, or parts thereof. Unless a rational and detailed analysis is made and submitted for approval by the Director of Public Works, the intensity of load shall be taken as 100 pounds per foot acting horizontally over a one foot wide horizontal strip at the regulatory flood level or at any level below it. Where natural or artificial barriers exist which would effectively prevent these special impact loads from occurring, the loads may be ignored in the design. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.705 - Pressure equalization. 
All new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclose areas below the lowest floor and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. See Section 7-5.603(e)(5). 
Pressure equalization shall be appropriate for unfinished or flood-resistant enclosures either unused or solely used for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in areas other than basements. All other structures shall be elevated or floodproofed pursuant to the terms of this chapter. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
Article 8. - Variance Procedures 
 
7-5.801 - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "Historic Structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(b)  Variances shall not be issued within any regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Floodplain Administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Floodplain Administrator believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon all of the following: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause, which does not include economic considerations, aesthetics, or past practices; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create "nuisances", cause a fraud upon the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 7-5.802 and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission, acting as the Variance Board, may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.802 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the City to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are intended to be quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.803 - Variance board. 
(a)  The Planning Commission of the City ("Commission"), acting as the Variance Board, shall hear and decide appeals of a decision of the Floodplain Administrator and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. The Commission, and Council on appeal of a decision of the Commission, shall hear the variance application at a noticed public hearing with notice made as required for variances pursuant to Title 9, Planning and Zoning, of this Code. 
(b)  The Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Commission, pursuant to this chapter, may appeal such decision to the City Council. Such appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar days of the Commission's decision and shall specify the project and grounds for appeal. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(e)  In hearing such applications, the Commission shall consider all of the following: 
(1)  The standards specified in this chapter; 
(2)  Engineering and technical reports prepared for the project; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed structure and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing and future owners of the property; 
(6)  The importance of the community of the services provided by the proposed facility; 
(7)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the General Plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(10)  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
(12)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(f)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the City that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Ventura County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(g)  The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.804 - Notice of appeal. 
(a)  A request for appeal may be taken only by filing a written notice of appeal with the Secretary of the Board no later than the tenth (10th) day after the date the Floodplain Administrator makes a written determination accepting, denying, or modifying a proposed application to this chapter. 
(b)  Each notice of appeal shall include: 
(1)  A description of the work or improvements proposed to be made or done; 
(2)  A description of the proposed location of the work or improvements; 
(3)  The reasons, in detail, why: 
(i)  The decision of the Floodplain Administrator should not be sustained; and 
(ii)  The relief requested for should be granted. 
(c)  An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of this chapter or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of this chapter do not fully apply, or an equally good or better form of construction is proposed. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.805 - Decisions. 
(a)  Should the Board render a decision contrary to that of the Floodplain Administrator, then the decision of Board shall be deemed the decision of the Floodplain Administrator. 
(b)  The decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
Article 9. - Map Amendments 
 
7-5.901 - Alteration of a special flood hazard area. 
When a special flood hazard area, as established in accordance with Section 7-5.302, is altered due to development or a flood control project, the party responsible for the alteration shall submit a request, on forms submitted by the Floodplain Administrator, to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, that a map revision be made. 
(§ 1 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1268, eff. April 20, 2017)  
7-5.902 - Map amendments. 
(a)  The procedures for map corrections, letters of map amendment, conditional letters of map revision and letters of map revision shall be those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations shall be kept on file in the Department of Public Works. The City is preempted from enacting any procedures in this area. 
(b)  The City shall require a fee in an amount to be determined by resolution of the City Council for processing any map amendment requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(c)  All map revisions and watershed studies shall include analyses based on future build-out conditions hydrology associated with anticipated watershed growth and land-use and land-cover changes. These future condition analyses shall be included on community floodplain maps and will serve as the basis for this regulation.

FINDINGS: 
Local Geological, Topographic Conditions - The City of Simi Valley, the greater Ventura County area, and the southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The City contains areas designated as flood zones, liquefaction, and landslide hazards. These amendments are required to address and clarify special needs to reduce hazards resulting from liquefaction or soil displacement due to strong seismic events. This modification to improve design and construction methods for foundations of structures shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
2305.4 Hold-down connectors. Hold-down connectors shall be designed to resist shear wall overturning moments using approved cyclic load values or 75 percent of the allowable earthquake load values that do not consider cyclic loading of the product. Minimum connector bolt diameter shall be ½ inch. Connector bolts into wood framing require steel plate washers on the post on the opposite side of the anchorage device. Plate size shall be a minimum of 0.229 inch by 3 inches by 3 inches (5.82 mm by 76 mm by 76 mm) in size. Hold-downs shall be re-tightened just prior to covering the wall framing. 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The modification to establish certain performance requirements for hold-down connectors, which is essential to preventing failure of a shear wall due to excessive deflection, shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
2305.5 Quality of Nails. Mechanically driven nails used in wood structural panel shear walls shall meet the same dimensions as that required for hand-driven nails, including diameter, minimum length and minimum head diameter. No clipped head or box nails permitted in new construction. The allowable design value for clipped head nails in existing construction may be taken at no more than the nail-head-area ratio of that of the same size hand-driven nails. 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The modification to require mechanically driven nails to have the same dimension as hand driven nail resulting in improve quality of construction and performance of shear wall panels shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
SECTION 2306 ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN. 
This section is hereby amended to read as follows: 
2306.4 Lumber sheathed shear walls. Single and double diagonally sheathed lumber shear walls shall be designed in accordance with AF&PA SDPWS. Single and double diagonally sheathed lumber walls shall not be used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F. 
2306.4.1. Wood-framed shear walls. Wood-framed shear walls shall be designed and constructed in accordance with AF&PA SDPWS. Wood structural panel thickness for shear walls shall not be less than nominal 15/32 inch thick and studs shall not be spaced at more than 16 inches on center. 
The maximum allowable shear value for three-ply plywood resisting seismic forces is 200 pounds per foot (2.92 kn/m). Nails shall be placed not less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) in from the panel edges and not less than 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) from the edge of the connecting members for shear greater than 350 pounds per foot (5.11 kn/m). Nails shall be placed not less than 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) from panel edges and not less than 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) from the edge of the connecting members for shears of 350 pounds per foot (5.11 kn/m) or less. 
Any wood structural panel sheathing used for diaphragms and shear walls that are part of the seismic-force-resisting system shall be applied directly to framing members. 
Exception: Wood structural panel sheathing in a horizontal diaphragm is permitted to be fastened over solid lumber planking or laminated decking, provided the panel joints and lumber planking or laminated decking joints do not coincide. 
The wood-framed shear walls using staples as fasteners shall not be permitted. 
Exception: Staples designated in Table 2306.3(1) of this Code may be used for wood structural panel shear wall to resist seismic loading, when the allowable shear values of Table 2306.3(1) of this Code, or greater, are substantiated by cyclic testing and approved by the Building Official. 
2306.7 Shear walls sheathed with other materials. Shear walls sheathed with portland cement plaster, gypsum lath, gypsum sheathing, or gypsum board shall not be used to resist seismic forces in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F. 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions - The City of Simi Valley, the greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Gypsum wallboard and exterior Portland cement plaster have performed poorly during recent California seismic events. (Such as Loma Prieta and Northridge.) The shear values for gypsum wallboard and Portland cement stucco and staple fasteners contained in the Code are based on mono-directional testing only. The limitation on the use of these systems as set forth in the amendment until cyclic loading testing are performed and evaluated in a more rigorous standard which will better prevent damage to a structure's lateral load resisting system which can result from local conditions. This modification is incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
Section 2308 Conventional light-framed construction. 
This section is here by amended to read as follows: 
2308.3.4 Braced wall line support. Braced wall lines shall be supported by continuous foundations.

d. S-W sheathing shall be 15/32? thick nailed with 8d nails, at 6:6:12. 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Conventional framing does not address the need for a continuous load path, critical shear transfer mechanisms, connection ties, irregular and flexible portions of complex shaped structures. Unless designed by a registered design professional, such buildings built by conventional framing requirements will be prone to serious damage in future large earthquakes. This modification shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary.

DIVISION 4.4 MATERIAL CONSERVATION AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY. 
SECTION 4.408 CONSTRUCTION WASTE REDUCTION, DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING. 
This section is hereby amended to read as follows: 
4.408.1 Construction waste reduction of at least 75 percent. Recycle and/or salvage for reuse a minimum of 75 percent of the nonhazardous construction and demolition debris. 
Exceptions: 
1. Excavated soil and land-clearing debris 
2. Alternate waste reduction methods developed by working with local agencies if diversion or recycle facilities capable of compliance with this item do not exist or are not located reasonably close to the jobsite. 
FINDINGS: 
Topographic  The City of Simi Valley has varied topography that requires special grading precautions. As a result, the disposal area of the landfill that serves the City is limited in size and the allowed amount of solid waste that may be deposited. This conservation measure is incorporated into code to reduce the amount of solid waste that is deposited in the landfill thereby reducing the amount of grading required for disposal of solid waste, and the demand on limited topographic resources. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that this amendment is reasonably necessary.

R301.1.3.2 Woodframe structures. The Building Official shall require construction documents to be designed, approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for all dwellings of woodframe construction more than one story in height or with a basement located in Seismic Design Category D 0 , D 1 , D 2, or E 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Conventional framing does not address the need for a continuous load path, critical shear transfer mechanisms, connection ties, irregular and flexible portions of complex shaped structures. Unless designed by a registered design professional, such buildings built by conventional framing requirements will be prone to serious damage in future large earthquakes. This modification shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
SECTION R401 GENERAL. 
This section is hereby amended to read as follows: 
R401.1 Application. The provisions of this Chapter shall control the design and construction of the foundation and foundations spaces for all buildings. In addition to the provisions of this Chapter, the design and construction of foundations in areas prone to flooding as established by Table R301.2(1) shall meet the provisions of section R322.

SECTION R403 FOOTINGS. 
This section is hereby amended to read as follows: 
R403.1.1 Minimum Size. Prescriptive reinforced concrete footings for one or two story woodframed residential buildings shall be dimensioned in accordance with Chapter 11 Section 1809.7 of this Code. 
Minimum size of hold-down anchor bolt for braced wall panels shall be one-half (1/2) inch diameter. 
R403.1.2 Continuous footing in Seismic Design Categories D 0 , D 1 , D 2 or E. The braced wall panels at exterior walls of buildings located in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1, D2 or E shall be supported by continuous footings. All required interior braced wall panels in buildings shall be supported by continuous footings. 
R403.1.3 Seismic Reinforcing. Concrete footings located in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1, D2 or E shall have minimum reinforcement. Bottom reinforcement shall be located a minimum of 3 inches (76 mm) clear from the bottom of the footing. 
In Seismic Design Categories D0, D1, D2 or E where a construction joint is created between a concrete footing and a stem wall, a minimum of one (1) No. 4 bar shall be installed at not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center. The vertical bar shall extend to 3 inches (76 mm) clear of the bottom of the footing, have a standard hook and extend a minimum of 14 inches (357 mm) into the stem wall. 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological, Topographic Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, the greater Ventura County area, and the southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The City contains areas designated as flood zones, liquefaction, and landslide hazards. These amendments are required to address and clarify special needs to reduce hazards resulting from liquefaction or soil displacement due to strong seismic events. This modification to improve design and construction methods for foundations of residential structures shall be incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary. 
SECTION R601 GENERAL. 
This section is hereby amended to read as follows: 
R601.1 Application. The provisions of this Chapter shall control the design and construction of all walls and partitions for all buildings. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, gypsum lath, gypsum sheathing, gypsum board, Portland cement plaster, fiberboard, or particle board shall not be used as a structural material or structural component to resist seismic forces in shear walls, braced wall panels, vertical diaphragms or other similar seismic resisting elements. When materials are substantiated by cyclic testing, demonstrating the necessary strength and ductility, and are approved by the Building Official, such materials may be used to resist seismic forces. 
The wood structural panel shear walls using staples as fasteners shall not be permitted unless the structural panel assembly is substantiated by cyclic testing, and approved by the Building Official. 
Wall bracing method for seismic design categories D 2 and E shall be CS-WSP, with a minimum thickness of one-half (1/2) inch. 
Minimum length of any individual braced wall panel shall not be less than thirty-six (36) inches for seismic design categories D 2 or E. 
Minimum total length of braced wall panels along each braced wall line shall be in accordance with Table R602.10.3(3) for seismic design category D 2 . 
FINDINGS: 
Local Geological Conditions  The City of Simi Valley, the greater Ventura County area, and southern California region is a densely populated area having buildings constructed over and near a vast array of fault systems capable of producing major earthquakes, including but not limited to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Gypsum wallboard, exterior Portland cement plaster, and similar wall construction techniques and materials lacking adequate ductility, and deformation characteristics, have performed poorly during California seismic events. (Such as Loma Prieta and Northridge.) The shear values for gypsum wallboard, Portland cement stucco, fiberboard and staple fasteners contained in the Code are based on mono-directional testing only. The limitation on the use of these systems as set forth in the amendment until cyclic loading testing are performed and evaluated in a more rigorous standard which will better prevent damage to a structure's lateral load resisting system which can result from local conditions. This modification is incorporated into the Code to assure that new buildings and additions to existing buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the scope and objectives of the California Building Code. For this reason, this jurisdiction determines that these amendments are reasonably necessary.

The Council hereby adopts the City of Simi Valley Zoning Map (hereafter referred to as the "Zoning Map"), which is on file with the Department. The Zoning Map is hereby incorporated into this Zoning Ordinance by reference as though it were fully included here. The boundaries of the zoning districts established by Section 9-20.020 shall be shown upon the Zoning Map. 
A.  Map amendments. Amendments to the Zoning Map shall follow the process established in Chapter 9-73 (Amendments). 
B.  Zoning Map boundaries. The following rules shall apply in determining the boundaries or classification of any zoning district shown on the Zoning Map. 
1.  Where zoning district boundaries approximately follow street or alley lines, the centerline of the streets or alleys shall be construed as the boundaries; otherwise the boundaries shall be determined by using the scale appearing on the Zoning Map unless specifically indicated by dimensions. 
2.  If a zoning district boundary divides or splits a parcel, the entire parcel shall be deemed to be included within the zoning district that is the most restrictive, unless the parcel is subdivided to allow for development under the appropriate zoning district for each parcel. 
3.  Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly in the street or alley will be included within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned street or alley. 
4.  A symbol indicating the classification of property on the Zoning Map shall apply in each instance to the whole of the area within the district boundaries. 
Where uncertainty of zoning district boundaries still exists, the Commission, by written resolution, shall recommend the location of any zone boundary or setback line to the Council for its action and final decision.

Chapter 9-24 - Residential and Open Space Zoning Districts 
 
9-24.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
This Chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the residential and open space zoning districts established by Section 9-20.020 (Zoning Districts Established). It also determines the type of Land Use Permit approval required for each use and provides the general standards for site development. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-24.020 - Purposes of Residential and Open Space Zoning Districts 
Different residential zoning districts are intended to provide a range of housing types that are affordable and attractive, in well-designed residential neighborhoods. Open space zoning districts maintain community open space resources for purposes ranging from conservation, to preserving community land use options. Requirements for the land uses allowed in the residential and open space zoning districts, and standards for development project site planning, design, residential density, and minimum parcel size are found in Sections 9-24.030 and 9-24.040, respectively. The purposes of the individual residential and open space zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: 
A.  OS (Open Space) District. The OS zoning district is intended to provide for the conservation of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, to preserve and enhance environmental quality, and to provide for the retention of the maximum number of future land use options while allowing reasonable and compatible uses on open lands in the City that have not been altered to any major extent by human activities. The maximum density for residential uses is one primary dwelling unit for each 40 acres. (1)(2) 
B.  RE (Residential Estate) District. The RE zoning district is intended to provide for a custom-designed residential environment with very large lots, houses of an individual style, and a distinct single-family neighborhood image. The minimum lot area in this zoning district is one acre and the maximum residential density is one dwelling per lot. (1)(2) 
C.  RVL (Residential Very Low Density) District. The RVL zoning district is intended to provide for a semi-rural single-family residential environment with relatively large lots. The minimum lot area in this zoning district is 20,000 square feet, and the maximum residential density is one dwelling per lot. (1)(2) 
D.  RL (Residential Low Density) District. The RL zoning district is intended to provide for a suburban single-family residential environment with a range of parcel sizes, but with generally low density and some clustering of parcels. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 2.1 to 3.5 dwelling units per acre. The maximum density is one dwelling per lot. (1)(2) 
E.  RM (Residential Medium Density) District. The RM zoning district is intended to provide for a suburban single-family residential environment with a range of parcel sizes and some clustering of parcels. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 3.6 to 5.0 units per acre. The maximum density is one dwelling per lot. (1)(2) 
F.  RMod (Residential Moderate Density) District. The RMod zoning district is intended to provide for moderate density detached single-family or multi-family dwellings. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 5.1 to 10.0 units per acre. (1)(2)(3) 
G.  RH (Residential High Density) District. The RH zoning district is intended for areas of more compact multi-family residential developments, such as townhouses, garden apartments, and other multiple-unit dwellings. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 10.1 to 20 units per acre. (2) 
H.  RVH (Residential Very High Density) District. The RVH zoning district is intended to provide for areas of relatively high density, with compact multi-family residential development near district of community shopping centers. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 20.1 to 35.0 units per acre. (2) 
I.  MH (Mobile Home) District. The MH zoning district is intended to accommodate mobile home parks, to expand the range of housing opportunities available in the community. The residential density in this zoning district may range from 0 to 8 units per acre. (2) 
J.  W (Water Storage Facilities) District. The W zoning district establishes areas within the City reserved for the location of water storage facilities and wireless telecommunications facilities on property owned by government agencies. This zone is consistent with all underlying General Plan land use designations. 
K.  WP (Water Storage Facilities) District. The WP zoning district establishes areas in the City reserved for the location of water storage tanks, on privately owned property, and properly situated for the placement and safe aesthetic operation of wireless telecommunications facilities on property containing water storage facilities with ownerships other than government agencies or utilities regulated by the Public Utilities Commission while minimizing impacts on the immediately natural environment. This zone is consistent with all underlying General Plan land use designations. 
Notes: 
(1) Except as provided by Sections 9-44.150, 9-44.160 relating to Second Dwelling units. 
(2) Minimum density for each residential zone may be less than the densities indicated above due to maximum residential dwelling unit calculations for units subject to the Hillside Performance Standards, Section 9-32.070. 
(3) Depending on the type of development, either the single-family residential standards or the multi-family residential standards will apply to the project. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006, as amended by Exh. A, Ord. 1147, eff. August 20, 2009 and § 3 (Exh. B), Ord. No. 1193, eff. July 19, 2012)  
9-24.030 - Residential and Open Space District Land Uses and Permit Requirements 
A.  Table 2-2 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Development Code in the residential and open space zoning districts, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Chapter 9-22 (Land Use Permit Requirements). Regardless of the permit requirement established by Table 2-2, Planned Development Permit (Section 9-52.050) approval is also required for all construction of new residential units. 
Note: Where the last column in the tables ("Specific Use Regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use; however, provisions in other sections of this Development Code may also apply. 
B.  Specific Plan (SP) Land Use Designations and Zoning Districts: Allowable land uses within Specific Plans shall be determined by the applicable specific plan, except that commercial nonmedicinal and medicinal cannabis uses, operations, and activities, including cultivation, dispensaries, distribution, deliveries, manufacturing, processing, microbusinesses, storing, laboratory testing, packaging, labeling, and transportation facilities are prohibited uses in the City (refer to Chapter 5-41 for Nonmedicinal and Medicinal Cannabis Standards).

9-24.050 - Residential and Open Space District Setback Exceptions 
The following exceptions apply to the setback requirements shown in Table 2-3. See also Section 9-30.080 (Setback Requirements and Exceptions). For Accessory Dwelling Units and Junior Accessory Dwelling Units, refer to Section 9-44.160. 
A.  Front yard setback requirements. In the RVL, RL, RM, and RMod zones, subject to the approval of a Planned Development Permit for five or more units, up to 50 percent of the units on a block may have the living area portion of the house set back no closer than 15 feet from the front property line; and, up to 25 percent of the units on a block may have garages set back no closer than 15 feet from the front property line, provided the garage is "side facing," and there is a minimum driveway length of at least 20 feet; and up to 25 percent of the units on a block may have covered porches extend up to 10 feet into the required front setback, provided the covered porch extends no closer than 10 feet to the front property line. Further, these provisions shall apply only to projects with houses fronting along roads that are designed and built using Ventura County Design Plate B-4 (parkway between curb and sidewalk). 
B.  Side yard setback requirements. 
1.  Applicability of setback requirements. The side yard setbacks in Table 2-3 shall only apply to projects with five units or more filed after January 5, 2006 (the effective date of the Development Code). For projects with four units or less filed after April 5, 2007: the minimum interior side yard setback shall be five feet for a single-story house and for a one-story element of a two-story house, and 10 feet for a two-story house, provided that the Commission determines that the less restrictive setbacks are compatible with the setbacks of adjacent residential developments. The minimum street-facing side yard setbacks shall be 10 feet for all structures, regardless of project size and number of stories. The side yard setbacks for existing houses and for projects deemed complete before January 5, 2006, shall be five feet for a single-story house, and six feet to 10 feet for a two-story house, or as approved by the Commission for that lot. The side yard setbacks are only applicable to single-family residential zones in RVL through RMod zones and do not apply to OS or RE zones. 
2.  Zero lot line projects. For a zero lot line development (or for any other single-family detached project with one side yard of less than six feet) the sum of both side yard setbacks shall add up to a minimum of 10 feet. For zero lot line projects processed as Planned Development permits, the lot shall retain the sum of both required side yards on one side. 
C.  Rear yard setback requirements. 
1.  Freeway setback. In all residential zones, where lots and uses back on to the State Route 118 Freeway, rear yard setbacks may be reduced to five feet for all structures, provided no structures shall cumulatively cover more than 40% of any yard. 
2.  The total cumulative length of an Accessory Dwelling Unit and all accessory structures may not be more than 50 percent of the width of the rear setback area. 
D.  Accessory structure height limits. A Conditional Use Permit shall be required to exceed the height limits established in Table 2-3. The maximum height of any accessory structure shall not exceed the maximum height permitted for a primary structure. Exceptions to this Section may be found for Accessory Dwelling Units in Section 9-44.160.

c.  Gas, electricity, and water shall be separately metered for each dwelling unit. A shutoff valve for each utility shall also be provided for each unit. 
2.  Development Code Standards. Conversion projects shall comply with the following Development Code requirements: 
a.  Provide similar roof treatments for garages or carports as the main structures, pursuant to Section 9-24.060(B)(1)(a);

3.  Design Guidelines. The following design guidelines are strongly encouraged for use when converting existing apartments to condominiums. ( Note: All condominium conversion design guidelines appear in italics to distinguish them from standards, which are mandatory requirements.) 
a.  Follow the landscape design standards found in the Citywide Landscape Guidelines; 
b.  Screen all above ground utility equipment and service meters visible from the street; 
c.  Provide an overall circulation system that avoids circuitous or confusing travel paths and dead ends; 
d.  Provide adequate vehicle stacking room and parking stalls outside of the gates, for gated projects; 
e.  Incorporate significant vertical and horizontal articulation into each building; and 
f.  Conversions designated for sale only to seniors should incorporate universal design guidelines. The term "accessible" is defined as pursuant to Chapter 11A of the California Building Code. The design features include: 
(1)  Doors, openings, and entries: 
(a)  Accessible primary front door, doorway, and threshold; 
(b)  Accessible interior doors and doorway; 
(c)  Accessible secondary exterior doors, doorways, and thresholds; 
(d)  An entry door sidelight or high and low peephole viewer;

(d)  Accessible faucet handles and an adjustable handheld showerhead; 
(e)  Enhancements such as a contrasting color edge at countertops, and antiscald device on plumbing fixtures; 
(5)  Project site. Required paths of travel must have a slip-resistant surface suitable for walkers and wheelchairs, such as concrete, mortarless interlocking pavers, or other smooth surfaces as approved by the Deputy Director/City Planner. 
F.  Vacancy rate. Condominium conversions shall be prohibited when the City's vacancy rate for rental apartments is less than five percent, as determined by the most recent Apartment Survey prepared by the City, at the time a conversion application is submitted. 
G.  Occupancy limitation. The CC&Rs for the project shall stipulate that each converted condominium unit be owner-occupied for an initial five-year time period, and that no more than 20 percent of the units may be rented at any time. 
H.  Affordable housing. The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City to sell 25 percent of the total number of units to very low- and low-income households. This agreement shall also ensure that all affordable units be sold with an affordability covenant that restricts the affordable housing cost for a minimum of 45 years. 
I.  Tenant benefits. 
1.  Moving expenses and relocation assistance. The applicant shall provide relocation/moving assistance equal to three times the monthly rent to any tenant household living in any unit of the project at the time of final map approval, provided such tenant is not otherwise in default of the rental agreement. A tenant moving into the apartment after final map approval will not be required to be provided with moving expenses. When the tenant has given notice of his intent to move prior to City approval of the final map, eligibility to receive assistance shall be forfeited. If the tenant elects to purchase a unit, such relocation assistance shall be applied to the tenant's purchase of the unit. 
2.  Lease extension. The applicant shall offer a three-year lease extension to qualifying very low- and low-income tenants, as defined by the latest publicly available figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for household incomes for the County of Ventura. Reasonable annual rent increase shall be allowed, but shall not exceed the increase in the Los Angeles-Long Beach Area Consumer Price Index (CPI), or any successor index designed to determine general increases in housing costs, for the preceding 12-month period. Provisions setting forth this limitation on rent increases shall be incorporated into such lease. The applicant shall provide evidence that such offer has been made to eligible tenants prior to filing for approval of the final subdivision map.

Chapter 9-26 - Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts 
 
9-26.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
This Chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the commercial and industrial zoning districts established by Section 9-20.020 (Zoning Districts Established), determines the type of land use permit approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site development. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-26.020 - Purposes of Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts 
The commercial and industrial zoning districts are intended to provide and maintain opportunities for a diversity of commercial enterprises. The purposes of the individual zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: 
A.  CO (Commercial Office) district. The CO zoning district is intended to provide areas for business and professional offices, related services, and other uses compatible with and especially sensitive to the surrounding land uses. 
B.  CN (Commercial Neighborhood) district. The CN zoning district is intended to provide a limited range of products and services to the residents of the surrounding neighborhood. Restrictions may be placed on permitted uses, hours of operation, intensity of use, lighting and delivery hours. 
C.  CR (Commercial Recreation) district. The CR zoning district is intended to provide for the development of recreational, entertainment, and associated retail and service activities meant to serve primarily the needs of the local population. 
D.  CC (Civic Center) district. The CC zoning district is intended to provide an area devoted primarily to public facilities and supportive commercial activities, and to encourage a concentration of these facilities in a centralized location. 
E.  CPD (Commercial Planned Development) district. The CPD zoning district is intended to encourage the development of attractive, innovative, and efficient commercial sites containing a broad range of retail, office and service commercial uses. 
F.  CI (Commercial Industrial) district. The CI zoning district is intended to provide an area combining light industrial uses with commercial activities that are frequently incompatible with conventional retail or office areas. 
G.  RCC (Regional Commercial Center) district. The RCC zoning district is intended to designate a site for an enclosed mall anchored by two or more major department stores with intervening specialty stores. 
H.  BP (Business Park) district. The BP zoning district is intended to provide areas for quality industrial development, together with supportive and compatible, but not necessarily accessory retail, office, and commercial uses, in unique geographic areas. Development and performance standards for this zoning district will be developed on a case-by-case basis through a required Specific Plan to protect the unique qualities of these areas while still providing development opportunities. 
I.  LI (Light Industrial) district. The LI zoning district is intended to provide areas for a variety of light manufacturing, service, technical research, and related business office uses, operating under performance standards which will result in very few outside impacts. 
J.  GI (General Industrial) district. The GI zoning district is intended to provide areas for a broad range of manufacturing and quasi-industrial activities, while providing appropriate safeguards for adjoining industrial property, nearby nonindustrial property, and the community in general. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-26.030 - Commercial, Industrial, Business Park Overlay, and Mixed-Use Overlay District Land Uses and Permit Requirements 
A.  General requirements. Table 2-5 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Development Code in the Commercial, Industrial, Business Park Overlay, and Mixed-Use Overlay Districts, and the Land Use Permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Chapter 9-22 (Land Use Permit Requirements). Regardless of the permit requirement established by Table 2-5, Planned Development Permit approval (Section 9-52.050) is also required for all new construction. 
Note: Where the last column in the tables ("Specific Use Regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use; however, provisions in other sections of this Development Code may also apply. 
B.  RCC and BP districts. Allowable land uses within the RCC and BP zoning districts shall be determined by the applicable Specific Plan. 
C.  Specific Plan (SP) Land Use Designations and Zoning Districts: Allowable land uses within Specific Plans shall be determined by the applicable specific plan, except that commercial nonmedicinal and medicinal cannabis uses, operations, and activities, including cultivation, dispensaries, distribution, deliveries, manufacturing, processing, microbusinesses, storing, laboratory testing, packaging, labeling, and transportation facilities or uses are prohibited in the City (refer to Chapter 5-41 for Nonmedicinal and Medicinal Cannabis Standards).

9-26.050 - Commercial and Industrial District Height Limit Exceptions 
The height limits established for certain zoning district by Table 2-6 may be modified in compliance with this Section. See also Section 9-30.060 (Height Limits and Exceptions) for additional exceptions applicable to all zoning districts. 
A.  Principal structure in the CO, CPD, or Industrial Zones - GI, LI, and CI. A multi-story structure exceeding 48 feet or three stories in height, measured as defined by the California Administrative Code Title 19, shall comply with all of the following standards: 
1.  Fire safety provisions. The structure shall be equipped with a Fire Department communication system and an automatic fire sprinkler system. 
2.  Helistop. A helistop shall be provided on a structure that exceeds 75 feet in height. 
3.  Setback requirements. Independent front, rear, internal, and side yards shall be provided, each with a minimum depth equal to the structure height. The Commission may deviate from these setback standards through the Conditional Use Permit process subject to making appropriate findings relating to either Subsection (A)(3)(a) or (b), below. When deviation from setback requirements is based upon a finding under either Subsection (A)(3)(a) or (b), below, the setback directly related to the finding shall be varied. For example, if the finding is based upon the proximity of the structure to the freeway, only the setback from the freeway may be modified. Other applicable rear, front or side yards with minimum depth equal to the structure height shall apply: 
a.  Deviations from setback requirements may be allowed because of proximity of the structure to the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway or another commercial/industrial building; 
b.  Deviations from setback requirements may be allowed because of an unusual lot configuration if one of the following findings is made: 
(1)  Strict application of the setback requirements applicable to structures that exceed 48 feet or exceeding three stories is not possible due to the size or shape of the lot, however the structure has been designed so that the underlying purposes of the setback requirement, i.e., effect on neighboring structures with respect to light, shadows, visibility, solar energy, ventilation, air, noise, safety or privacy, have been satisfied. 
(2)  A lot configuration that is such that compliance with the setback standards would result in the owner of the property being unable to make a reasonable use of his property in the manner and for the purposes which other property of like character in the same vicinity and zone can be used. 
4.  Traffic Study. A site specific traffic study evaluating traffic impacts of the development on the surrounding street system shall be submitted. The study shall include daily and peak hour traffic generation characteristics of the proposed development, turning movement and peak directional traffic projections, and a traffic volume to roadway capacity comparison at the current traffic level and at traffic levels associated with ultimate General Plan development. The study shall also include potential mitigation measures for projected traffic service levels lower than desirable levels of traffic service. 
B.  Principal structures in all zones other than CO, CN, and CPD. A proposed structure may exceed the height limits required by Table 2-6 for a commercial zoning district other than CO, CN, or CPD with Conditional Use Permit approval. To grant the permit, the Commission shall first find that additional height will be compatible with surrounding land uses, and the General Plan and not adversely impact the health, safety or welfare of surrounding property owners.

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
Chapter 9-28 - Overlay Zoning Districts*[] 

Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
* Prior ordinance history: Ord. 1085, effective January 6, 2006. 
 
9-28.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
This Chapter regulates new and existing structures and land uses in the overlay zoning districts established by Section 9-20.020 (Zoning Districts Established). The provisions of this Chapter provide guidance for development in addition to the standards and regulations of the primary zoning districts, where important site, environmental, safety, compatibility, or design issues require particular attention in project planning. 
(Amended during 3-07 supplement)  
9-28.020 - Applicability of Overlay Zoning Districts 
The provisions of this Chapter apply to proposed land uses and development in addition to all other applicable requirements of this Development Code. In the event of any perceived conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and any other provision of this Development Code, the most restrictive shall apply. 
A.  Mapping of overlay districts. The applicability of any overlay zoning district to a specific site is shown by the overlay Zoning Map symbol established by Section 9-20.020 (Zoning Districts Established) being appended as a suffix to the symbol for the primary zoning district (for example, RMod-FC). 
B.  Allowed land uses, permit requirements, and development standards. Except as may be otherwise provided for a specific overlay district: 
1.  Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district by this Development Code may be allowed within an overlay district, subject to any additional requirements of the overlay district; 
2.  Development and new land uses within an overlay district shall obtain the land use permits required by this Development Code for the primary zoning district; and 
3.  Development and new land uses within an overlay district shall comply with all applicable requirements of the primary zoning district. 
(Amended during 3-07 supplement)  
9-28.030 - Animal (A, L, and H) Overlay Districts 
A.  Purpose. The A (Farm Animal), L (Limited Farm Animal) and H (Horse) overlay zoning districts are intended to identify areas within the City where farm animals (for example, horses, cows, steers, bulls, pigs and swine, goats and sheep, bees, poultry and similar ground birds, rabbits and non-carnivorous fur-bearing animals, turkeys, and other birds) may be raised and maintained. These zones allow recognition of specific areas and developments within the City that are farm animal oriented because of their rural-like settings or common equestrian themes. These overlay zoning districts are intended to provide large discrete areas for the keeping of farm animals or horses only, that avoid the common incompatibility problems associated with animal keeping on isolated and dispersed parcels, and formally identify portions of the City that are intended to remain animal areas over the long term. 
B.  Allowed land uses. Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district may be allowed within the A, L, and H overlay districts subject to the land use permit requirements of the primary district. Animal keeping shall comply with the standards in Section 9-44.060 (Animal Keeping). 
C.  Development standards. Proposed development and new land uses within the A, L, and H overlay districts shall comply with all applicable requirements of the primary zoning district. Animal keeping shall comply with the standards in Section 9-44.060 (Animal Keeping). 
(Amended during 3-07 supplement)  
9-28.040 - Freeway Combining (FC) Overlay District 
A.  Purpose. The FC (Freeway Combining) overlay zoning district is intended to regulate residential development along the freeway corridor in an effort to minimize the number of people impacted by the negative elements of the freeway. The FC overlay zone is established in recognition of the fact that residential development near the Simi Valley Freeway requires special consideration in construction and design. These special standards are meant to provide acoustic and visual protection for residents of dwellings to be constructed within the freeway impacted area as well as enhance the appearance of the freeway corridor through the City. 
B.  Allowable land uses and permit requirements. Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district may be allowed within the FC overlay district subject to the land use permit requirements of the primary district. The following may also be allowed with Conditional Use Permit approval: 
1.  Commercial recreation facilities - indoor; 
2.  Commercial recreation facilities - outdoor; and 
3.  Dinner house restaurants. 
C.  Development standards. The following standards shall be implemented by the review authority primarily in terms of performance. The specific requirements for any particular property shall be determined by considering all of the information and the specific conditions which affect a particular site and mitigating those conditions to meet the following standards. 
Proposed development shall incorporate building and site planning techniques to decrease noise and air pollution impacts on residential uses within the FC overlay district. Materials used and design for exterior walls, windows, doors, and other structural components shall be constructed and installed to achieve the maximum protection from freeway generated noise and air pollution. 
1.  Exemption. The construction of one dwelling unit on a parcel that was legally recorded prior to July 21, 1986 shall not be required to meet the exterior noise standards of this Section. 
2.  Acoustical report. Plans submitted to the City for proposed residential development shall include an acoustical report prepared and certified by a qualified engineer. The report shall include a noise survey indicating present and 2020 projected noise levels on the proposed building site. Data shall include noise levels at peak hour and late evening/early morning time periods. If the readings are averaged, a maximum one-hour averaging period shall be used. The noise sample data shall be approved by City staff to verify that representative noise sampling points have been included. Noise mitigation measures shall be included as part of the development plans. Noise attenuation measures shall be identified (e.g., barriers, landscaping, separation distance, walls, etc.) in addition to identification of the dBA reduction provided by each measure. 
3.  Ambient noise levels. Ambient noise levels for new residential developments within the FC overlay district shall not exceed 60 dBA for exterior areas and 45 dBA for interior areas based on 2020 traffic projections. 
4.  Soundproofing. Structural soundproofing shall be provided for dwelling units that are projected to have a higher interior noise level than 45 dBA in 2020. The amount and type of wall, roof, and window soundproofing shall be sufficient to maintain a maximum ambient noise level in living areas no greater than 45 dBA using projected 2020 traffic figures, with all windows, doors and other openings closed. Soundproofing techniques shall include the following: 
a.  Where windows face the freeway or an access ramp, double-paned and double-strength windows, manufactured and installed to specifications that prevent any sound being generated by window vibration caused by heavy vehicle movement on the freeway; 
b.  Acoustically designed doors, with gasketed stops and an integral drop seal; 
c.  Insulation within the exterior walls of living areas that will provide a sufficiently high sound transmission class (STC) to lower the interior ambient noise level to 45 dBA; 
d.  Special soundproofing insulation and design features within roofs and ceilings to meet the 45 dBA interior ambient noise level requirement; and 
e.  Air conditioning to serve all living areas in all new dwellings within 250 feet of the freeway right-of-way. Dwellings beyond 250 feet but within 700 feet of the right-of-way shall be designed so that spaces for furnaces and utility ducts are large enough to accommodate the future installation of central air conditioning. 
D.  Development guidelines. 
1.  Landscape/wall buffering. Development adjacent to the freeway and freeway access ramps should provide decorative block walls, dense landscaping, and mounding/earth berms within a buffer strip where determined by the Review Authority to be appropriate, to ensure the maximum protection from freeway-generated noise and particulate emissions. The specific standards for landscape buffer strip widths, wall and planting heights, and other improvements should be determined during the City's development review process. Applicants and the City should coordinate landscape buffering plans with Caltrans. Applicants should also consult with the City's Landscape Architect regarding appropriate plant materials and planting locations. 
2.  Project design. Site design and placement of dwelling units should consider noise impacts and views from the dwellings units to the freeway. Structures should be located on the site in a manner that will protect them from noise impacts and undesirable freeway views to the maximum extent feasible, as determined by the Review Authority based on substantial evidence provided by the Applicant. Noise sensitive rooms such as bedrooms should be located as far away from the freeway corridor as possible by placing nonresidential land uses such as parking lots, storage and utility areas adjacent to the freeway corridor. Applicants should cluster dwelling units where appropriate to create additional common open space to be used to increase the buffer between dwelling units and the freeway corridor.

9-28.080 - Mixed-Use (MU) Overlay District 
The purpose of the MU Overlay District designation is to create opportunities within the City to provide for a compatible mix of land uses, including residential, retail, and offices. The Mixed-Use Overlay allows properties to be developed with commercial retail or offices uses on the ground floor and housing on the second floor or above; a mix of differing land uses distributed horizontally on a site; or a single land use, as designated on the Community Subareas and Districts Maps (refer to Figures 2-4, 2-5, and 2-6). Mixed-Use developments strengthen the City's economic base, foster pedestrian-oriented activity, and reduce the need for automobile travel by providing a variety of goods, services, and jobs within walking distance of residences. The MU Overlay prescribes the boundaries of the area within which a specialized set of design standards and guidelines shall apply. The goal is to achieve high quality, pedestrian-oriented development through innovative application of the Citywide Design Guidelines, Residential Design Guidelines, and Landscape Design Guidelines. This zone in no way modifies the land uses permitted by the underlying zoning, except that properties that are developed for a mixture of commercial and residential uses (rather than a single-use development) must meet the standards for the Mixed-Use Overlay District, which are listed in Section 9-44.105. Single-use developments must meet development standards prescribed for that land use type (i.e., commercial retail development must meet all required commercial development standards).

For signs abutting residential zones, the hours of operation are limited to 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. For all other locations of Electronic Changeable Copy Signs within the NVD Overlay District, the signs must be text only and comply with SVMC Section 9-37.050 (G) "Electronic changeable copy sign standards." 
c.  The maximum brightness of Electronic Changeable Copy Signs must not exceed an illumination of 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours, and must not exceed 500 nits between dusk to dawn, as measured from the sign's face at maximum brightness. The sign must be equipped with both a dimmer control and a photocell, which automatically adjusts the display's intensity according to ambient daylight conditions. Prior to the issuance of a sign permit, the applicant must provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has been factory pre-set not to exceed 5,000 nits and that the intensity level is protected from end-user manipulation as deemed appropriate by the Director. 
4.  Corporate architecture. Appropriate corporate architecture is allowed in the NVD Overlay District, in order to promote corporate identities and to encourage regional competition with other dealers outside the area. By allowing vehicle dealer franchise designs, it increases the visibility of the NVD Overlay District and separates this area from the surrounding commercial areas. 
(§ 3, Ord. 1129, eff. June 5, 2008 as amended by § 2 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1194, eff. July 19, 2012, and § 2 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1212, eff. May 9, 2013)

9-30.060 - Height Limits and Exceptions 
A.  Purpose. This Section describes the required methods for measuring the height of structures in compliance with the height limits established by this Development Code, and exceptions to those height limits. 
B.  Maximum height of structures. The height of each structure shall not exceed the height limit established for the applicable zoning district by Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), or a height limit established for a specific land use or structure by Article 4 (Standards for Specific Land Uses) except as otherwise provided by this Section. 
C.  Height measurement. The maximum allowable height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average of the highest and lowest points of the portion of the site adjacent to the building, whether natural or paved surface, to the topmost point of the structure, excluding chimneys or vents. See Figure 3-4. 
 
Figure 3-4. Height Measurement 
D.  Exceptions to height limits. 
1.  Roof structures (including mechanical penthouses, chimneys, vents) may exceed the height limits required by the applicable zoning district provided that no additional floor space for the principal use is thereby created. 
2.  The height of an existing residence or residential accessory structure may be increased up to 10% in height, when it is in the Valley Floor, the site is developed as a detached single-family use, the roof has a minimum slope of 25% (3:12), and the slope increases in height from all property lines. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006, as amended by § 2 (part), Ord. 1110, eff. April 6, 2007 and § 2 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1183, eff. March 15, 2012)

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-30.080 - Setback and Separation Requirements and Exceptions 
A.  Purpose. This Section provides standards for the use and minimum size of setbacks. These standards provide open areas around structures for: visibility and traffic safety; access to and around structures; access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight; separation of incompatible land uses; and space for privacy, landscaping and recreation. 
B.  Setback requirements. 
1.  General requirement. Each structure shall comply with the setback requirements of the applicable zoning district, and with any setbacks established for specific uses by this Article, except as otherwise provided by this Section. No portion of a structure, including eaves or roof overhangs, shall extend beyond a property line; or into an access easement or street right-of-way, without first being authorized by an Encroachment Permit. 
2.  Distance between structures on the same lot (interior setbacks). The minimum distance between structures on the same lot shall be six feet as measured between the closest exterior walls and/or columns, except that no principal structure shall be placed closer than 10 feet to any other principal structure; if more than one story, minimum distance shall be twenty (20) feet. 
C.  Measurement of setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured as follows, provided that whenever this Development Code refers to a setback distance from a street, and the street in question is a public street, the setback shall be measured from the ultimate right-of-way width as shown in the General Plan. See Figure 3-5. In the case of a site with a perimeter wall, the property lot line shall be presumed to be the perimeter wall, unless shown otherwise by a surveyor. 
 
Figure 3-5. Location and Measurement of Setbacks 
1.  Front setback. A required front setback shall be measured into a lot from the front property line (or edge of the right-of-way where the property line is at the center of the street), extending the full width of the lot between the side lot lines intersecting the front lot line. 
2.  Street side yard setback. A required street side setback shall be measured into a lot from any side property line (or edge of the right-of-way where the property line is at the center of the street) that abuts a street, extending between the front and rear setbacks. 
3.  Side setback. A required interior side setback shall be measured into a lot from a side lot line, extending between the front and rear setbacks. 
4.  Rear setback. A required rear setback shall be measured into a lot from the rear lot line, extending between the side lot lines intersecting the rear lot line; provided that: 
a.  For lots having no defined rear lot line, the rear setback shall be measured into the lot from the rearmost point of the lot depth to a line parallel to the front lot line; and 
b.  In computing the depth of a rear setback for any lot abutting an alley, the setback may be measured from the midpoint of the rear alley. 
5.  Flag lot setbacks. In the case of a flag lot, the required setbacks shall be measured from the applicable front, rear, and sides of the lot as shown in Figure 3-6. 
 
Figure 3-6. Flag Lot Setbacks

9-30.090 - Undergrounding of Utilities 
Existing and new overhead utility facilities shall be converted to, or installed as, underground utilities in compliance with this Section. 
A.  Applicability. No Zoning Clearance shall be issued for any construction of a new structure or land development unless the applicant's plans comply with the provisions of this Section. 
B.  Definitions. Definitions of the technical or specialized terms and phrases used in this Section may be found in Article 8. 
C.  Requirements for undergrounding. All utilities servicing a new structure or servicing any existing structure located on the same parcel of land as a new structure shall be installed or relocated underground, except as otherwise exempted in this Section. Relocation of existing overhead utility service to an off-site location is not permitted. 
Utility lines, such as electric distribution (under 33,000 volts), communications, street lighting and cable television, shall be placed underground by the applicant, who shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies for the installation of such facilities. Existing utility poles on the project site shall be removed and undergrounding of all overhead service not directly affecting service to adjacent sites shall be accomplished to the nearest existing off-site pole as determined by the City Engineer. New poles may be set only in special instances where no other feasible solution is available as determined by the utility company. 
D.  Exemptions from undergrounding requirements. The following types of facilities are exempt from the undergrounding requirements of this Section. 
1.  Poles, overhead wires and associated utility services used for electricity transmission at a nominal voltage of 33,000 volts or higher. 
2.  Appurtenant structures and equipment, including surface mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets. 
3.  Temporary poles, overhead wires and associated utility services used or to be used in conjunction with construction projects. 
4.  Temporary poles, overhead wires and associated utility services for a temporary use, when a Temporary Use Permit has been issued, and when the permit requires removal of the temporary utility service upon completion of the temporary use. 
5.  Public utilities doing work governed by the rules, regulations and tariffs of the California Public Utilities Commission. 
6.  Emergency poles, overhead wires, and utility services to be installed and maintained for a period not to exceed 10 days, with the approval of the City Engineer. 
7.  Whenever an undergrounding utility district has already been formed or is projected to be formed in compliance with Municipal Code Title 7, Chapter 4, Section 7 4.01 et seq. 
8.  Whenever an unreasonable hardship has been established by the Planning Commission in compliance with Subsection F. 
E.  In-lieu fee. When a project does not qualify for one of the exemptions listed in Subsection D, above, and the Commission has granted relief from undergrounding in conjunction with a request for construction under Subsection F, an in-lieu fee may be established based on front footage costs estimated by the Southern California Edison Company. The City Engineer shall collect the in-lieu fees and manage and adjust the fees for inflation as deemed necessary. 
F.  Hardship waiver - In-lieu fees. If the cost of placing utility services underground is so great as to constitute an unreasonable hardship, the property owner, subject to the undergrounding requirement, may apply in writing to the approving body for relief from the provisions of this Section. The request shall include a detailed description of the overhead utility services proposed to be placed underground and separate itemized cost estimates of construction of the project if the utilities were placed or relocated underground or above ground. 
1.  Unreasonable hardship findings. After considering the request for relief, the approving body may grant relief as may be deemed proper under the circumstances, including the imposition of in-lieu fees or the indefinite deferral of the undergrounding requirement. The approving body may grant this relief only if the approving body makes all of the following findings, each of which are supported by substantial facts: 
a.  The cost of undergrounding utilities exceeds 20 percent of the total project cost, including all on- and off-site improvements and structures, with valuation to be determined using the currently adopted valuation tables of the Building Official and the Public Works Department; 
b.  No new utility poles are to be erected; 
c.  There is another overhead utility service in the immediate vicinity which would remain even if no waiver is granted; and 
d.  The grant of approval would not be inconsistent with the intent and purposes of this Chapter. 
2.  Deferral. The approving body may grant a deferral of the requirements to underground utilities, by requiring a deed restriction to be recorded against the property concurrent with recordation of the final map or prior to issuance of a zoning clearance. The deed restriction will require the current or future property owner to accept any future assessment proceedings for undergrounding the existing onsite overhead utilities. This deferral may only be granted by the approving body if the undergrounding of existing overhead utility services would require the installation of more guy poles than the number of existing utility poles required to be removed. The determination regarding the need for additional guy poles shall be verified by the appropriate utility company. 
3.  Appeal of approving body decision. Any decision of the approving body concerning a hardship waiver request under this Section may be appealed by any interested person in compliance with Chapter 9-76 (Appeals), and as follows. 
a.  Appeal requirements. The appeal shall contain the following information: 
(1)  A detailed description of the overhead utility services proposed to be placed underground; 
(2)  A separate itemized cost estimate for: the construction valuation of the project certified by the Building Official; the construction costs of the utilities to be placed underground; and, if applicable, the construction costs of utilities to be relocated above ground; and 
(3)  The grounds for the appeal. 
b.  Granting of the appeal. Upon consideration of the appeal, the appeal body may grant relief as it may deem proper under the circumstances, including indefinite deferral of the undergrounding requirement. The appeal may be granted if the appeal body is able to make all of the findings of Subsection (F)(1), each of which is supported by substantial facts.

Chapter 9-31 - Density Bonus/Affordable Housing Provisions[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1157, adopted June 21, 2010, eff. July 22, 2010, repealed the former Chapter 9-31, §§ 9-31.0109-31.070, and enacted a new Chapter 9-31 as set out herein. The former Chapter 9-31 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006. 
 
9-31.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
The purpose of this Chapter is to identify the standards and regulations under which density bonuses and other incentives may be offered by the City to developers of Housing Development projects in compliance with State Law (Government Code Section 65915 et seq.). Neither State Law nor this Chapter require the provision of direct financial incentives for housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. 
(Exh. A, Ord. 1157, eff. July, 22, 2010)  
9-31.020 - Density Bonus, Incentives and Concessions, Waivers 
A.  Granting of density bonus. 
1.  Density Bonus. When a developer agrees to build a Housing Development, the City shall grant a density bonus based upon the following table: 
Density Bonus 
Income Category 	Min. percent of affordable units 	Bonus to be granted 	Additional 
bonus for each 1% increase in affordable units above the minimum 	Total maximum bonus 
Very Low-Income 	5% 	20% 	2.5% 	35% 
Low-Income 	10% 	20% 	1.5% 	35% 
Moderate-Income (for-sale common interest development only) 	10% 	5% 	1% 	35% 
100% Senior Citizen Housing Development or Senior Citizen Mobile Home Park 	100% 	20% 	N/A 	20% 
 
2.  Additional Density. Density bonus in excess of the maximum specified in Section A.1 above is at the sole discretion of the City Council and may be approved only for housing developments affordable to low- and very low-income households upon the applicant demonstrating to the City Council that the project includes additional project benefits such as those included in the following non-exclusive list. However, in no event shall the total density of the site, including density bonus units, exceed 45 dwelling units per acre for non-age restricted housing developments and 50 dwelling units per acre for age restricted housing developments. 
a.  The project is designed to a minimum of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards. 
b.  The project is ¼ mile or less from a transit stop. 
c.  The project provides 50% or more of its paving surfaces as permeable. 
d.  Trees are selected to be summer shading and planted in locations that achieve energy efficiencies through reducing the heat island effect by shading a minimum of 30% of paved surfaces at five years growth. 
e.  There is at least a 25% increase in outdoor common areas and recreational space above that which would be required in the offset of a Cluster Development Permit. 
f.  All units include at least 300 cubic feet of storage area by increasing the garage size over the minimum size required by the City's Development Code or providing private accessory storage areas. 
g.  A community room of no less than 400 square feet is provided on-site. 
3.  General Provisions. 
a.  The applicant can select from only one of the income categories for which they seek a bonus density. The applicant cannot combine bonuses from different income categories. 
b.  When calculating the number of permitted bonus or affordable units, any calculations resulting in fractional units must be rounded to the next larger whole number. 
c.  The density bonus units may not be included when determining the number of affordable units necessary to qualify for a density bonus. 
[ As an example, a residential project for which a density of 100 dwelling units would otherwise be allowable under the zoning will qualify for a 20% density bonus by providing 10% or 10 dwelling units as affordable to low-income households. With the density bonus, the total project size will be 120 dwelling units, of which 10 dwelling units must be affordable to low-income households, and 20 dwelling units are the density bonus units. ] 
d.  An applicant may request a lesser density bonus than the bonus to which a project is entitled, but no reduction will be permitted in the number of affordable units required. 
e.  The granting of any density bonus, incentive, or concession shall not in and of itself require the need for a general plan amendment, zone change, or other discretionary approval. 
f.  Applicants shall ensure continued affordability and/or age restrictions of units as follows: 
i.  The developer shall enter into a written Affordable Agreement or Senior Agreement with the City to either ensure continued affordability of the units or to maintain the availability of all senior units for a period of not less than 55 years. 
ii.  Rents for the low-income units shall be set at an affordable rent. 
iii.  Owner-occupied affordable units shall be available at an Affordable Housing Cost. 
g.  When an applicant for a residential development approval donates land to the City for affordable housing, the housing development may be eligible for an additional density bonus, as specified in Government Code Section 65915(g). 
h.  A residential development which contains the requisite number of affordable units pursuant to the requirements of this Chapter and which contains a childcare facility may be eligible for an additional density bonus or incentive, as specified in Government Code Section 65915(h). 
i.  Condominium conversions qualifying as a Housing Project and containing the requisite number of affordable units may be eligible for a density bonus or incentive as specified in Government Code Section 65915.5. 
B.  Granting of Incentives or Concessions. 
1.  Quantity of Incentives or Concessions. When a developer agrees to build a housing development, the City shall grant incentives or concessions based upon the following table: 
Requirements to Qualify for Incentives or Concessions 
Income category 	Minimum percentage of units 
needed to qualify for incentives or concessions 
Very Low-Income 	5% 	10% 	15% 
Low-Income 	10% 	20% 	30% 
Moderate-Income (for-sale common interest development only) 	10% 	20% 	30% 
Maximum Allowable Number of Incentives or Concessions 	1 	2 	3 
 
2.  Types of Concessions/Incentives. The following is an exclusive list of the concessions/incentives that may be requested: 
a.  Up to a 20% reduction in any of the following setbacks (each reduction is one concession): 
i.  Front yard setback. 
ii.  Rear yard setback. 
iii.  Side yard setback. 
iv.  Accessory structure setback. 
b.  Up to a 20% increase in the maximum allowed building height. 
c.  Up to a 20% decrease in on-site allowed structure separation (each individual building separation is one concession). 
d.  Up to a 20% decrease in minimum lot sizes. 
e.  Increase in allowed duplex units up to a maximum of 40% of the total number of units in the project. 
f.  Up to a 10% reduction in the required length of the driveway in front of the required garage parking. 
g.  Up to a 20% reduction in the required rear open yard area. 
h.  Up to a 20% increase in the maximum front yard paved area. 
3.  Decline to Grant. The City may decline to grant a requested incentive or concession if written findings based upon substantial evidence are made by the City Council stating any of the following: 
a.  The incentive or concession is not necessary in order to provide for affordable housing costs or affordable rents for the targeted units as defined in State Law. 
b.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. 
c.  The concession or incentive would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. 
d.  The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal Law. 
C.  Waivers. An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 9-31.020.A.1 of this Chapter, exclusive of any additional density bonus that may be granted under Section 9-31.020.A.2, or with the concession or incentives permitted under Section 9-31.020.B of this Chapter, and may request a meeting with the City. Projects only qualify for a waiver if no feasible design alternatives or product types are available to construct the housing development in compliance with the development standard(s) requested to be waived. The City may decline to grant a requested waiver if: 
1.  The development standard for which a waiver is requested does not physically preclude the construction of the development of the project at the density allowed by Section 9-31.020.A.1 of this Chapter (exclusive of any additional density bonus allowed under Section 9-31.020.A.2 of this Chapter) or this allowed density can be obtained by altering the site design or product type proposed by the applicant; 
2.  The waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Government Code Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact; 
3.  The waiver or reduction of a development standard would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources; or 
4.  The waiver or reduction would be contrary to State or Federal Law.

The purposes of the performance standards set forth in this Article, therefore, are to implement those provisions of the General Plan as they relate to the preservation of hillside areas, the promotion of single-family, detached housing in hillside areas, the maintenance of open space, the retention of scenic and recreational resources of the City, and to further enhance the public health, safety, or welfare by regulating development in hillside areas. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.020 - Applicability 
Except as exempted in Section 9-32.040 of this Chapter, the performance standards set forth in this Article shall apply to any parcel or any portion of a parcel of land in any land use zone which is located outside of the valley floor boundary line as noted on the Development Map of the Valley Floor following this Article and made a part of this Article by this reference as Exhibits A and B. All principally and conditionally permitted uses in the underlying zone are likewise principally and conditionally permitted under these performance standards subject to the findings (Section 9-32.050 of this Article), and the application of the development standards (Section 9-32.100 of this Chapter) contained in this Article. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.030 - Variances from Performance Standards 
Variances from the terms of this Article shall be granted either pursuant to the procedures of Section 9-52.090 (Variances) or as part of a planned development permit, cluster development permit, special use permit, specific plan, or other entitlement provided the findings required by this Section are made prior to the approval of the project. Any variance granted shall be subject to the findings required by Section 9-52.090 (Variances), including, but not limited to, an express finding that the granting of the variance will serve the interests of preserving and protecting the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.040 - Exceptions 
The performance standards set forth in this Article shall not apply to those specific developments or applications involving one or more of the following circumstances: 
A.  Any approved permit, including, but not limited to, a specific plan, planned development permit, cluster development permit, vesting tentative map, tentative map, parcel map, special use permit, variance, sign variance, building permit, grading permit, encroachment permit, or other entitlement valid as of July 21, 1986. This shall include any such entitlement for which a minor modification is approved. However, prior to the Director approving or conditionally approving the minor modification, he shall submit the application to the Commission for a determination of whether the application meets the criteria of Section 9-52.030 (Administrative Adjustments) of this Code. If the Commission so determines, this exception shall apply to any such subsequently approved minor modification, unless the Director, or the Commission on appeal, or the Council on further appeal finds any modification to such entitlements to be a major modification of such a magnitude as to alter the original intent of the project approval; 
B.  Any reapplication for a previously-approved planned development permit, tentative map, or any other entitlement valid as of July 21, 1986, where the failure of the project to proceed under the original entitlement is solely caused by the failure to obtain the necessary building permit allocations in spite of having filed a good faith application therefore and that such reapplication does not contain any modification to the original entitlement of such a magnitude as to alter the original intent of the project approval; 
C.  The construction of a residential dwelling unit, or additions thereto, and accessory buildings on a legally subdivided, residentially-zoned parcel as of July 21, 1986, which does not involve grading for structures on visually prominent ridgelines or on land with a slope in excess of 20 percent or grading in excess of 1,000 cubic yards; 
D.  Any parcel having only isolated land forms with slopes of 10 percent or greater which have a horizontal run of less than 100 feet and a vertical rise of less than 30 feet; 
E.  Any parcel involving a sanitary landfill operation, landfill related gas recovery and collection systems, and ancillary electrical power generating and transportation facilities, as well as equipment storage, administrative facilities, and ancillary improvements related to a landfill, all of which are subject to government permits; provided, however, such exemption shall not apply to landfills which receive hazardous wastes as defined in Section 25117 of Title 22 of the California Administrative Code, as amended; 
F.  Grading for agricultural purposes pursuant to a grading permit reviewed by the Commission following a duly-noticed public hearing;

9-32.050 - Findings 
These findings constitute a further definition and implementation of those policies of the General Plan which relate to the preservation of hillside areas, the preservation of open space, and the protection of life and property in hillside areas subject to various natural and man-made hazards. In approving or conditionally approving any application for development subject to the performance standards set forth in this Article, the Director, the Commission, or the Council shall affirmatively find that all the following hillside development policies have been attained by the proposal. In denying any application for development subject to such performance standards, the Director, the Commission, or the Council on appeal shall state which of the following hillside development policies, if any, have not been attained. The manner in which the findings are listed is not to be construed as giving one finding priority over the other: 
A.  General findings. 
1.  That the natural topographic features of the hills surrounding the City have been respected and protected; 
2.  That all development in the project has been kept from natural slope areas of 20 percent or greater, except as specifically authorized pursuant to Sections 9-32.030 and 9-32.110(A) of this Chapter;

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.060 - Slope Calculation Procedure 
A.  Slope calculations. For the purposes of the performance standards set forth in this Article, the following methods will be used to determine the slope of any land and the square footage or acreage within any slope category on land subject to the performance standards: 
1.  Definition of slope. Slope is defined as the relationship between the change in elevation (rise) of the land and the horizontal distance (run) over which that change in elevation occurs. The percent of any given slope is determined by dividing the rise by the run on the natural slope of land, multiplied by 100. See figure following Subsection (A)(2) of this Section. 
2.  Slope map required. For the purpose of determining the amount and location of land falling into each slope category, the applicant shall submit to the Department of Environmental Services at the time of an application a base topographical map of the subject site prepared and signed by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor. Such map shall have a scale of not less than one inch to 200 feet and a contour interval of not more than two feet, provided the contour interval may be 10 feet when the slope is more than 20 percent. Such base topographical map shall include all adjoining properties within 150 feet of the site boundaries. Slope bands in the range of zero to 10 percent, 10 percent to 15 percent, 15 percent to 20 percent, and 20 percent or greater shall include, or be accompanied by, a tabulation of the land area in each slope category specified in acres. The exact method for computing the percent slope and area by percent slope category should be sufficiently described and presented so that a review can readily be made. 
 
3.  Slope mapping method. 
a.  The percent slope of any particular piece of land shall be plotted on the map described in Subsection (A)(2) of this Section by dividing the vertical rise between the contours employed by the horizontal distance between the same contours, multiplied by 100. The minimum contour interval employed shall be two feet, and the maximum contour interval employed 10 feet, with the 10-foot interval being preferred. 
b.  In preparing a slope map, isolated slope areas (that is, surrounded by a flatter or steeper slope category) with a horizontal run of less than 100 feet and a vertical rise of less than 30 feet shall be disregarded and the area thereof classified as being within the adjacent category. If the isolated slope area is adjacent to two or more slope categories, the isolated slope area shall be classified with the steepest adjacent slope category. 
c.  In preparing a slope map, those portions of ravines, ridges, and terraces of less than 150 feet in width at their widest measurement which are in an area generally sloping at 20 percent slope or greater shall be regarded as being of 20 percent slope or greater and shall be included as part of the bordering 20 percent slope or greater band. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.070 - Calculation of Total Allowable Dwelling Units 
A.  Land areas included in calculations. The total allowable residential dwelling units shall be calculated based on the total land area within each slope category pursuant to Subsection A of Section 9-32.060 (Slope calculation procedures) of this Article. Except for the exclusions specified in Subsection C of this Section, all land areas, including group open space, park and recreation areas developed by the applicant and designed principally for use by the occupants of the proposal, lands dedicated to the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District pursuant to the Parkland Dedication Ordinance, dedicated or otherwise reserved natural areas within the site, and lands within the proposed development required for new or expanded public rights-of-way for roadways may be included in the calculations of total allowable dwelling units if the land area is designated for residential development on the General Plan. Such areas shall be calculated as open space [one unit per 40 acres] if they are designated as Open Space on the General Plan. 
B.  Land areas included in calculations but unbuildable. Isolated land areas shall be considered unbuildable but may be included in the calculations of allowable numbers of dwelling units (gross density) for the entire site being considered if: 
1.  The provisions of Section 9-32.060(A)(3)(b) or (c) (Slope calculation procedures) of this Article or Subsection C of this Section do not apply; and 
2.  A public roadway shall be constructed which traverses natural slopes in excess of 20 percent for more than 100 feet per dwelling unit requiring such access. 
C.  Exceptions. Lands meeting any or all of the following criteria shall not be included in the calculation of total allowable dwelling units: 
1.  All land areas, regardless of slope, which will be subject to inundation during a 100-year storm after development has occurred; 
2.  All land which is in a geologic hazard area as defined in the Safety Element of the General Plan and for which no feasible mitigation measures are proposed consistent with the performance standards set forth in this Article; and 
3.  All land which will lie within the easement or right-of-way boundaries of an open flood control channel after development has occurred. 
D.  Residential dwelling unit calculations. Using the slope map described in Section 9-32.060(A) (Slope calculation procedure) of this Chapter, the maximum allowable number of units shall be calculated as follows: 
TABLE 3-3 - MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DWELLINGS 
Slope Category 	Dwellings Units per Acre 
0-10 Percent 	Underlying General Plan designation at target density or 7 units per acre, whichever is less. 
10-15 Percent 	1 unit per 2 acre (2 units per acre) or target density, whichever is less. 
15-20 Percent 	1 unit per 4 acres (0.25 units per acre) 
20+ Percent 	1 unit per 40 acres (0.025 unit per acre) 
Areas General Planned as Open Space 	1 unit per 40 acres (0.025 unit per acre; applies in all slope categories) 
 
E.  Transfer of dwelling unit allocations. Within a tentative map, Planned Development Permit, vested tentative map, or any other applicable entitlement, dwelling unit allocations within the applicable slope category may be utilized pursuant to Subsection D of this Section or may be transferred to other slope categories of less than 20 percent. Residential sites shall only be developed with single-family, detached units with a maximum density of seven units per acre, except for the following: 
1.  Senior citizen housing; 
2.  Residential projects located on a parcel not visible from viewpoints from the valley floor as defined in Section 9-32.150(C)(2) of this Chapter and containing at least 25 percent of the units which are affordable for low income and very low income households, as defined by the Housing Element of the General Plan (which, as of February, 1986, or as amended from time to time, was established for a family of four as an annual income of Sixteen Thousand Seven Hundred and No/100ths ($16,700.00) Dollars or less for very low and Twenty-Six Thousand Seven Hundred and No/100ths ($26,700.00) Dollars or less for low) and which do not exceed a maximum density of ten (10) units per gross acre, including density bonus and density transfer. 
In no event shall the exceptions set forth in this Subsection exceed the 20 percent slope restrictions. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.080 - Commercial and Industrial Development 
The development of parcels within a commercial or industrial land use zone shall comply with all of the provisions of the underlying base and overlay zone and all provisions of the performance standards set forth in this Article, provided such development is limited to slopes of 10 percent or less, unless otherwise approved by the West End Specific Plan or any amendment thereto, in which case development shall be limited to slopes of 20 percent or less. In addition, the approval and development of two, two to five acre commercial developments north of the map boundary and one, two to five acre commercial development south of the boundary shall not be deemed prohibited by this Section provided such development is restricted to those area having slopes of 10 percent or less, and such developments will not be visible from viewpoints from the valley floor as defined by Section 9-32.150(C)(2) of this Article. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.090 - Subdivisions of Land 
In order to avoid the creation of undevelopable parcels of land, any subdivision of land proposed in areas falling wholly or partially under the provisions of the performance standards set forth in this Article shall not be divided in such a fashion as to preclude the reasonable use of any resulting parcel. 
A.  Developable land may not be divided from land substantially undevelopable under the provisions of the performance standards, unless: 
1.  The undevelopable parcel is to be held in common by the owner of the resulting developable parcel; or 
2.  The undevelopable parcel is conveyed to and accepted by an appropriate public agency or other party (for example, homeowner's association) to be used for other residential purposes, such as, but not limited to, parks, flood control facilities, campgrounds, agriculture, or other uses consistent with the Open Space Element of the General Plan; and 
3.  An open space easement over the undevelopable parcel specifying the allowable nonresidential, or, alternatively, the proscribed uses, is dedicated to the City or another appropriate public agency. Such an open space easement shall be conveyed subject to the provisions of Sections 51070 et seq. of the Government Code. 
B.  If a parcel of land is proposed for division into two or more parcels, but with no cluster development permit or planned development permit for the whole original parcel, each parcel shall have a proportionate share of the total developable land or the total dwelling units allowable under the provisions of the performance standards, unless either Subsection (A)(1) or (2) of this Section has been satisfied. 
(Example: If four lots are to be created from 40 acres, each approximately 10 acres in size, each lot shall have 25 percent of the developable land and/or 25 percent of the total units allowable on the original parcel.) 
C.  Any parcel created pursuant to the provisions of the performance standards and entirely in 20 percent or greater slope, or designated as open space in the General Plan, shall be no less than 40 acres in size, unless Subsection (A)(1) or (2) of this Section pertains. 
D.  Single parcels of land of record as of July 21, 1986, in a residential or open space land use zone on less than 40 acres shall be allowed a minimum of one dwelling unit, notwithstanding Section 9-32.070 of this Chapter. 
E.  Land, otherwise developable under the provisions of the performance standards, is rendered undevelopable when the development which could be built on such land is transferred elsewhere on the parcel subject to the same development application, in such a case, the land rendered undevelopable shall be treated in a manner consistent with Subsection A of this Section. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.100 - Development Standards 
The purpose of this Section is to further define and describe the meaning of findings (Section 9-32.050 of this Chapter) and to implement the same. The following development standards are, therefore, the minimum criteria by which to evaluate the achievement of the findings (Section 9-32.050 of this Chapter) of the performance standards by any proposal, plan, or similar action subject to the provisions of the performance standards. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.110 - Grading Standards 
In addition to Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code, Chapter 7 of the Ventura County Land Development Manual, or any other applicable grading requirements, the following grading standards shall apply to all grading of land subject to the regulations of this Article (if more than 1,000 cubic yards): 
A.  No manufactured slope shall exceed 30 feet in height, [except that slopes required for public streets may exceed 30 feet in height if no feasible alternative consistent with the findings (Section 9-1.1605 of this Article) exists]. The height of a manufactured slope shall include the height of any retaining wall constructed as an integral part of such slope. 
B.  Where grading is necessary, the principles of contour grading shall be employed. 
1.  Manufactured slopes shall be rounded and shaped to simulate the natural terrain. 
2.  The toe and crest of any slope in excess of 10 feet vertical height, excepting the toe of any slope within 25 feet of a structure, shall be rounded with vertical curves of radii no less than five feet and designed in proportion to the total height of the slope. 
3.  Any manufactured slope bank in excess of 30 feet vertical shall have variable gradients. 
4.  Grading shall follow the natural topographic contours as much as possible. 
5.  Where cut or fill slopes exceed 200 feet in horizontal length, the horizontal contours of the slope shall be curved in a continuous, undulating fashion with varying radii to reflect the natural terrain. 
6.  Manufactured slopes shall blend with naturally occurring slopes at a radius compatible with the existing natural terrain. 
7.  Grading on naturally occurring slopes of 20 percent grade or more which have a vertical height of more than 30 feet and a horizontal run of 100 feet or more shall not occur unless the grading becomes necessary and is specifically approved by the Commission or Council after making the findings. A detailed plan for slope stabilization shall be submitted by the applicant. 
C.  No manufactured slope shall have a slope angle steeper than two horizontal to one vertical. Shallower slope angles may be required if detailed soils and geologic investigations indicate such. 
D.  Manufactured slopes should be screened from view under or behind buildings or by intervening landscaping or natural topographic features. 
E.  At the time of a formal application, a preliminary grading plan shall be submitted detailing the extent and nature of the proposed grading. Such a plan should include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Preliminary cross sections detailing both the original and proposed ground surfaces with grades, slopes, and elevations noted; 
2.  A preliminary soil stabilization report, including the proposed final ground cover, landscaping, and erosion control; and 
3.  Erosion control measures to prevent soil loss when grading is in process. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.120 - Drainage Standards 
All proposed drainage facilities shall respect the natural (before development) hydrologic characteristics of the subject terrain, preserve major drainage channels in their natural state, and be designed in such a manner as to preserve the public health, safety, or welfare. The provisions of the following standards shall apply to all land subject to the regulations of this Article and shall be in addition to the provisions of the adopted version of the Uniform Building Code, Chapters 6 and 7 of the Ventura County Land Development Manual, or any other applicable drainage requirements: 
A.  To the maximum feasible extent, all natural drainage courses serving major drainage areas and containing significant perennial vegetation which may constitute a significant wildlife habitat should remain in their natural state. Alterations to such drainage courses may be allowed if the application of this Section will result in upstream or downstream flooding hazards for which there is no other feasible means of mitigation consistent with the findings (Section 9-32.050 of this Chapter). 
B.  In the event off-site drainage facilities will be required to handle increased runoff from any development subject to these regulations, interim drainage facilities which provide for no increase in peak runoff from a 10 year storm shall be constructed and maintained until such time as the permanent facilities are completed. 
C.  The overall drainage system shall be completed and made operational at the earliest possible time during construction or shall otherwise be provided for in a manner acceptable to the City. If a development is to be phased, all downstream (including interim facilities within the project area or required interim off-site drainage facilities) elements of the approved drainage facilities will be completed or otherwise provided for in a manner acceptable to the City before the completion of the upstream phases. 
D.  A drainage plan, including the text, maps, and diagrams, shall be submitted to the City as a part of any formal application for development under these regulations. The City Engineer in consultation with the Director, or their designees, shall review such submissions for completeness, adequacy, and conformance with the above and other applicable standards. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.130 - Street Standards 
The design of streets and the circulation pattern within any proposed project governed by the regulations of this Article shall be such as to minimize grading requirements; shall, to the maximum feasible extent, complement the natural contours of the land; shall serve to retain the natural features of the impacted hillsides; shall be designed in such a manner as to reduce street mileage to a minimum; and shall be as narrow as traffic generation and public safety will permit. 
A.  Local street widths. The minimal street width in residential land use zones for local and cul-de-sac streets (those streets used primarily to serve abutting property) shall be 28 feet from curb facing to curb facing with a five foot improved shoulder on each side. 
In order to encourage a rural feeling in residential land use zones of two units per acre or less, reduced street standards, including, but not limited to, reduction in minimum street width as set forth in this Subsection and the elimination of sidewalks and formal parkways will be allowed if the Director, in consultation with the City Engineer; or the Commission; or the Council determines that such will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or that adequate alternative pedestrian circulation has been provided. 
B.  Access roadway length. Where access to isolated land areas with less than 20 percent slope can be provided only by constructing a roadway traversing natural slopes in excess of 20 percent, such a roadway shall not traverse 20 percent slopes for more than a cumulative distance of 100 feet per dwelling unit requiring such access nor more than 200 feet per acre of commercial or industrial land of less than 20 percent slope. 
C.  Special streets. Special streets, such as one-way streets, split level streets, and dead-end streets, shall be acceptable when their use is justified by detailed engineering studies submitted by the applicant, approved by the City Engineer in consultation with the Director, or their designees, and are found to be necessary for the full achievement of the findings of the performance standards (Section 9-32.050 of this Chapter). 
The maximum centerline gradient for residential streets shall be no more than 10 percent, except at intersections or adjacent areas of transition where the gradient should be less than two percent. 
D.  Applicability of the City of Simi Valley Road Standards. In all other respects, any proposed trafficway shall comply with the City of Simi Valley Road Standards. Exceptions to the City of Simi Valley Road Standards may be granted under the performance standards if the City Engineer, in consultation with the Director, or their designees; or the Commission; or the Council determines that the findings (Section 9-32.050 of this Article) of the performance standards serve to be furthered by such an exception. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.140 - Design Standards 
Applicants are encouraged to employ site planning and architectural techniques which implement the findings of the performance standards (Section 9-32.050 of this Chapter). In general, any proposed land use shall be planned and designed in such a fashion as to complement and preserve the hillside terrain as well as provide a safe living environment. 
A.  Buildings. 
1.  Those building styles and lot configurations which lend themselves to hillside development or those which are easily adapted to meet the special design and terrain requirements presented by hillside areas are encouraged. The intent is to encourage building methods as well as other land development methods in 10 percent to 20 percent slope areas which minimize terrain disruption and blend with the natural contours of the subject hillside terrain. The maximum height of any building constructed on land subject to the standards set forth in this Article shall be two stories or 35 feet, whichever is less. 
2.  Buildings and grading should be planned in such a manner as to hide necessary grading under or behind buildings. An example of such a technique would be split level construction. 
B.  Horse keeping. When horse keeping is proposed in areas subject to the provisions of this Chapter, such property should be buffered from non-horse keeping property as much as possible through intervening open space, arterial roads, landscaping, other appropriate design techniques, or lotting patterns which avoid common lot lines between horse keeping and non-horse keeping property. 
C.  Viewshed. Views from land subject to the provisions of the performance standards should be respected through design. 
1.  Living areas of dwelling units should be faced on to open, landscaped, or view areas. 
2.  Dwelling units should be located in such a manner as to avoid interference with the view from other existing or proposed dwelling units. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.150 - Ridge Line Development Standards 
In order to implement the findings of the performance standards set forth in this Article, there shall be no development along visually prominent ridge lines in order to preserve the existing backdrop to the community and to maintain the open character of the visually prominent ridge lines surrounding the City. The purpose of this Section is to set forth standards for maintaining such ridge lines and their immediately adjacent slopes. 
A.  Areas to remain undeveloped. 
1.  Structures subject to the provisions of the performance standards shall not be constructed on top of any visually prominent ridge line as defined in Subsection (1) of Subsection C of this Section. 
2.  No point on any structure subject to the provisions of the performance standards shall be closer to a visually prominent ridge line than 150 feet measured horizontally on a topographic map or 50 feet measured vertically on a cross section, whichever is more restrictive, except that this requirement shall not affect the location of structures to be placed at or below the lowest visible elevation of a visually prominent ridge line. 
B.  Transfer of dwelling units. Allowed dwelling units may be transferred to another place on the subject parcel if such dwelling units could not be constructed due to the provisions of Subsection A of this Section. The place to which the subject dwelling units are transferred shall be buildable under the provisions of the performance standards. 
C.  Definitions. The terms used in this Section shall have the following meanings: 
1.  "Visually prominent ridge line" shall mean any hill location visible from the valley floor and subject to the provisions of the performance standards which location forms a part of the skyline visible from the valley floor or any hill location visible from the valley floor, the ground surface of which is seen as a distinct edge against a backdrop of land at least 300 feet horizontally behind it. 
2.  "Visible from viewpoints from the valley floor" shall mean continuously visible for more than 1,000 feet along any of the following: 
a.  The Simi Valley freeway between Kuehner Drive and Oak Park; 
b.  Madera Road between the Simi Valley freeway and the East Valley Sheriff's Station; 
c.  Tierra Rejada Road between the western City limit and Los Angeles Avenue; or

D.  Maps on file. A map shall be kept on file with the Department of Environmental Services outlining visually prominent ridge lines to be used as a guide in complying with the provisions of this Section. If there should be a conflict between the written provisions of this Section or a detailed site analysis and the map, the written provisions shall control. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.160 - Landscaping Standards 
All hillside property subject to the performance standards set forth in this Article shall be landscaped in such a manner as to reduce fire hazards, stabilize cut/fill slopes, reduce erosion, retain moisture, and enhance the natural scenic beauty of the valley. 
A.  Retention of vegetation. Wherever possible, well adapted drought resistant natural flora shall be retained. 
B.  Major tree planting. The planting of major trees in areas to remain in natural open space should include, but not be limited to, the following native species: 
1.  Juglans California hindsi (California Black Walnut); 
2.  Platanus racemosa (California Sycamore); 
3.  Quercus agrifolia (California Live Oak); and 
4.  Quercus lobata (Valley Oak). 
C.  Landscaping in developed areas. Landscaping in developed areas, such as in parkways or in group recreation areas, should be integrated with other elements of the proposal and comply with other guidelines for the preservation of natural topographic features, the view of ridge lines, and the preservation of vistas. 
D.  Preliminary landscape plans. A preliminary or conceptual landscaping plan prepared by a registered landscape architect and acceptable to the Director shall be submitted at the time of an application. Such a plan shall outline all proposed planting in graded and non-graded areas, the means of irrigation, the proposed timing of the landscape installation, and the manner in which landscaping will be maintained. A precise landscape plan shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a grading permit. 
E.  Landscape maintenance. Plans and proposed programs for the ongoing maintenance of landscaped areas shall be submitted at the time of an application. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to, the responsible parties or agencies, the nature and extent of each agency's and party's responsibility, and the financial arrangements for maintenance. The Director, or his designee, shall review such plans for completeness, adequacy, and conformance with applicable standards. The Director, or his designee, may waive such submissions in the event a determination is made that such submissions are not required due to the scope or scale of the subject application. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-32.170 - Utilities and Sewer Facilities 
A.  All public or private utilities and facilities proposed in areas subject to this Article shall be planned and constructed consistently with the appropriate provisions of this Article. The Commission or the Council shall review and comment on any such proposals prior to construction.

E.  Mixed use projects. When mixed commercial and residential land uses are allowed on one site, commercial space allocation shall apply to commercial portions of the site, and residential criteria shall apply to the residential portions of the site. When residential and commercial uses are combined in the same structure, residential space allocation requirements shall be applied.

Chapter 9-37 - Signs 
 
9-37.010 - Findings and Intent of Chapter 
Regulations established by this Chapter are intended to appropriately regulate the placement, type, size, and number of signs allowed within the City, and to require the proper maintenance of signs in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. In order to further these purposes, the City finds and determines that these regulations are necessary in order to: 
A.  Avoid traffic hazards to motorists and pedestrians caused by visual distractions and obstructions by insuring that official traffic regulation devices can be easily seen, that adequate sight distance is maintained, and that visual impacts are limited to reduce hazards, by prohibiting nearby visual obstructions such as moving, rotating or blinking signs, an excessive number of signs, an excessive amount of copy-on signs or signs resembling official signs, and by prohibiting signs in the public right-of-way; 
B.  Promote the aesthetic and environmental values of the community by providing for signs that do not impair the attractiveness of the City, prohibiting the visual clutter of obtrusive signs, and prohibiting signs in the public right-of-way; 
C.  Provide for signs as an effective channel of communications, while ensuring that signs are aesthetically proportioned in relation to adjacent structures and the structures to which they are attached; 
D.  Regulate commercial signage based upon the City's determination that such signage constitutes the majority of existing signs and that the City desires to regulate and allow such signage in such a manner that allows for reasonable and equitable identification of businesses and properties, while providing a channel of communication to advertise businesses in the commercial and industrial zones of the City, and maintaining the residential character of the City's residential zones; 
E.  Regulate based upon the City's compelling interest in maintaining the residential character of such zones, in order to provide that a residential use with a home occupation shall be considered a residential use and no commercial signs, other than commercial signs placed by charitable organizations, may be displayed; 
F.  Regulate based upon the City's compelling interest in ensuring traffic safety, in order to provide that ancillary signs are permitted in order to directly advance that interest, subject to the maximum number set forth in this Development Code; and 
G.  Prohibit the placement of signs in the public right-of-way based upon the following: 
Prior to the adoption of the ordinance, the City of Simi Valley has permitted temporary signs in the public right-of-way, which has resulted in substantial unsightly conditions, as illustrated in evidence presented to the City Council during its consideration of this ordinance. 
The placement and accumulation of temporary signs in the public right-of-way, on traffic and utility devices, upon public sidewalks or on public easements presents dangerous conditions to the free and safe flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Such areas must be preserved for official traffic signs and official utility notices in order to assure the safe flow of traffic. 
In addition, in upholding prohibitions against the posting of signs on sidewalks, utility poles and other public property, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) , said that "The problem addressed by this ordinance - the visual assault on the citizens of Los Angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public property - constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to prohibit. "[T]he City's interest in attempting to preserve [or improve] the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect." Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S., at 71. " The Vincent Court also observed that temporary signs could still be allowed on private property, noting that, "Moreover, by not extending the ban to all locations, a significant opportunity to communicate by means of temporary signs is preserved, and private property owners' esthetic concerns will keep the posting of signs on their property within reasonable bounds. Even if some visual blight remains, a partial, content-neutral ban may nevertheless enhance the City's appearance." 
H.  Regulate signs for charitable organizations by permitting them to be located on private property and for a sufficient duration, in order to promote charitable events and activities based upon the City's substantial interest in supporting such events and activities because of the community services they support and based upon the following: 
The temporary sign ordinance, which prohibits signs on public property and in the public right-of-way, and otherwise limits the number and duration of temporary commercial signs on private property, directly advances the City's substantial governmental interests and concerns regarding aesthetics by reducing the visual blight created by the proliferation of temporary commercial signs without burdening an excessive amount of speech. 
The sign ordinance is narrowly tailored because it does not over-regulate protected speech. It restricts the duration, size, and location of temporary commercial signs, other than signs placed by charitable organizations. Also, with the limited exception of charitable commercial signs, the ordinance prohibits commercial signs in residential zones, in order to advance the City's compelling interest in maintaining the residential character of such zones. Commercial enterprises still have the ability to advertise, contact and communicate with consumers in other ways; such as direct mail, newspaper, radio, television and on-site advertising. 
The general principle that the First Amendment forbids the government from regulating speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others is not applicable here because the City's regulations are neutral or even silent concerning any speaker's point of view. Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent (1984) 466 U.S. 787. 
Content-based regulations which disadvantage commercial speech are subject to a lesser degree of First Amendment protection as provided in the U.S. Supreme Court case Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of N.Y. 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980). 
Central Hudson established a three-part test for First Amendment challenges to regulations restricting nonmisleading commercial speech that relates to lawful activity. First, the government must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by the regulation. Second, the regulation must directly advance that governmental interest. Third, although the regulation need not be the least restrictive measure available, it must be narrowly tailored so as not to restrict more speech than necessary. Together, these final two factors require that there be a reasonable fit between the government's objectives and the means it chooses to accomplish those ends. 
The government bears the burden of asserting one or more substantial governmental interests and demonstrating a reasonable fit between those interests and the challenged regulation. The government is not limited in the evidence it may use to meet its burden. 
Unlike the ban in City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410 (1993), which only applied to 62 of the 1,500 to 2,000 news racks in the City, addressing only a "minute" and "paltry" share of the problem, the City of Simi Valley's limitation of allowing one temporary onsite commercial sign, by permit for four 30 day periods per year, applies to all of the approximately 7,500 businesses in Simi Valley which have obtained business licenses and will substantially reduce the number of temporary commercial signs from what has previously been allowed in the City. Charitable signs, without such numerical or permit requirements, may also be placed on private property with permission of the property owner, however, based upon historical experience in the City, the number of charitable organizations and events, and thus the potential for placement of their signs, are limited in number. Moreover, eliminating commercial signs from residential neighborhoods, except for charitable commercial signs, will substantially advance the City's interests in aesthetics and maintaining the residential character of residential neighborhoods. In addition the City is going no further than necessary to achieve its regulatory objective in that the distinctions between commercial signs has been structured to be based upon broad categories (i.e., signs placed by charitable organizations promoting charitable events and activities) as opposed to the specific content or point of view of the organization or enterprise. 
The government may be said to advance its purpose by substantially reducing sign proliferation, even where it is not totally eradicated. Evidence presented to the City Council during its consideration of the adoption of this ordinance provided examples of sign proliferation in the City. A limitation on temporary sign display is directly related to the objective of aesthetics. The Simi Valley City Council desires to allow a greater number of temporary charitable commercial signs because of their unique value to the community. 
The City has a substantial governmental interest in permitting nonprofit organizations that are raising funds for charitable events that support social services in the community to have their signs in place for an amount of time sufficient to promote their event. This is necessary because most of these charitable organizations, unlike most commercial businesses, have no fixed location where they can place signs upon their property advertising their events, thus furthering the necessity for signage display. 
The temporary sign ordinance does not hinder any business's ability to advertise its business by other means such as additional window signs, newspaper, direct mail or other forms of advertising, in addition to permitted onsite temporary signs. There is a distinction drawn in the ordinance between the signs of sellers of goods or services and those placed by charitable organizations. 
The United States Supreme Court held that "because charitable solicitation does more than inform private economic decisions and is not primarily concerned with providing information about the characteristics and costs of goods and services, it has not been dealt with as a variety of purely commercial speech." Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment 444 U.S. 620, 632 (1980) . See also Mainstream Marketing Services v. Federal Trade Commission [10th Circuit (2004)] . 
Therefore, the City of Simi Valley has established a reasonable fit between the substantial interests which it advances and the regulation of the signs.

1.  Responsibility for design and construction. 
a.  Design drawings for proposed permanent signs should be prepared by design professionals (e.g., graphic designers, architects, landscape architects, interior designers, whose principal business is the design, manufacture, or sale of signs) or others who are determined by the Director to be capable of producing professional results. 
b.  All permanent signs should be constructed by individuals whose principal business is building construction or a related trade, including those whose principal business is the manufacture and installation of signs, or others capable of producing professional results. The intent is to achieve signing of careful construction, neat and readable copy, and durability, to reduce maintenance costs and to prevent dilapidation. 
2.  Sign copy. The City does not regulate the message content (copy) of signs; however, the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs. Copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged. 
a.  Sign copy should relate only to the name and/or nature of the business or commercial center. 
b.  Permanent signs that advertise continuous sales, special prices, etc. should be avoided. 
c.  Information should be conveyed briefly or by logo, symbol, or other graphic manner. The intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business. 
d.  Freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multi-tenant center. 
3.  Colors. Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious (e.g., compatible and complementary) with one another and representative of the dominant colors of the building(s) being identified. 
4.  Materials and structure. 
a.  Materials selected for permanent signs should be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance. 
b.  Sign materials (including those for framing and support) should be similar in appearance to the type and scale of materials used on the buildings on the same site as the sign. Insofar as possible, sign materials should match the materials used on the building and on other signs on the project site. 
c.  The size of the structural members (e.g., supports) should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports. 
d.  Any background required to support the individual letters should be the same (e.g., color, materials, etc.) for all on-site signs with backgrounds. 
e.  The use of signs composed of individual letters mounted on a building wall and incorporated into the building design (rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall) should be required under the following: 
(1)  Proposed signs under a Master Sign Program; 
(2)  New or modified signs; and 
(3)  Any background required to support the individual letters should be the minimum amount needed to serve the intended purpose. 
5.  Light sources. Light sources should utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible. 
6.  Sign illumination. 
a.  External light sources should be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of any object other than the sign. 
b.  In areas with low ambient nighttime illumination levels (e.g., residential neighborhoods or business districts with little or no illuminated signing) applicants are encouraged to use light, illuminated copy against dark or opaque backgrounds. 
c.  Reflective-type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed 15 watts should not be used on the exterior surface of signs so as to expose the face of the bulb or lamp to a public right-of-way or adjacent property. 
G.  Electronic changeable copy sign standards. 
1.  The display illumination shall not have continuous motion or appear to be in continuous motion. 
2.  The message rate shall not change at a rate faster than one message every 30 seconds. 
3.  The intensity of the illumination shall neither change nor flash. 
4.  For signs located within or abutting residential zones, the hours of operation are limited to 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 
5.  The display is limited to text only and no graphics/pictures are allowed. 
6.  The sign shall be freestanding only with a maximum height of eight feet and a total area allowed for electronic display limited to 40 square feet.

9-38.050 - Guidelines for Trees Associated with Urban Development 
A.  Desirability of preserving protected trees. Initial project layout, design, and grading shall recognize the desirability of preserving protected trees with appropriate modifications and adjustments to accommodate preservation and maintenance by locating the best candidates in areas where preservation is feasible. 
B.  Appropriate safeguard considerations. Design of the grading and other improvements shall reflect consideration of the following safeguards: 
1.  Location in minimum growing areas as required by individual species; 
2.  No disruption or removal of structural or feeder roots; 
3.  Fencing of trees at or beyond their drip lines during grading and construction activities; 
4.  No filling, cutting, development, or compaction of soils within the drip line; and 
5.  Other measures required by the species of tree to be preserved as recommended by the consulting arborist, horticulturist or landscape architect. 
C.  Practicality of preserving all healthy trees. 
1.  It is recognized that the complete preservation of healthy trees may sometimes conflict with normal land developmental considerations (e.g., proper circulation, drainage, grading, safety and provisions of utilities). 
2.  Within a given development, it may not be practical to preserve all healthy trees and therefore the City and the developer shall be willing to compromise the goal of complete tree preservation in order to address other public safety and design concerns. 
3.  In these instances, the design of the development shall address preservation of the most desirable and significant of the healthy trees and the developer shall utilize creative land planning techniques to achieve this end. 
D.  Proposed preservation plan. 
1.  The Commission, when reviewing development plans, shall determine the adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed preservation plan. 
2.  When conditioning a project to relocate a tree, the Commission shall consider the technical feasibility of relocation, the cost of relocation versus the appraised value of the tree, and the proposed new location of the tree. 
a.  If a tree is to be relocated to public property, the applicant shall submit to the City a written commitment to accept and maintain the tree from the public agency which will receive the tree. 
b.  The public agency shall have the option of refusing acceptance of the tree. 
c.  Trees shall be relocated by arborists with experience in moving mature trees. 
3.  Following approval of a development, the developer shall submit grading and precise landscaping plans detailing the approved preservation plan. 
4.  The locations of all protected trees shall be indicated on these plans by the number of the tree as described in the tree study, with details indicating which trees shall be preserved or relocated, and which shall be removed. 
5.  The plans shall be approved by the Director and the City Engineer. 
6.  Before use inauguration, the preserved trees shall be trimmed for balance, structural integrity, and ornamental appearance as recommended in the tree report for the project, subject to the satisfaction of the Director. 
E.  Preservation of Blue Gum trees. Preservation of Blue Gum trees (Eucalyptus globulus) is not required within parkways, medians, or planter areas of less than 12 feet in width, exclusive of sidewalks, adjacent to structures, or within parcels with single-family detached residences, closer than 75 feet from the nearest structure intended for human habitation. 
F.  Precise vertical and horizontal locations. The precise vertical and horizontal locations, plus or minus one foot, of all protected trees shall be shown on the site plan as part of the initial application for any development project, unless that project would involve no exterior construction activities. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-40.050 - Site Development and Operating Guidelines 
The following general guidelines shall be used in the development of conditions to help ensure that an oil development project generates minimal negative impacts on the environment. Each guideline shall be applied whenever physically and economically feasible and practicable, unless the strict application of a particular guideline would otherwise defeat the intent of other guidelines. An applicant should use the guidelines in the design of the project and anticipate their use as permit conditions, unless the applicant can demonstrate that they are not feasible or practicable. 
A.  Permit areas and drill sites should generally coincide and should only be as large as necessary to accommodate typical drilling and production equipment. 
B.  The number of drill sites in an area should be minimized by using centralized drill sites, directional drilling and other techniques. 
C.  Drill sites and production facilities should be located so that they are not readily seen. 
D.  Permittees and operators should share facilities such as, but not limited to, permit areas, drill sites, access roads, storage, production, and processing facilities and pipelines. 
E.  Pipelines should be used to transport petroleum products off-site to promote traffic safety and air quality. 
F.  Cuts or fills associated with access roads and drill sites within the limits of the City's Hillside Performance Standards, should be kept to a minimum to avoid erosion and visual impacts. They should be located in inconspicuous areas, and generally not exceed 10 vertical feet. Cuts or fills shall be restored to their original grade once the use has been discontinued for more than 60 continuous calendar days. 
G.  Gas from wells shall be piped to centralized collection and processing facilities, rather than being flared, to preserve energy resources and air quality and reduce fire hazards and light sources. 
H.  Each well shall be located a minimum of 800 feet from occupied sensitive uses. Private access roads to drill sites shall be located a minimum of 500 feet from occupied sensitive uses. [Sensitive uses are defined in Section 9-40.070(A) (Noise Mitigation).] 
I.  Oversized vehicles shall be preceded by lead vehicles, where necessary for traffic safety. 
J.  Lighting shall be kept to a minimum to approximate normal nighttime light levels as approved by the Director. 
K.  In general, projects shall be located, designed and operated so as to minimize their adverse impact on the physical and social environment. To this end, dust, noise, vibration, noxious odors, intrusive light, aesthetic impacts, and other factors of nuisance and annoyance shall be reduced to a minimum or eliminated through the best accepted practices incident to the exploration and production of oil and gas. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-40.060 - Site Development and Operating Standards 
The following minimum standards and requirements shall apply to all petroleum operations, provided that more restrictive requirements may be imposed on a project through the conditions of permit approval. 
A.  Setback requirements. No well shall be drilled and no equipment or facilities shall be permanently located within: 
1.  100 feet of any dedicated public street, highway or nearest rail of an active railway, unless the new well is located on an existing drill site and the new well would not present a safety or right-of-way problem. If the review authority determines that aesthetics is a problem, the permit shall be conditioned to mitigate the problem. 
2.  800 feet of any building or dwelling not necessary to the operation of the well. In no case shall the well be located less than 100 feet from each structure. 
3.  800 feet of any institution, school or other building used as a place of public assembly. In no case shall any well be located less than 300 feet from each structure. 
4.  300 feet from the edge of the existing banks of any channel as established by the Ventura County Watershed Protection District (VCWPD) and 100 feet from the existing banks of all other channels appearing on the most current United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 2,000' scale topographic map as a blue line. These setbacks shall prevail unless the permittee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department that the subject use can be safely located nearer the stream or channel in question without posing an undue risk of water pollution, damage to wildlife and habitat, and impairment of flood control interests. In no case shall setbacks from streams or channels be less than 50 feet. All drill sites located within the 100-year flood plain shall be protected from flooding in compliance with Ventura County Watershed Protection District requirements. 
5.  The applicable setbacks for accessory structures for the zone in which the use is located. 
6.  100 feet from any spring appearing on the most current USGS 2,000' scale topographic map.

C.  Containment of contaminants. Oil, produced water, drilling fluids, cuttings, and other contaminants associated with the drilling, production, storage and transport of oil shall be contained on the site unless properly transported off-site or injected into a well. The permittee shall furnish the Director with a plan for controlling oil spillage and preventing saline or other polluting or contaminating substances from reaching surface or subsurface waters. The plan shall be consistent with the requirements of the City, County, State and Federal Governments. 
D.  Dust prevention. The drill site and all roads or hauling routes located between the public right-of-way and the subject site shall be improved or otherwise treated as required by the City and maintained as necessary to prevent the emanation of dust. 
E.  Light emanation. Light emanation shall be controlled so as not to produce excessive levels of glare or abnormal light levels directed at any neighboring uses. 
F.  Painting. Each permanent facility, structure, and aboveground pipeline on the site shall be colored to mask it from the surrounding environment and uses in the area. The selected colors shall also take into account factors including heat buildup and the designation of dangerous areas. The colors shall be approved by the Director prior to the painting of facilities. 
G.  Site maintenance. The permit area shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner so as not to create any hazardous or unsightly conditions such as debris; pools of oil, water, or other liquids; weeds; brush; and trash. Equipment and materials that are appurtenant to the operation and maintenance of the oil well on the site may be stored on the site. If the well has been suspended, idled or shut-in for 30 days, as determined by the City, all such equipment and materials shall be removed within 90 days. 
H.  Removal of equipment. All equipment used for drilling, redrilling, and maintenance work on approved wells shall be removed from the site within 30 calendar days of the completion of such work unless a time extension is approved by the Director. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)

Each drilling operation and well site shall comply with the following standards for noise mitigation. 
A.  Maximum noise levels. Unless exempted by this Subsection, drilling, production, and maintenance operations associated with an approved oil permit shall not produce noise, measured at a point anywhere on a lot containing occupied sensitive uses such as residences, schools, health care facilities, or places of public assembly, that exceeds the standards in Table 4-1, or any other more restrictive standard that may be established as a condition of a specific permit. 
1.  Noise from the site shall be considered in excess of the standard when the average sound level, measured over one hour, is greater than the standard that follows. The determination of whether a violation has occurred shall be made in compliance with the provisions of the permit in question. 
2.  Nomenclature and noise level descriptor definitions are in compliance with ANSI Sec. 3.33-1980, "Second Level Descriptors for Determination of Compatible Land Use." Measurement procedures shall comply with the adopted "Noise Measurement Guidelines and Procedures." 
TABLE 4-1 - MAXIMUM NOISE LEVELS 
Time Period 	Average Noise Levels (L eq ) 
	Drilling and Maintenance Phase 	Producing Phase (1) 
Day (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) 	55 dBA 	45 dBA 
Night (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) 	45 dBA 	40 dBA 
 
Notes: 
(1) For purposes of this Section, a well is in the "producing phase" when hydrocarbons are being extracted or when the well is idled and not undergoing maintenance. It is presumed that a well is in the "drilling and maintenance phase" when not in the "producing phase." 
B.  Exceptions from noise standards. The noise standards in Table 4-1 shall not be exceeded unless the ambient noise levels exceed the applicable noise standards. In such cases, the maximum allowable noise levels shall not exceed the ambient noise levels. 
C.  Compliance with noise standards. When a permittee has been notified by the Department of Environmental Services that the operation is in violation of the applicable noise standard, the permittee shall correct the problem as soon as possible in coordination with the Department of Environmental Services. In the interim, operations may continue as stated below; however, the operator shall attempt to minimize the total noise generated at the site by limiting, whenever possible, activities including the following: 
1.  Hammering on pipe; 
2.  Racking or making-up of pipe; 
3.  Acceleration and deceleration of engines or motors; 
4.  Drilling assembly rotational speeds that cause more noise than necessary and could reasonably be reduced by use of a slower rotational speed; 
5.  Picking up or laying down drill pipe, casing, tubing or rods into or out of the drill hole. 
If the noise problem has not been corrected by 7:00 p.m. of the following day, the offending operations, except for those deemed necessary for safety reasons, shall be suspended by the Deputy Director/City Planner until the problem is corrected. 
D.  Preventive noise insulation. If drilling, redrilling, or maintenance operations, including as pulling pipe or pumps, are located within 1,600 feet of an occupied sensitive use, the work platform, engine base and draw works, crown block, power source, pipe rack and other probable noise sources associated with a drilling or maintenance operation shall be enclosed with soundproofing sufficient to ensure that expected noise levels do not exceed the noise limits applicable to the permit. Such soundproofing shall be installed prior to the commencement of drilling or maintenance activities. These requirements may be waived if the Director is satisfied that the applicable noise standard can be met. 
E.  Hours of well maintenance. All nonemergency maintenance of a well, such as the pulling of pipe and replacement of pumps, shall be limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. of the same day if the well site is located within 3,000 feet of an occupied residence. This requirement may be waived if the Director is satisfied that the applicable noise standard can be met. 
F.  Limited drilling hours. All drilling activities shall be limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. of the same day when they occur less than 800 feet from an occupied sensitive use. Nighttime drilling shall be permitted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the applicable noise standard can be met.

c.  Allow a reduction of a maximum of two of the optional residential development standards required per Section 9-24.060.D for all types of residential projects in a mixed-use project. 
I.  Mixed-Use Overlay District Design Guidelines. The following design guidelines are strongly encouraged for use in the design of mixed-use development applications. Note that all design guidelines appear in italics to distinguish them from standards, which are mandatory requirements. 
1.  Site design guidelines. The following guidelines should be incorporated into the site planning for a mixed-use development. 
a.  Site design should relate to surrounding properties with respect to building locations, orientation, massing, setbacks, and the arrangement of driveways, pedestrian pathways, parking, and open space. 
b.  The location of structures and site improvements should create a pedestrian-oriented environment. Pedestrian pathways should be provided throughout mixed-use projects and should connect to on-site uses, parking areas, adjacent uses, and to existing and future transit stops within or adjacent to the project site. 
c.  Developments should be designed to minimize motor vehicle circulation through local single-family neighborhood streets. 
d.  Where feasible, traffic calming features should be used to encourage the pedestrian-oriented nature of a mixed-use development. Examples of appropriate traffic calming measures include: lighted and clearly marked crosswalks; horizontal deflections such as landscaped center islands, street bulb-outs, road narrowing, chicanes and roundabouts; vertical deflections such as raised and textured intersections and crosswalks; and street trees and parkway planters that provide visual interest and buffer pedestrians from motor vehicles on public streets. 
e.  Mixed-use projects should include clear and well-designed entries into the project. Such entries should incorporate the use of walls, signage, landscaping, and decorative paving to visually link the site entry to the buildings. 
f.  A decorative treatment (i.e., special paving) should be used to delineate pedestrian pathways and crossings at circulation drives and within parking areas. 
g.  Public open space designed as gathering areas (courtyards, plazas, etc.) should include amenities such as fountains, seating, enhanced landscaping, decorative pavement, etc. 
2.  Architecture. The following guidelines should be incorporated into the design of all buildings within a mixed-use development. 
a.  The corners of buildings at intersections should receive special architectural treatment, including but not limited to towers, arcades, unique color, materials and window treatments, etc. 
b.  To encourage pedestrian activity, a minimum of 60% of the building frontage facing a street or pedestrian way should incorporate pedestrian-oriented features (i.e., pedestrian entrances, display windows, etc.). 
c.  All buildings within a mixed-use development should be designed to a human scale and be connected by a uniform architectural theme. 
d.  The architectural style and use of materials should be consistent throughout the entire mixed-use project. Differences in materials and/or architectural details should only occur on a structure where the intent is to differentiate between the residential scale and character of the structure and the commercial scale and character. 
e.  Building wall planes should be vertically and horizontally offset or otherwise articulated every 10 feet on all sides. To articulate the wall planes, facades should incorporate arcades, colonnades, recessed entrances, window details, bays, variation in building materials, balconies, porches, vines on trellises, roofline trim detail, etc. The wall offsets should vary in depth of the building wall by a minimum of four feet or a series of offsets, projections or recesses, including balconies, that vary the depth of the building wall by a minimum of four feet. 
f.  Window placement for street level businesses should be located along public street frontages at a height that pedestrians can easily look into and see the business activities, products, etc. 
g.  Upper floors should incorporate windows, bays, and balconies that overlook the street wherever feasible. 
h.  Windows of residential units should be offset when facing other residential units and should face away from loading areas, docks, and trash enclosures when feasible. 
i.  Building entries with high activity levels should be illuminated. Appropriate treatments include: bathing entry surfaces with light; allowing the building interior light glow through glazing; or using decorative lighting fixtures to announce entries. 
j.  Projects three stories or less in height should incorporate full roofs on at least 50% of the roof area. 
k.  At a minimum, the roofline at the top of the structure should not run in a continuous plane for more than 50 feet without offsetting or jogging the roof plane and/or incorporating design features such as gables, decorative cornices, etc. Roof materials should be appropriate to the style of the building, roof slope and form. Corrugated metal, composition shingles, illuminated roofing, and highly reflective surfaces that create glare are not allowed. 
l.  All roof-mounted equipment shall be screened. Special consideration should be given to the location and screening of noise generating equipment such as refrigeration units, air conditioning, and exhaust fans. Noise reducing screens and insulation may be required where such equipment has the potential to impact residential uses. 
3.  Accessory Structures. Accessory structures, such as bus shelters, kiosks, gazebos, etc., should be architecturally compatible with the principal structure on the site through the use of consistent architecture, colors and materials, and landscaping. 
4.  L andscaping. The following guidelines should be incorporated into the design of the overall landscape plan for a mixed-use development. 
a.  One species of street tree should be used for the sidewalk planting area with an additional type for any on-street parking and median plantings. 
b.  Vines and climbing plants should be used to break up large expanses of blank building walls, and on garden walls, refuse enclosures, etc., to enhance the aesthetic value of the project and to deter graffiti. 
c.  Regular up-lighting of walls and focal landscape features, such as specimen trees, should occur throughout the project site to create a consistent and dramatic effect. 
5.  Parking. The following guidelines should be considered when designing the parking areas (open and/or structured parking areas) for a mixed-use development. 
a.  Where feasible, parking structures should be constructed rather than open parking lots. 
b.  Parking structures should be architecturally integrated with the project design. 
c.  Parking aisles should be separated from pedestrian access routes whenever possible. 
d.  Parking areas should be located and designed to be convenient for all visitors and users of the mixed-use development, in order to minimize parking in adjacent neighborhoods. 
e.  Open parking areas shall be screened from the street by a 30-inch high wall, fence, berm, or landscaping that is measured above the highest adjacent grade. 
f.  In parking lots for mixed-use developments containing over 100 parking stalls, pedestrian walkways that are separated from vehicular traffic shall be provided through parking areas, to provide safe access for pedestrians through the site. 
6.  Refuse and Recyclable Container Enclosures. Loading areas and trash enclosures should be located and designed for convenient access by service vehicles and by tenants and residents of the project. 
7.  Pedestrian Access. Primary building entries and courtyards abutting a street shall be directly accessed from the street to facilitate pedestrian access and movement between adjacent uses. Where primary building entries do not abut a street, connecting walkways shall link the building entrance to street sidewalks. Connecting walkways must have a minimum six-foot clear paved width and any covered structure, such as a trellis, must have at least 10 feet clear height.

A.  Preapplication review. 
1.  A prospective applicant or agent is strongly encouraged to request a preapplication review with the Department before completion of project design and the formal submittal of a permit application. 
2.  A request by an applicant for preapplication review, accompanied by preliminary project plans and designs and the required filing fee, will be reviewed by affected City departments and other selected agencies. 
3.  The reviewing City staff members will identify specific requirements as they apply to the proposed development project, provide a preliminary list of issues that will likely be of concern during formal application review (e.g., degree of compliance with the General Plan and this Development Code), suggest possible alternatives or modifications to the project, identify additional required information, and indicate probable environmental reporting requirements under CEQA. 
4.  When the preapplication review is completed, the City staff will send the applicant a written report which will include a specific evaluation of the proposed project, primarily focusing on the issues identified in Subsection (A)(3), above. 
5.  Neither the preapplication review nor information or pertinent policies provided by the Department shall be construed as a Department recommendation for approval or disapproval of the application or project. 
B.  Application, contents and fee. 
1.  Applications shall be filed with the Department. 
2.  An application shall not be accepted for filing and processing unless it conforms to the requirements of this Development Code and the information required by the Department for the specific type of application (e.g., Conditional Use Permit, Planned Development Permit, Variance, etc.), contained in a complete and accurate form the required materials and information prescribed by the forms supplied by the Department, and is accompanied by the appropriate fee(s) required by the City's Schedule of Service Charges. 
3.  The content of applications shall be determined by the Department and as identified in Chapter 9-52 (Permit Review, and Approval or Disapproval). Site plans and elevations in color, floor plans, and samples of exterior building finishing materials may be required as part of the permit application.

In the event of conflict between the specifications, the City Engineer's decision shall be final as to which improvement standard is applicable. 
C.  Subdivision improvement standards - Conditions of approval. The improvement and dedication requirements of this Article and any other improvements and dedications required by the review authority in compliance with Section 9-61.050 (Tentative Map Public Hearing and Action), shall be described in conditions of approval adopted for each approved Tentative Map (Section 9-61.070). The design, construction or installation of all subdivision improvements shall comply with Subsection B. 
D.  Conflicting provisions. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Article and other provisions of this Development Code, or other provisions of the Municipal Code, the most restrictive provisions shall control. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Article and the Map Act, the Map Act shall control. 
E.  Supplemental capacity. The City may require that improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision shall contain supplemental sizes, capacity, or number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision and that the improvements be dedicated to the City. 
1.  Public hearing and findings. The Council shall hold a public hearing in compliance with Map Act Section 66451.3 before establishing any charge, area of benefit, or local benefit district. Before the establishment of a charge, area of benefit, or local benefit district, the Council shall find that the fee or charge and the area of benefit or local district is reasonably related to the cost of the supplemental improvement and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof. 
2.  Notice of hearing. In addition to the notice required by Map Act Section 66451.3, written notice of the hearing shall be given to the subdivider and to those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the latest equalized assessment role, and the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they can be ascertained at the time. The notices shall be mailed at least 10 days before the date established for hearing. 
3.  Reimbursement of subdivider. Pursuant to the adopted Master Plan of Drainage, the Sewer Master Plan Update, and the City and County Traffic Impact Fee programs, the City may impose a reasonable charge on property within the area benefited and may provide for the collection of the charges as identified in Map Act Sections 66483, 66483.1, 66483.2 and 66484. Alternatively, the conditions of approval of a project may require supplemental facilities, or the construction of intersections or thoroughfares, in excess of the construction required for the project, and authorize a reimbursement agreement in compliance with Map Act Section 66486 whereby subsequent development benefiting from such facilities shall provide reimbursement.

A.  Access and rights-of-way. 
1.  Each parcel shall have direct access to a public street, except where private street, common driveway or other access easement rights are specifically approved by the Director and the City Engineer and made a matter of record in the Ventura County Recorders office. The access easement shall be reserved on the map in perpetuity for the benefit of the affected parcels. 
2.  The street layout of a proposed subdivision shall be consistent with all street right-of-way designations shown on the Circulation Element of the General Plan or any applicable specific plan at the time the Tentative Map is approved. For alignments not shown on the Circulation Element of the General Plan, the City Engineer shall approve alignments that are consistent with the General Plan or any applicable specific plan. 
B.  Drainage and drainage easements. 
1.  The design of a proposed subdivision shall provide for the proper drainage of the proposed subdivision, including all parcels and improvements, based on the runoff that can be anticipated from ultimate development of the watershed area in which the subdivision is located. Stormwater detention measures shall be provided to limit project runoff to a 10-year-developed storm event, and additional detention shall be provided to the extent possible when required by the City Engineer to reduce any adverse effects of runoff on downstream properties, whether due to quantity, frequency, or lack of downstream capacity. 
2.  The design shall ensure that there are no undrained depressions. Rights-of-way shall be provided within the proposed subdivision to provide for flood control channels and conduits, or laterals thereto, which may be constructed within or abutting the proposed subdivision and which are included in the Comprehensive Plan of Flood Control Channels approved by the Board of Supervisors of the Ventura County Watershed Protection District and the Simi Valley Master Plan of Drainage. Access to open channels included in the Comprehensive Plan of Flood Control Channels shall be provided along the entire length of the channel. Access to public underground drainage conduits shall be provided by an easement of not less than 15 feet in width centered directly above the entire length of the conduit. 
3.  The proposed subdivision shall be designed to protect the parcels and improvements, both within the subdivision and of abutting properties, from offsite drainage or flood damage. Offsite storm drain improvements may be required to satisfy this requirement. The design shall also ensure that all public facilities (e.g., sewer, gas, electric and water systems) are located, elevated, and constructed so as to minimize or eliminate flood damage. Further, the design shall provide that any concentrations or increases of surface water received by or resulting from the development of the proposed subdivision are conveyed by means of adequate facilities to a suitable natural watercourse in the area or other drainage facility approved by the City Engineer. Offsite rights-of-way as may be necessary for the facilities shall be provided by the subdivider subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. All rights-of-way required to be provided in compliance with this Section shall be offered for dedication at the time the Parcel Map or Final Map is filed for approval. 
4.  All subdivisions shall comply with the City's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance SVMC Section 7-5.101 et seq., and if applicable, pertinent FEMA regulations. All subdivisions shall provide for construction of drainage facility in compliance with the City's Master Plan of Drainage. At the City Engineer's discretion, pro-rata share payment, based upon developable project area within a drainage area or other applicable formula as determined by the City Engineer, to equitably distribute costs within a watershed, may be allowed in lieu of construction of Master Plan of Drainage facilities. 
C.  Grading and erosion control. Every map which proposes grading shall comply with the requirements in this Article and with the Grading Ordinance (California Building Code Appendix Chapter 33, SVMC Section 8-4.01 et seq.) and the Stormwater Quality Management Program, SVMC Section 6-12.101 et seq., for grading and erosion control, including the prevention of sedimentation or damage to offsite property. 
D.  Parcel requirements. Each parcel in a proposed subdivision shall comply with all applicable requirements of this Development Code before the application is deemed complete, unless a Variance is being requested as part of the application. 
E.  Sanitary sewer service. Whenever a proposed subdivision is located within reasonable proximity to a public sewer service area, the public sewer shall be extended by the subdivider to provide sewer service for the proposed subdivision. Upon application of the subdivider, with concurrence of the State and County health agencies, the Commission may waive the requirements of this Section for good cause shown at the time the Tentative Map is submitted for approval. 
F.  Street lighting. Before approval of a Parcel Map or Final Map, the subdivider shall cause the area within the subdivision to be annexed into the Simi Valley Lighting Maintenance District, which is the district providing street lighting. The Advisory Agency may waive this requirement for Parcel Maps if it finds that inclusion within a service area is unnecessary because of the size or location of the proposed parcels or that inclusion could be more appropriately a condition of approval of a future development. 
G.  Utility easements. Whenever possible, utilities in a proposed subdivision required pursuant to this Article, shall be placed in easements of sufficient width located along parcel lines. 
H.  Water service. Whenever a proposed subdivision is located within the jurisdiction of a public water agency willing and able to provide water service to the parcels, that public water agency shall be chosen as the water purveyor for the proposed subdivision. Where an adjoining water agency can better provide the services, is willing to provide the service, and has the concurrence of the water agency having jurisdiction, the service to the project shall be provided by the adjoining water agency. Upon application of the subdivider and concurrence of the State and County health agencies, the Commission may waive the requirements of this Section at the time the Tentative Map is submitted for approval.

C.  Written protests objecting to the establishment of any proposed area of benefit for any particular improvement under this Section and Map Act Section 66484 may be filed with the City Clerk by owners of real property within the proposed area of benefit at any time before the close of the required public hearing. If the written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefitted by an improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented to less than one-half of that to be benefitted, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the Council shall not, for one year from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any proceeding for the same improvement or acquisition under the provisions of this Section and Map Act Section 66484. 
1.  Nothing in this Subsection shall preclude the processing and recordation of maps in compliance with other provisions of this Article and the Subdivision Map Act if proceedings are abandoned. 
2.  Any protest may be withdrawn by the property owner making the same in writing, at any time before the conclusion of the required public hearing. 
3.  If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this Article and Map Act Section 66484 to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year; but the Council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement or acquisition so protested against. Nothing in this Subsection shall prohibit the Council, within a one year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the improvement so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefitted are in favor of going forward with the portion of the improvement or acquisition. 
D.  Fees paid in compliance with this Section shall be deposited in a planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund. A fund shall be established for each planned bridge facility project or each planned thoroughfare project. If the benefit area is one in which more than one bridge is required to be constructed, or more than one thoroughfare or portions thereof, a fund may be established covering all of the bridge projects, or all of the thoroughfare projects, in the benefit area. Monies in the fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the improvement serving the area to be benefitted and from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the City for the cost of constructing the improvement. 
E.  In addition to the powers and obligations specifically identified in this Section, the City and subdivider shall have all of the respective powers and obligations identified in Map Act Section 66484 as it may be amended from time to time.

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-66.070 - Kadota Fig Fee Area 
A.  Purpose. Sanitary sewer facilities were completed under proceedings for Assessment District No. 83-1 (Kadota Fig Area). The assessment levied under Assessment District No. 83-1 are based upon the benefit each parcel received from the improvements at the time of the confirmation of the assessments. Those improvements provide identical benefits to new parcels which will be created through future land divisions. The Council established a program to provide for the reimbursement of moneys of the Simi Valley Sanitation Division to pay the obligations of the owners of future parcels through the collection of fees at the time of the filing of new Parcel or Final Maps. 
B.  Fee area established. A fee area has been established in compliance with the authority provided in Map Act Section 66483 to provide for the payment of fees for the reimbursement of costs of sanitary sewer facilities in the Kadota Fig Area in conjunction with and coterminous with Assessment District No. 83.1 (Kadota Fig Area). 
C.  Collection of fees. Fees shall be collected by the Department of Public Works at the time fees for subdividing the properties affected are paid and shall be apportioned by the City Engineer on the basis of benefits conferred on all parcels created after April 13, 1983, and in the same manner and amount as assessments are apportioned for Assessment District No. 83-1 (Kadota Fig Area). 
D.  Deposit of fees/adjustments. The City Treasurer shall deposit fees collected pursuant to this Article into the account of the Simi Valley Sanitation Division.

(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-66.080 - Solar Access Easements 
A.  Applicability. A subdivision requiring Tentative Map approval in compliance with this Article, and that proposes one or more lots that are less than one acre, shall provide solar access easements in compliance with this Section, and as follows: 
1.  The review authority may require the preparation and dedication of solar access easements as a condition of Tentative Map approval for any subdivision application proposing one or more lots under one acre, where: 
a.  Proposed building configuration is specified at the time of Tentative Map submittal, and upon finding that neither lot size, lot configuration or applicable zoning is sufficient to reasonably protect solar access to a proposed south wall, south roof or any proposed location for a solar energy system; or 
b.  Proposed building configuration is not specified at the Tentative Map submittal, and upon finding that neither lot size, lot configuration or applicable zoning is sufficient to reasonably protect solar access to the southernmost boundary of the buildable portion of the lot. 
2.  Solar access easements shall not be required where the lot that would be benefited is one acre or larger, or where solar access is not available due to either existing vegetation, topography or surrounding development, or where other deed restrictions are sufficient to protect solar access. 
3.  The requirements of this Section are not applicable to a condominium project that subdivides airspace in an existing building, where no new structure is proposed. 
4.  The establishment of a solar access easement is not intended to result in reducing development densities or reducing the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a structure, or cause the unnecessary destruction of existing trees. 
B.  Easement design criteria. 
1.  In a proposed subdivision where a building configuration has been developed at the Tentative Map stage, solar access easements created in compliance with this Section shall be designed, to the extent feasible, to protect solar access to proposed south roof and south wall areas and any proposed site for a solar energy system. 
2.  In a proposed subdivision where a building configuration has not been developed at the Tentative Map stage, solar access easements shall be designed, to the extent feasible, to protect solar access to the southernmost boundary of the buildable portion of a lot. 
3.  In establishing the dimensions of a solar access easement, consideration shall be given to contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, existing vegetation and the use of adjacent parcels. 
C.  Easement content. Each solar access easement required in compliance with this Section shall provide: 
1.  A description of the solar access easement in terms of specific areas on benefited property to which solar access is to be protected, and a statement specifying that no structure, vegetation or land use shall cast a shadow so as to impede the passage of direct sunlight to more than 10 percent of a protected area on a benefited property between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on December 21 or on any other date approved by the advisory agency. For purposes of this Section, the easement shall protect and it shall be sufficient to describe only the specific areas on benefited property that would limit the height of structures and vegetation to under 50 feet on the burdened property to protect solar access. 
2.  A diagram of the burdened property indicating in a manner easily understood by nontechnical persons the approximate height restrictions up to and including 50 feet on the property necessary to protect solar access to specific areas on benefited property. 
3.  A statement that the burdens and benefits of the solar access easement are transferable and run with the land to subsequent grantees. 
4.  Because a solar access easement is not intended to unnecessarily burden properties, a statement specifying that, subsequent to the development of a benefited property, restrictions on structures, vegetation and land uses due to a recorded solar access easement on a burdened property not required to protect solar access to a south wall or south roof or the site of a solar energy system shall be void and unenforceable, provided that a revised solar access easement signed by all affected benefited and burdened parties and a revised diagram in compliance with this Section have been recorded with the County Recorder. 
a.  The easement shall also contain a statement that upon refusal of an affected party to sign the modified solar access easement, any other affected party may bring an action in court to determine what modification, if any, should be made to the easement, and that the costs of suit may be awarded to the prevailing party. This provision is not intended to, and shall not increase the area burdened by any solar access easement on any property. 
b.  Where the applicable zoning at the time the solar access easement is recorded would allow the construction of only one primary structure on the benefited property, the provisions of this Subsection (C)(4) shall apply subsequent to Final Building Inspection or the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the principal structure, or any detached solar energy system constructed on the benefited property at the same time as the principal structure. 
c.  Where the applicable zoning at the time the solar access easement is recorded would allow the construction of more than one principal structure on the benefited property, the provisions of this Subsection (C)(4) shall apply subsequent to approval of a complete development plan for the benefited property that indicates the future location of all principal structures and the site of any detached solar energy system. 
D.  Termination of easement. A solar access easement may be revised or terminated in compliance with Subsection C, or by a modification in writing that is signed by all benefited and burdened property owners and recorded with the County Recorder. The right of modification in writing shall not apply to the initial grantor of the easement. 
E.  Recordation. A solar access easement required by this Section shall be recorded with the Parcel Map or Final Map with the County Recorder. 
F.  Appeal. A decision of the review authority in compliance with this Section may be appealed in compliance with Chapter 9-76 (Appeals).

9-68.030 - Applicability of Changes in Requirements 
Any ordinance enacted by the City, including this Article, that changes the amount of land which shall be dedicated by a subdivider for park and recreational purposes, or changes the amount of a fee to be paid in lieu thereof, or changes both requirements, shall only apply to a subdivision for which a Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map has been filed with the City on or after 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance making the change or changes. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.040 - Requirement to Provide Park and Recreational Facilities 
As a condition of the approval of a Parcel Map or Final Map, every subdivider shall dedicate a portion of the land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, as required by this Article, for the purpose of establishing and developing park and recreational facilities to serve the future residents of the divided property. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.050 - Relationship of Land Required to Population Density 
Based upon the standards of the Recreation Element of the General Plan, it is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that five acres of property for each 1,000 persons residing within the City be devoted to local park and recreational purposes, exclusive of and in addition to school lands used cooperatively for recreational purposes. 
A.  Population density. For the purposes of this Article, population density shall be determined as follows, based on the most recent data available in the form of the Federal and State census and studies of population density in the County and City. The density shall be determined by the City at the time it issues a Zoning Clearance in compliance with the following: 
1.  Single-family dwelling units: 3.97 persons per dwelling unit; 
2.  Multi-family dwelling units: 
a.  1.7 persons per one-bedroom/bachelor dwelling unit; 
b.  2.45 persons per two bedroom dwelling unit; 
c.  3.8 persons per three bedroom dwelling unit; 
3.  Mobile homes: 2.03 persons per dwelling unit; and 
4.  Senior citizen dwelling units: 1.7 persons per dwelling unit. 
B.  Determinations of numbers of bedrooms. 
1.  For the purposes of this Section, when a room (e.g., den, study, or sewing room) is provided in conjunction with a one bedroom/bachelor dwelling unit, and the room meets the Uniform Building Code definition of a habitable room, the room shall be considered a bedroom. 
2.  When a room (e.g., den, study, or sewing room) is provided in conjunction with a two-bedroom dwelling unit, and the room meets the Uniform Building Code definition of a habitable room, the additional room shall not be considered as a den, study, or sewing room, but as a bedroom if a wardrobe, closet, or similar facility normally found in a bedroom is proposed and if the room is constructed in a manner that 50 percent or less of one wall is open to an adjacent room or hallway. 
3.  If the City, as part of its issuance of a Zoning Clearance determines that a room can be converted to a bedroom, the room shall be considered a bedroom. 
C.  Determinations of density. 
1.  The basis for determining the total number of dwelling units or bedrooms shall be the number of the units or bedrooms allowed by the City on the land included within the subdivision at the time the City issues a Zoning Clearance. 
2.  The basis for determining the number of bedrooms per dwelling unit shall be the number of the rooms as determined from data submitted to the City and the District by the subdivider and the review and evaluation of the data and the project by the City and the District. 
3.  Where no data is provided, dwelling units shall be treated, for the purpose of determining density, as single-family dwelling units. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.060 - Land Dedication Formula 
The amount of land required to be dedicated by a subdivider in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall be based upon the population generated by the subdivision and shall be computed on the basis of five acres per 1,000 persons. The number of persons anticipated shall be determined by a computation in compliance with the following formula: the number of dwelling units within the subdivision multiplied by population density (number of persons anticipated to reside within each dwelling unit) as identified in Section 9-68.050. The number of persons anticipated to reside within the subdivision according to the computation shall be divided by 1,000, and the result shall be multiplied by five to determine the amount of acreage to be dedicated. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.070 - Amount of Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication 
A.  If it is determined that a fee shall be paid in lieu of the dedication of land, the amount of the fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land, as determined from the Table of Values, which would otherwise be required to be dedicated in compliance with Section 9-70.060 and shall be determined in compliance with the following formula: the number of acres of land that would otherwise be required to be dedicated multiplied by the value of an acre of land within the subdivision as determined from the established Table of Values. 
B.  The computation of the fair market value of an acre of land within the subdivision based upon established ranges in the Table of Values shall be consistent with the zoning of the property at the time the Zoning Clearance is issued by the City and shall be based on the following procedure: 
1.  The City, District, and the subdivider may negotiate and thereafter agree as to the fair market value; or 
2.  If an agreement cannot be reached, a subdivider at the subdivider's own expense, may obtain an appraisal of the land by a real estate appraiser, which appraisal may be accepted by the City and District if found to be reasonable; or 
3.  If the City and District are not satisfied with the subdivider's appraisal, they may cause an appraisal to be made of the land, which appraisal shall utilize generally accepted and recognized methods of real estate appraisal. 
C.  Unless a subdivider retains an appraiser, the City and District's determination of fair market value, shall be final and conclusive. If the City and District do not accept a subdivider's appraisal, their subsequent appraisal in compliance with Subsection (B)(3) shall be final and conclusive. 
D.  This land value procedure shall be reviewed on an annual basis and shall be adjusted to current values on a no less than biennial basis. At the time of the annual review, if land values have not changed in either direction up or down, by at least five percent, no change shall be undertaken until the time of the biennial review. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.080 - Offsite Improvements 
A.  Offsite improvements with dedication of land. If a subdivider is required to dedicate land in compliance with Section 9-68.060, and any property line of the land to be dedicated abuts any street right-of-way, the subdivider shall be required by a condition of Tentative Map approval to improve the street frontages at the time of Final Tract Map or Final Parcel Map approval, with curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities, lights, matching pavement, street trees, the relocation of existing public utility facilities, and the stubbing in of requested utility line services, all to full City standards. At the discretion of the City, however, and with the concurrence of the District, in lieu of providing the improvements, the subdivider shall pay a sum equal to 20 percent of the value of the land, as determined from the established Table of Values, dedicated to pay the District's costs of constructing the improvements. If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land in excess of local standards and/or subdivider-agency agreements, the value of the park and recreation improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by this Chapter. Before the City issues a Zoning Clearance, the City and District shall jointly determine the manner in which a subdivider shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter. 
B.  Offsite improvements with payment of in-lieu fee. 
1.  If a subdivider is required to pay a fee in lieu of dedicating land for park and recreational purposes in compliance with Section 9-68.070, and the park site the District proposes to acquire with all or part of the fee is offsite and bounded on one or more sides by, or abuts, any street frontage, the subdivider, at the time the Zoning Clearance is issued by the City, shall be obligated, by a condition of approval to improve the frontage with curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities, lights, matching pavement, street trees, the relocation of existing public utility facilities, and the stubbing in of requested utility line services, all to full City standards. 
2.  Before the time the City issues a Zoning Clearance the City and District shall jointly determine the manner in which a subdivider shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter. At the discretion of the City, and with the concurrence of the District, a subdivider may fulfill the requirements of this Chapter by: 
a.  Actually constructing the offsite improvements identified in Subsection (B)(1) on a prorated basis in the same ratio as the fee paid in lieu of dedication bears to the total cost of the planned park site; or 
b.  Paying a sum equal to 20 percent of the total amount of the subdivider's in lieu payment to cover the Districts costs in constructing the offsite improvements. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.090 - Determination of Dedication of Land or Payment of Fee 
The following procedure shall determine whether a subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee, or both. 
A.  At the time of application for Tentative Map approval, the subdivider shall indicate whether the subdivider desires to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes, whether the subdivider desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both. If the subdivider desires to dedicate land for the purposes, the subdivider shall designate the area thereof on the Tentative Map following consultation with the City and District as to the appropriate location and size of the area proposed to be dedicated. 
B.  The City and District shall jointly determine, before approval of the Tentative Map, whether to require a subdivider to dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both. 
C.  The decision of the City and District in this regard shall be governed by consideration of the following: 
1.  Adherence to the Recreation Element of the General Plan; 
2.  The topography, geology, access, and location of the land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
3.  The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; and 
4.  The location of existing or proposed park sites and trailways. 
D.  Nothing in this Chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit, or limit in any manner, the City and District from determining the location and configuration of the land to be dedicated. 
E.  The joint determination of the City and District, made at the time of Tentative Map approval, that land shall be dedicated, a fee paid in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, as well as the manner in which the subdivider shall meet the requirements identified in Sections 9-68.060 and 9-68.070 shall be final and conclusive. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.100 - Conveyance of Land and Payment of Fee to District 
A.  Where dedication is required, it shall be accomplished in compliance with the provisions of the Map Act. Real property dedicated in compliance with the provisions of this Section shall be conveyed by grant deed in fee simple to the District by the subdivider free and clear of all encumbrances, except those which will not interfere with the use of the property for park and recreational purposes and which the District agrees to accept. Deeds required to be given shall be deposited with the District before the time of approval of the Final Tract Map or Final Parcel Map by the City. The deeds shall be held in trust by the District until the time the Final Tract Map or Final Parcel Map is approved. If the map is not approved by the City, or the application is withdrawn by the subdivider before the City's approval, the deeds shall be returned to the subdivider. If the map is approved, the deeds received may be recorded by the District. The subdivider shall secure for the District title insurance in an amount equal to the value of the property dedicated. 
B.  Any fee paid in lieu of the dedication of real property shall be deposited with the District before the time the Final Map or Parcel Map is approved by the City. The fee shall be held in trust by the District until the time the map is recorded. If the map is not recorded prior to expiration or the application is withdrawn by the subdivider, the fee shall be returned to the subdivider or a credit given, as provided in Section 9-68.110. If the map is recorded, the District shall retain the fee. Any fee collected under the ordinance shall be committed within five years after the payment of the fees or the issuance of Building Permits on one-half of the parcels created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. The District shall use the fee to provide park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision. Fees conveyed to the District shall be expended only within the City limits, unless the City approves the expenditure of the fees outside the City limits, and the District shall maintain appropriate records to so indicate. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.110 - Credit in Lieu of Return of Deeds or Fees to Subdivider 
If a subdivider does not record a Final Map or Parcel Map prior to expiration or withdraws the application, the District, at its option, shall in lieu of return of deeds and/or fees required by this Chapter, allow the subdivider a credit for the land dedicated, fees paid, or a combination of both, with the qualification that the credit shall only be applied to the land included within the boundaries of the previously approved Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-68.120 - Exceptions to Certain Requirements 
A.  If it is determined that a subdivider shall dedicate land in order to satisfy the provisions of this Chapter, the City may, at the time of approval of the Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map, allow certain exceptions to be made from one or more or all of the following requirements: 
1.  The land to be conveyed to the District for park and recreational purposes actually be located within the boundaries of the proposed subdivision as shown by the Tentative Tract Map, or Tentative Parcel Map, submitted to the City for approval; 
2.  The land to be conveyed to the District, assuming it is to be located outside the boundaries of the proposed subdivision actually be owned by the subdivider or that the subdivider have an interest in the land; 
3.  The land, assuming it is to be located outside the boundaries of the proposed subdivision actually be conveyed to the District before the time of Final Map or Parcel Map approval; and 
4.  The subdivider be obligated to construct, or pay the Districts costs of constructing, offsite improvements in compliance with the provisions of either Section 9-68.080. 
B.  The City and District shall only allow exceptions from the requirements of this Chapter if substantial evidence introduced at the public hearing on the subdivider's Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map shows that all of the following criteria have been met: 
1.  The amount of land to be conveyed to the District by a third person on behalf of a subdivider be, at a minimum, at least equal to the amount of land which the subdivider would ordinarily have been required to dedicate in compliance with the provisions of Section 9-68.060; 
2.  The location of the land to be conveyed to the District by a third person on behalf of a subdivider is consistent with the Recreation Element of the General Plan and of the District's General Plan; 
3.  The District intends to use the land conveyed to it for the development of a park or other recreational facilities to serve the residents of the proposed subdivision; and 
4.  The exception will not impair the public health, safety, and welfare. 
C.  Any exception shall only be authorized by the City as an alternative to the normal requirement of the dedication of land located within the boundaries of a subdivision. If, for any reason, at any time during the process of the issuance of the Zoning Clearance the person arranging the conveyance of real property to the District on behalf of a subdivider cannot complete the transaction, the subdivider shall be required to comply with all provisions of this Section regarding the dedication of land within the boundaries of the subdivision, the payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both as well as constructing or paying the cost of constructing offsite improvements. In this case, the City and District shall jointly determine how the subdivider shall comply with the provisions of this Chapter, and the Zoning Clearance shall not be approved by the City until the requirements have been met. 
D.  If the City allows exceptions to be made from one or more or all of the requirements of this Chapter, the City, may require the subdivider to post with the District a bond, or other form of security, which is jointly acceptable to the City and District, conditioned on the subdivider's faithful performance of all of the requirements imposed by the City as a condition of approval. 
E.  If the City allows an exception to the requirements of this Chapter per Subsection (A)(2), the City shall require the subdivider to enter into a written agreement with the District and with the third person conveying land to the District on behalf of the subdivider, which agreement shall address the criteria identified in Subsection B. The agreement shall be subject to the approval of the City.

9-68.130 - Limitations on the Use of Land and Fees 
The land and fees received in compliance with this Chapter shall be used only for providing park and recreational facilities, and the amount and location of land to be dedicated, the fees to be paid in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, as well as the provision by a subdivider of offsite improvements, shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision development.

9-71.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
This Chapter provides requirements for the implementation or "exercising" of the permits required by this Development Code, including time limits, and procedures for extensions of time. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-71.020 - Effective Dates 
The approval of a land use permit (e.g., Conditional Use Permit, Cluster Development Permit, Planned Development Permit, Temporary Use Permit, Variance, etc.) shall become effective at the end of the 14th day following the date of application approval by the appropriate review authority, unless an appeal of the review authority's action has been filed in compliance with Chapter 9-76 (Appeals). 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-71.030 - Time Limits and Extensions 
A.  Purpose. This Section is intended to provide a method to extend the time originally allowed for use inauguration of a previously approved project that has not expired. 
B.  Time limits. 
1.  Unless conditions of approval or other provisions of this Development Code establish a different time limit, any permit or approval granted in compliance with Chapter 9-52 (Permit Review, Approval, Disapproval or Modification) that is not "vested" within 36 months of its approval shall expire and become void, except where an extension of time is approved in compliance with Subsection E (Extensions of time), below. 
2.  The permit shall not be deemed "vested" until the permittee has commenced actual construction (after obtaining all required Building Permits) or has actually commenced the allowed use on the subject site in compliance with the conditions of approval. 
3.  For the purposes of this Development Code, actual construction shall mean the placing of construction materials for a habitable structure in a permanent manner, excavation of a basement, or demolition of existing structures preparatory to rebuilding. However, the construction work shall be diligently pursued until completion of the subject structure(s). 
4.  The land use permit shall remain valid as long as a Building Permit is active for the project, or a final building inspection or Certificate of Occupancy has been granted. 
5.  If a project is to be developed in approved phases, all subsequent phases shall be vested within 36 months from the approval date. If the project also involves the approval of a Tentative Map, the phasing shall be consistent with the Tentative Map and the permit shall be vested before the expiration of the Tentative Map, or the permit shall expire and be deemed void. Therefore, if the map expires, then the permit expires also. 
C.  Life of approval. An approval shall remain in effect so long as: 
1.  Projects involving the construction of structures. Where project phasing has been approved and substantial site work has been accomplished in a subsequent phase within 180 days of a final building inspection of the last unit in the current phase, the approval shall continue in force. The 12-month time period shall be extended by any time used to process a time extension application, and any appeal in compliance with Chapter 9-76 (Appeals). 
2.  Non-building projects. The project is completed in compliance with Subsection (D)(3) (Project completion defined), below, within 36 months or greater period authorized by an approval or approval of an extension of a project. 
3.  Resource extraction operations. In the case of a resource extraction operation approved in compliance with Section 9-44.190 (Surface Mining Permits and Reclamation Plans), the extraction operations have been commenced. 
4.  Wireless telecommunications facilities. In the case of a wireless facility approved in compliance with Chapter 9-46, the facility operations have been commenced. 
D.  Lapse of approval. In the event that any of the circumstances listed in Subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b) below occur, an approval shall be deemed to have lapsed. No use of land or structure, the approval for which has lapsed in compliance with this Subsection, shall be reactivated, re-established, or used unless a new approval is first obtained. 
1.  Completed projects. When a project has been completed or an authorized use not involving construction has been established, in compliance with Subsection (D)(3) (Project completion defined), below, the approval which authorized the project shall remain valid and in force, including any conditions of approval, unless: 
a.  An approved use authorized through a project approval is removed from the site, and the site remains vacant for a period exceeding 12 months, in which case the approval shall lapse; or 
b.  A structure authorized through a project approval remains vacant and unused for its authorized purpose, or is abandoned or discontinued for a period exceeding 12 months, the approval shall lapse. 
2.  Partially completed projects. Until development rights have vested, its approval shall remain valid so long as the Building Permit remains valid. 
3.  Project completion defined. A development project is considered completed when: 
a.  All structures in a single-family project have been finaled by the Building Official, and site improvements or offsite improvements have been completed and any bonds guaranteeing construction of the improvements have been released by the City Engineer, or in the case of a subdivision, by the Council. 
b.  A Certificate of Occupancy has been issued by the Building Official verifying that all multi-family, commercial, or industrial structures, and site improvements or offsite improvements have been completed and any bonds guaranteeing the construction of the improvements have been released by the City Engineer, or in the case of a subdivision, by the Council. 
c.  When the Director verifies that a use or activity not involving a Building or Grading Permit is occurring on the subject site in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Development Code and any adopted conditions of the associated permit. 
4.  Occupancy or use of partially completed projects. Multiple building projects (e.g., apartment or office complexes or shopping centers) may be granted Certificates of Occupancy for individual completed structures in advance of completion of the entire project when: 
a.  Individual structures, but not necessarily all structures, are completed, in compliance with Subsection (D)(3) (Project completion defined), above; 
b.  The Director determines that the completed structures are capable of functioning independently from the structures remaining to be completed; 
c.  Occupancy of individual structures would not inhibit the completion of the total project; 
d.  Partial occupancy during completion would not have a potential adverse effect on persons in the area or nearby properties; and 
e.  All offsite public infrastructure and onsite site improvements necessary to the proper functioning of the completed structures, as determined by the City Engineer, have been provided. 
E.  Extensions of time. 
1.  Time extension by review authority. The Council, Commission or Director, whichever was the original review authority, may grant time extensions for any approval issued in compliance with this Development Code. 
2.  Sole discretion of review authority. The time limits for any extension of an approval shall be at the sole discretion of the applicable review authority, except where an approval from this Development Code is tied to an approval for a subdivision [Article 6 (Subdivision Regulations)], the time extension, if granted, shall be not less than the time limit remaining in effect for the subdivision, at the time of consideration. 
3.  Time extensions for Tentative Maps, Conditional Use Permits, Cluster Development, and Planned Development Permits by Director. 
a.  One time extension, not to exceed three years, for a previously approved Conditional Use Permit, Cluster Development Permit or Planned Development Permit may be granted; provided, the Director can make the findings identified in Subsection 5, below. 
b.  If a Tentative or Vested Tentative Tract Map or Tentative Parcel Map is extended in compliance with State law (Subdivision Map Act Sections 66452.6 and 66463.5), the companion Conditional Use Permit, Cluster Development Permit, or Planned Development Permit may be extended by the Director for a concurrent period of time. 
c.  One time extension, not to exceed three years, for a previously approved Tentative Map or Tentative Parcel Map may be granted; in compliance with State law (Subdivision Map Act Sections 66452.6 and 66463.5). 
4.  Written request before date of expiration. The extensions shall be requested of the Department in writing, together with the filing fee required by the City's Schedule of Service Charges, on or before the date of expiration of the approval. 
5.  Findings required for extension. The burden of proof is on the permittee to establish with substantial evidence that the permit should not expire. If the review authority determines that the permittee has proceeded in good faith and has exercised due diligence in complying with the conditions in a timely manner, the review authority may grant the requested extension only after first finding that: 
a.  There have been no changes: 
(1)  To the provisions of the General Plan, Development Code regulations, or development guidelines applicable to the project since the approval of the subject project; 
(2)  In the site or its surroundings which affect how the standards of the General Plan, Development Code regulations, or development guidelines apply to the subject project; and 
(3)  In the site or its surroundings which affect the environmental determination previously made for the subject project. 
b.  Substantial site work could not be completed because of circumstances, including market conditions and economics, which are beyond the control of the applicant. (This finding is not applicable to time extensions for a continued use of a previously approved project that as part of its approval allowed the filing of a time extension at a specified time or intervals of time.) 
F.  Continuance of a permit during application renewal process. Unless otherwise provided in the conditions of the permit, or precluded because the findings identified in Subsection (E)(5), above cannot reasonably be made, permits being processed for renewal (time extensions) shall remain in full force and effect and may continue to proceed toward use inauguration, until the renewal request is acted on and all administrative appeals have been exhausted; provided, the renewal application was received by the Department before the expiration of the permit.

9-71.050 - Resubmittals 
A.  Project disapproval. An application may be disapproved with prejudice. 
B.  Disapproval with prejudice. An application may be disapproved with prejudice on the grounds that two or more similar applications have been disapproved in the past two years, or that other good cause exists for limiting the filing of applications with respect to the subject property. 
C.  Resubmittals prohibited within 18 months. If the disapproval becomes effective, no further application for the disapproved request shall be filed, in whole or in part, for the ensuing 18 months, except as otherwise specified at the time of disapproval, for the same or substantially similar discretionary permit, entitlement, or amendment for the same site. 
D.  Director's determination. The Director shall determine whether the new application is for a discretionary land use permit or other approval which is the same or substantially similar to the previously approved or disapproved permit, entitlement, or amendment. 
E.  Appeal. The determination of the Director may be appealed to the Commission, in compliance with Chapter 9-76 (Appeals). 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-71.060 - Covenants of Easements 
A.  Applicability. When necessary to achieve the land use goals of the City, the City may require a property owner holding property in common ownership to execute and record a Covenant of Easement in favor of the City, in compliance with State law (Government Code Sections 65870 et seq.). A Covenant of Easement may be required to provide for emergency access, landscaping, light and air access, ingress and egress, parking, or for open space. 
1.  A Covenant of Easement may be required to provide for emergency access, landscaping, light and air access, ingress and egress, parking, solar access, or for open space. 
2.  The Covenant of Easement may be imposed as a condition of approval by the review authority. 
B.  Form of covenant. The form of the Covenant shall be approved by the City Attorney, and the Covenant of Easement shall: 
1.  Describe the real property to be subject to the easement; 
2.  Describe the real property to be benefitted by the easement; 
3.  Identify the City approval or permit granted which relied on or required the Covenant; and 
4.  Identify the purpose(s) of the easement. 
C.  Recordation. The Covenant of Easement shall be recorded in the County Recorder's Office. 
D.  Effect of covenant. From and after the time of its recordation, the Covenant of Easement shall: 
1.  Act as an easement in compliance with State law [Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 801) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Civil Code], except that it shall not merge into any other interest in the real property. Civil Code Section 1104 shall be applicable to the conveyance of the affected real property; and 
2.  Impart notice to all persons to the extent afforded by the recording laws of the State. Upon recordation, the burdens of the Covenant shall be binding on, and the Covenant shall benefit, all successors-in-interest to the real property. 
E.  Enforceability of covenant. The Covenant of Easement shall be enforceable by the successors-in-interest to the real property benefitted by the Covenant and the City. Nothing in this Section creates standing in any person, other than the City, or any owner of the real property burdened or benefitted by the Covenant, to enforce or to challenge the Covenant or any requested amendment or release.

Chapter 9-72 - Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels 
 
9-72.010 - Purpose of Chapter 
This Chapter establishes uniform provisions for the regulation of legal nonconforming land uses, structures, and parcels. 
A.  These provisions apply to uses and structures which do not comply with the regulations of this Development Code. 
B.  Within the zoning districts established by this Development Code, there exist land uses, structures, and parcels that were lawful before the adoption, or amendment of this Development Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the terms of this Development Code or future amendments. 
C.  This Chapter does not apply to land uses, structures, and parcels that were illegally established, constructed, or divided. These are instead subject to Chapter 9-78 (Enforcement). 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006)  
9-72.020 - Nonconforming Uses and Structures 
The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and structures existing as of the effective date of this Chapter: 
A.  Uses and structures may be maintained. 
1.  Any nonconforming use or structure may be maintained and continued, provided there is no addition, alteration, or enlargement of the area that increases any non-conforming portion of the structure such as a setback, height, or physical limitation. 
2.  So long as a nonconforming use or structure exists upon any parcel, no new use may be established or constructed on the parcel, except as provided by this Chapter. 
B.  Replacement of a nonconforming use. 
1.  A nonconforming use may be changed to a use of the same or more restrictive classification. 
2.  The replacement use shall serve as the bench mark in terms of establishing the acceptable level of nonconformity. 
3.  Where a nonconforming use is changed to a use of a more restrictive classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of a less restrictive classification. 
C.  Nonconforming uses due only to changes in parking requirements. Where uses have been rendered nonconforming due only to revisions in parking requirements, the uses may be continued, replaced, or expanded as follows: 
1.  Replacement of use. Changes of use to a similar use in compliance with Subsection B (Replacement of a nonconforming use), above, with the same or less parking requirements, shall be allowed; provided, current parking requirements can be met for the replacement use. 
2.  Expansion of use. Expansion of the particular use shall be allowed only if the current parking requirements for the area of the expansion can be met, and the addition or enlargements otherwise comply with the applicable current Development Code provisions in effect for the subject zoning district.

3.  Without any further action by the City, a nonconforming use shall not retain the nonconforming protection or benefits provided by this Chapter if: 
a.  The nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use within a structure, ceases for any reason for a continuous period of at least 180 days: 
(1)  A vacant nonconformity may be occupied by a use for which it was designed if so occupied by January 5, 2006 or after the date when the nonconformity first became vacant. 
(2)  If the use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days or more, the land or structure shall lose its nonconforming status, and shall be altered to conform to the current provisions of this Development Code. 
The determination of discontinuance shall be supported by evidence, satisfactory to the Director (e.g., the actual removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, the turning-off of the previously connected utilities, or where there are no business receipts/records available to provide evidence that the use is in continual operation). 
b.  The structure in which the nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is relocated any distance on the site for any reason, or is removed from the site. 
c.  The use of the site after the discontinuance or removal of a nonconforming use shall comply with the applicable current Development Code provisions in effect for the subject zoning district. 
E.  Animal keeping. The keeping of animals as a use, number of animals, type of animals, minimum parcel area required for animals, or other standards for the keeping of animals as an accessory use to residential dwellings not in conformance with current standards shall be deemed nonconforming by the provisions of this Chapter; provided, the animal keeping activities were in compliance with the animal keeping requirements in effect at the time of establishment of the use. 
F.  Made nonconforming by this Development Code. Any legally established use or structure made nonconforming by the adoption of this Development Code shall be considered nonconforming, and fully protected by the provisions of this Chapter. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006, as amended by § 4 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1207, eff. March 28, 2013)

9-72.040 - Exemptions and Exceptions 
A.  Involuntarily partially damaged nonresidential uses and structures. 
1.  Nonresidential uses or structures. Where any nonconforming use or structure is involuntarily damaged or partially destroyed by an Act of God, explosion, fire, or other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, the same may be restored and resumed provided that all reconstruction and repair work shall be permitted and initiated within a period of 180 days. 
B.  Residential uses or structures involuntarily damaged may be reconstructed. 
1.  Single- and multi-family dwelling units. Nonconforming single- and multi-family dwelling units that have been involuntarily damaged or destroyed by an Act of God, explosion, fire, or other catastrophic event, may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure to its pre-existing condition (e.g., building height, density standards, setbacks, and square footage) in compliance with State law (Government Code Section 65852.25) or to current Development Code and Building Code requirements; provided: 
a.  The applicant provides documentation satisfactory to the Director supporting the claim that the damage or destruction occurred involuntarily;

2.  Applicable Development Code provisions. If the preceding requirements are not met, the replacement structure shall comply with the applicable current Development Code provisions for the subject zoning district in effect on the date of application for the required Building Permit. 
C.  Nonconforming structures due only to changed standards. Where structures have been rendered nonconforming due only to revisions in development standards dealing with height, parcel area per structure, parcel coverage, or setbacks, and the use is allowed or conditionally allowed in the subject zoning district, the structures may be continued, expanded, or extended on the same parcel; provided, the structural or other alterations for the expansion or extension of the structure are either required by law, or comply with the applicable current Development Code provisions in effect for the subject zoning district. 
D.  Public utilities exempted. The provisions of this Chapter concerning the required removal of nonconforming uses and structures, and the reconstruction of nonconforming structures partially destroyed, shall not apply to public utility structures when the structures pertain directly to the rendering of the service of distribution of a utility (e.g., electric distribution and transmission substations, gas storage, metering, and valve control stations, steam electric-generating stations, water wells and pumps, etc.); nor shall any provision of this Chapter be construed to prevent the expansion, modernization, or replacement of the public utility structures, equipment, and features, as are used directly for the delivery of or distribution of the service. 
E.  Public acquisition. Whenever any structure or parcel is rendered nonconforming within the meaning of this Chapter by reason of a reduction in a required parcel area, reduction of off-street parking facilities, or setbacks occurring solely by reason of dedication to, or purchase by, the City for any public purpose, or eminent domain proceedings, which result in the acquisition by the City or any agency authorized for the eminent domain proceedings of a portion of the property, the same shall not be deemed nonconforming within the meaning of this Chapter; provided, that if the structures located on the parcel subsequent to the acquisition, are damaged or destroyed, no reconstruction shall take place unless it is in full compliance with the applicable current Development Code provisions in effect for the subject zoning district.

C.  Discontinuance and change of use status. The discontinuance for a period of at least 180 days of a nonconforming use, or a change of nonconforming use to a conforming use, constitutes abandonment and discontinuance, and shall result in termination of the nonconforming status of the use, in compliance with Section 9-72.020(D) (Abandonment or discontinuance of use), above. 
(§ 5, Ord. 1085, eff. January 6, 2006, as amended by § 4 (Exh. A), Ord. No. 1207, eff. March 28, 2013)
