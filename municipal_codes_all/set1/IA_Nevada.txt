the new construction added.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.3)

of the property with the local assessor by February 1 of the assessment year
in which the value added is first assessed for taxation.



      2.   Applications for exemption shall be made on forms
prescribed by the Director of Revenue and shall contain information
pertaining to the nature of the improvement, its cost, and other information
deemed necessary by the Director of Revenue.



8.07   APPROVAL. 



   A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior
approval for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction.  If the
City Council resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and
hold a public hearing thereon.  Thereafter, at least thirty (30) days after
such hearing the City Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a
tax exemption for new construction if the new construction is in conformance
with City zoning.  Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner to
exemption from taxation until the new construction has been completed and
found to be qualified real estate.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)



8.08   EXEMPTION REPEALED.



   When in the opinion of the City Council continuation of the exemption

their expiration.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.5)

mortgagee of record that a hearing on the question of whether or not a

held before the entire Council.  The notice shall advise the above mentioned
interested parties of the time, date and place of the hearing and shall
advise the interested persons of their right to be present and offer evidence
and testimony in opposition to the proposed action, without the necessity of
requesting a hearing pursuant to Section 50.08.  The hearing shall be held
not less than 15 days from the date the notices are mailed to or otherwise
served on the interested parties, and within the time stated in the Notice
for Abatement of the nuisance.  No destruction or demolition by the City
shall commence until the Council has determined, by resolution, after hearing
and notice to the above mentioned interested parties, that a nuisance exists
and that the only appropriate abatement remedy is the complete destruction,
demolition and removal of the offending structure.  The resolution shall
order the City to refrain from commencing the abatement until the owner of

   Any person causing or maintaining a nuisance who shall fail or refuse
to abate or remove the same within the reasonable time required and specified
in the notice to abate is in violation of this Code of Ordinances.



 


Notes

3 
† EDITOR’S NOTE:  A suggested form of notice for the abatement of
nuisances is included in the appendix of this Code of Ordinances.  Caution
is urged in the use of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly
where cost of abatement is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to
whether or not a nuisance does in fact exist.  If compliance is not secured
following notice and hearings, we recommend you review the situation with
your attorney before proceeding with abatement and assessment of costs. 
Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court under Chapter 657 of the
Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

any motor vehicle or machine stored or parked within the corporate limits of
the City, whether on public or private property, which vehicle or machine is
not enclosed in a permanent structure such as a garage or other building
suited for the storage of motor vehicles or machinery, and which because of
any one or more of the following characteristics set forth in the following
paragraphs A through E constitutes a threat to the public health and safety:



         A.   Any vehicle or machine which could not be operated
on the public streets and highways because the same is not currently licensed
under the Iowa Motor Vehicles Laws then in effect;



         B.   Any vehicle or machine with a broken or cracked
windshield, window, headlight or tail light, or any other cracked or broken

by the lack of one or more wheels (exclusive of the “spare”), or the lack
of an engine, transmission, differential, drive shaft, axle or any component
part thereof, which absence or removal makes the vehicle or machine
inoperable by its own power.  Provided, however, this subsection does not
prohibit the owner of a motor vehicle from making ordinary and routine
repairs to any motor vehicle currently registered to said owner or a member
of said owner’s immediate family, while such vehicle is parked on property
owned or controlled by said owner when the ordinary and routine repairs do
not require the vehicle to be inoperable for more than fifteen days.  And
provided further, the 15-day limit referred to in this subsection may, in the
discretion of the Mayor, Police Chief or Council, be extended for an
additional 15-day period if the owner can demonstrate to the Mayor, Police
Chief or Council that it is impossible to complete the ordinary and routine
repairs within 15 days because of the unavailability of parts or other
emergency beyond the control of the owner.  In such a case, the Mayor,
Police Chief or Council may grant written permission for an additional 15-day
period; or



         G.   Any other vehicle or machine which, because of its
defective or obsolete condition, in any way constitutes a threat to the

more of the following:  (i) the current registered owner of any motor
vehicle as shown by the public records of the office charged with licensing
and registering motor vehicles in Iowa or any other state; or (ii) the owner
of the land upon which the refuse, junk motor vehicle or junk machinery is
situated as the same is shown by the public records of the County Auditor. 
In the event the owner of land as described in this subsection does not
occupy or control the property subject to this section, the word “owner”
includes the person in control or in possession of the subject real estate. 
In the case of refuse or junk machinery whose actual ownership is not readily
ascertainable by reference to public records in Story County, the owner of
such refuse or junk machinery shall be deemed to be the same as the owner of
the land upon which the refuse or machinery is located, or the person in
possession of such land, or both.  It is the intent of the Council to impose
vicarious liability upon absent landlords as well as parties in possession
for any violation of this chapter.

inoperative appliances, scrap lumber and building materials, or other

City of refuse or junk or of junk motor vehicles or junk machinery upon
private property constitutes a threat to the health and safety of the
citizens and is a nuisance within the meaning of Section 657.1 of the Code of
Iowa.  If any refuse, junk, junk motor vehicles or machinery is stored upon
private property in violation hereof, the owner as defined in Section 51.01
of this chapter shall be prima facie liable for said violation.  Provided,
however, this chapter does not prohibit the temporary storage of refuse if
the same is enclosed in a water-tight covered container made of galvanized
steel or other non-rusting material.



51.03   NOTICE TO ABATE. 



   Upon discovery of any refuse, junk, junk motor vehicle or junk
machinery stored upon private property within the corporate limits of the
City in violation of Section 51.02 of this chapter, the Police Chief shall
within ten (10) days notify by certified mail or hand delivery all owners
whose identity can be readily ascertained, as said owners are defined
pursuant to Section 51.01 of this chapter, that:



      1.   The refuse, junk, motor vehicle or machine constitutes a
nuisance under the provisions of this chapter;



      2.   The owner must remove the refuse or junk or remove or
repair the motor vehicle or machinery in accordance with the terms of this
chapter; and



      3.   Failure to remove or repair as herein provided will be
sufficient cause for its removal by the City at the owner’s cost, or each
of them, and furthermore, that failure to remove or repair may subject the
owners to a criminal penalty.



51.04   DUTY OF ALL OWNERS TO REMOVE OR REPAIR. 



   Each and every owner who violates the provision of Section 51.02 must
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from the Police
Chief remove all refuse and junk or remove the motor vehicle or machinery to
an auto salvage yard or junk yard duly licensed by the City, or to a lawful
place of storage outside the City limits, or repair the defects which caused
such motor vehicle or machinery to violate the provisions of this chapter,
including licensing if a motor vehicle is not currently licensed.  Mere
licensing of any such motor vehicle shall not constitute a defense to the
finding that the vehicle is a junk vehicle.



51.05   ABATEMENT. 



   If such owner fails to remove said refuse or junk or fails to remove or
repair the motor vehicle or machinery in accordance with the terms of this
chapter, the City shall abate such nuisance by causing the refuse, junk,
motor vehicle or machinery to be removed and disposed of in the case of
refuse and junk, and removed and impounded and sold or disposed of as
specified in this chapter and prescribed for the disposal and sale of
abandoned vehicles, in the case of motor vehicles or machinery.  The cost of
abatement and all charges incidental thereto shall be charged to the owner.

55.09   RESCUE AND IMPOUNDING OF ANIMALS.



   Whenever an animal is found to be either running at large, neglected,
abused, in need of rescue or kept in violation of this chapter, an animal
control officer may impound the animal at a veterinary clinic or animal
shelter.  The owner of the animal shall be responsible for actual costs

may be recovered by the owner upon payment of impounding costs, and if an

to redeem the animal within seven (7) days from the date that the notice is
mailed, or if the owner cannot be located within seven days, the animal shall

the Police Chief is granted the independent authority to issue a Removal
Notice and require an owner of an animal to permanently remove the animal
from the City.  Such requirement will be directed in writing to the owner
and the owner will immediately comply.  If an owner contests that an animal
is a vicious animal, the owner may petition the Council within three (3)
business days of the Removal Notice and request a hearing on the matter. The
hearing shall take place at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City
Council.  However, from the time of Removal Notice and through the time of a
hearing, the owner must comply with the written directive and keep the animal
outside of the City.  If upon written notice, an owner refuses to remove or
at any time brings or keeps the animal in the City, an animal control officer
may take custody of the animal and the animal may be held in impound until a
hearing is held.  The animal owner will be responsible for all costs
associated with impounding and boarding the animal until the time of the
hearing.  If after a hearing, the Council determines the animal to be a
vicious animal, the animal may be euthanized or humanely killed if it is
found to be in the City and the owner shall be responsible for the costs.

(Ord. 934 - Jan. 09 Supp.)




69.14   SNOW EMERGENCY. 



   A snow emergency shall be in force for the purpose of implementing
procedures pertaining to the location, citing, or removal of vehicles parked
on City streets and parking lots that would otherwise impede the progress of
snow removal within the City.



      1.   Definition.  A snow emergency is defined as any
accumulation of snow one (1) inch or more; it shall not require a public
declaration or announcement by the City.



      2.   Notifications.  Signs shall be erected at the main
entrances to the City and entrances to all city parking lots notifying the
public that parking restrictions are in effect between October 1 and May 31.
This may also be posted on the city social media page and posted on the city
website during the months of October through May.



      3.   All Parking Prohibited.  During the time that a snow
emergency is in force, no person shall park, abandon or leave unattended any
vehicle on any public street, alley, or City-owned off-street parking area
from the time there has been an accumulation of one (1) inch of snow until 48
hours have passed or the snow has ceased to fall and has been removed or
plowed from the street, alley or parking area.



      4.   Duty to Remove.  During the time that a snow emergency
is in force, it shall be the duty of all persons who are the registered
owners of vehicles parked on the City streets or in City parking lots, as
well as the duty of any person who has parked a vehicle on a City street or
in a City parking lot, to immediately remove such vehicle from the street or
parking lot within one-half hour from the time that the snow emergency
becomes effective.  For purposes of this section, the phrase "vehicle parked
on a City street or in a City parking lot" or similar words includes vehicles
that have become stuck, snowbound or otherwise disabled on any public streets
or parking lots.



      5.   Issuance of Parking Citation Issuance and Towing of
Improperly Parked Vehicles.  Vehicles found to be parked in violation of
this section may be cited for the violation and, to obviate the safety
hazards occasioned by incomplete snow removal, be summarily towed on orders
of a police officer to some location where the vehicle may be lawfully parked
or to the towing firm's vehicle storage lot.  All costs of such towing,
parking citation, and any subsequent storage shall be assessed against and
paid by the operator or registered owner of the vehicle.  The officer
ordering the towing shall keep a record of each vehicle towed, the place
where it was taken and by whom.  Such action by the City shall not excuse
the owner or operator of the towed vehicle from any of the provisions of
subsections 3 and 4 hereof.



      6.   Redemption of Vehicles.  In the event a vehicle is
impounded, it may be reclaimed by the registered owner or lien holder of
record by payment of the parking citation as well as of all towing and any
subsequent storage costs within ten (10) days of the initial impoundment. 
If not reclaimed within the initial ten (10) days, the provisions of Chapter
80 of the City Code shall govern the redemption of the vehicle.  In the
event a vehicle is moved to another location pursuant to subsection 4 above,
the registered owner of the vehicle shall be liable to the City for the
reasonable expenses incurred in towing and relocating the vehicle and shall
pay the same to the City within fifteen (15) days after a statement from the
City is mailed to the registered owner at the address on the current
registration form as shown on the records of the County Treasurer.




(Ord. 996 - Jan. 18 Supp.)




69.15   PARKING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY PROHIBITED.



   It is unlawful for any person to park a vehicle on land owned or
controlled by another without that person’s invitation or consent.  Any
vehicle parked on private property in violation of this section may be
removed by the owner or person in control of the land upon which the vehicle
is improperly parked.  The owner or driver of the improperly parked vehicle
shall be liable for all towing and storage charges incurred in removing the
vehicle.  The owner or person in control of the land shall not be liable to
the owner or driver of the motor vehicle for any damages arising out of such
removal provided the owner or person in control of the land complies with the
following:



      1.   Has posted in a conspicuous location visible to the

Parking.  Violators Will be Towed at Owner’s Expense” or words of like

   In order to accommodate the special needs of certain residents of the
City, the marked parking stalls located in the City parking lot at Fifth
(5th) Street and K Avenue are hereby designated as a “Permit Parking
Only” parking area.  Vehicles not displaying valid permits are prohibited
from parking in these stalls at any time.  Vehicles displaying valid permits
shall not be prohibited from parking in the remainder of the lot; however,
the provisions of subsection 3 of this section do not apply when permit
vehicles are parked in areas other than the marked parking stalls.



      1.   Application for Permit.  Any resident of the City may
apply to the Police Chief for a special permit parking tag which, if issued
by the Chief, shall be displayed on a hanging device from the inside rear
view mirror at all times when the vehicle is parked in the special permit
area.  The applicant shall complete a written application form provided by
the Police Department, which application shall state the name, address, home
and business phone numbers or business name and address of the owner of the
vehicle, the vehicle’s factory VIN number, the current plate and
registration number and the make, model, year and color of the vehicle.  The
application shall be accompanied by certified funds payable to the “City of
Nevada” in the amount of one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00) and by a
signed Waiver and Release releasing the City of Nevada from any and all
liability arising out of the City’s failure to properly maintain the marked
parking stalls, including but not limited to snow and ice removal.



      2.   Permit.  The annual permit shall be valid from September
1 through August 31 of each year.  Permits shall be transferable from one
vehicle to another, provided the owner provides the Police Department with
the required information pertaining to the replacement vehicle.  Permits are
not transferable from one owner to another.  The Police Chief shall have the
authority to cancel any permit for any reason upon ten (10) days’ written
notice to the owner, served by ordinary first class mail and by posting a
copy of the notice on the vehicle, under the driver’s windshield wiper if
the vehicle can be located on the lot.  In the event the permit is cancelled
by the Chief, the City shall refund the unused portion of the permit to the
owner on a pro rata basis, computed on a monthly basis of ten dollars
($10.00) per month or any portion thereof.



      3.   Exemptions.  The owners of vehicles that are properly
parked in marked parking stalls of the lot and which display a valid permit

property who disputes the planned disposition of the vehicle or property by

abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the
same time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for
mailed notice in Section 80.03.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])



80.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.

notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two (2) or

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])



      1.   Independent Services.  No more than one house, building

cover visible and even with the pavement or ground.



90.15   INTERIOR VALVE. 



   There shall be installed a shut-off valve on every service pipe inside
the building as close to the entrance of the pipe within the building as
possible and so located that the water can be shut off conveniently.  Where
one service pipe supplies more than one customer within the building, there
shall be separate valves for each such customer so that service may be shut
off for one without interfering with service to the others.



90.16   INSPECTION AND APPROVAL. 



   All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must
be inspected and approved in writing by the Superintendent before they are
covered, and the Superintendent shall keep a record of such approvals.  If
the Superintendent refuses to approve the work, the plumber or property owner
must proceed immediately to correct the work.  Every person who uses or
intends to use the municipal water system shall permit the Superintendent to
enter the premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or repairs at all
reasonable hours and on proof of authority.



90.17   COMPLETION BY THE CITY. 



   Should any excavation be left open or only partly refilled for
twenty-four (24) hours after the water service pipe is installed and
connected with the water system, or should the work be improperly done, the
City shall have the right to finish or correct the work, and the Council
shall assess the costs to the property owner or the plumber.  If the plumber
is assessed, the plumber must pay the costs before receiving another permit,
and the plumber’s bond or cash deposit shall be security for the
assessment. If the property owner is assessed, such assessment may be
collected with and in the same manner as general property taxes.

   A separate additional meter may be installed for the purpose of
measuring water usage outside a residence or business when such water is used
in a manner that it does not enter the City’s sanitary sewer system.  The
owner must purchase the extra meter and remote reading equipment from the
City and pay for its installation.  Installation shall be according to the
building inspector’s directives.  The City shall retain ownership of the
meter and shall have the right to inspect said meter from time to time during
normal business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, to
insure proper installation and operation and police for any potential for
bypassing of any meter used for inside use.  A monthly fee and the standard

landlord gives written notice to the City that the property is residential
rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges.  The
City may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of ninety (90) days
of water service be paid to the City.  The landlord’s written notice shall
contain the name of the tenant responsible for charges, the address of the
rental property and the date of occupancy.  A change in tenant shall require
a new written notice to be given to the City within ten (10) business days of
the change in tenant.  When the tenant moves from the rental property, the
City shall refund the deposit if the water service charges are paid in
full.  A change in the ownership of the residential rental property shall
require written notice of such change to be given to the City within ten
business days of the completion of the change of ownership.  The lien
exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for repairs to a water service.

landlord of the property has made a written request for notice, the notice
shall also be given to the owner or landlord.  The notice shall be sent to
the appropriate persons by ordinary mail not less than thirty (30) days prior
to certification of the lien to the County Treasurer.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)

continuous occupancy, but not less than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).  The
deposit may be refunded or credited to the customer’s account after a
period of twenty-four (24) months during which time not more than one late
payment penalty has been assessed.



      2.   The deposit requirement may be waived by the City
Administrator if the customer is the owner of property upon which the water
service is located and the customer has previously established a record of
prompt payment of water bills due the City.



      3.   Any customer who doesnot presently have a deposit on
file, either for reason of refund or waiver and who has been assessed more
than two (2) late penalties within a twelve-month period, shall be required
to pay a deposit in an amount equal to three months’ average use based on
past usage during the most recent period of continuous occupancy, but not
less than $75.00. In these cases, a “Notice of Required Deposit” shall be
mailed by ordinary U.S. mail to the customer.  In addition to notifying the
customer that they must remit the deposit and the reason for its requirement,
the Notice shall also state that if the deposit is not paid within 30 days
from the date of the Notice, the water service may be disconnected pursuant
to § 92.06 of this Code.  Any deposit required under this subsection may be
refunded or credited to the customer’s account after a period of
twenty-four (24) months during which time not more than one late payment
penalty has been assessed.



      4.   In cases where a deposit is on file with the City, but
the customer has been assessed two (2) or more late payment penalties within
a twelve (12) month period, the City may, in its sole discretion, require an
additional deposit of $75.00 in addition to the existing deposit.  However,
the total deposit shall not exceed an amount that is equal to three months’
average use based on past usage during the most recent period of continuous
occupancy.  In these cases, a “Notice of Additional Deposit” shall be
mailed by ordinary U.S. mail to the customer.  In addition to notifying the
customer that they must remit the additional deposit and the reason for its
requirement, the Notice shall also state that if the additional deposit is
not paid within 30 days from the date of the Notice, the water service may be
disconnected pursuant to § 92.06 of this Code.

service to any customer who does not timely remit the deposit or additional
deposit set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of this section.  Termination shall

temporarily discontinued as provided herein there shall be no minimum service
charge.  The City will not drain pipes or pull meters for temporary
vacancies.

the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.  If
no properly located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be
installed by the property owner at the property owner’s expense, at the
location specified by the Superintendent.  The public sewer shall be tapped
with a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer
shall be glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the
sewer.  At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a
manhole unless special written permission is received from the Superintendent
and in accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is
approved.



96.06   INSPECTION REQUIRED.



   All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered
shall be inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent.  As soon
as all pipe work from the public sewer to inside the building has been
completed, and before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be
notified and the Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to
workmanship and material; no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or
trenches filled until after the sewer has been so inspected and approved. 
If the Superintendent refuses to approve the work, the plumber or owner must
proceed immediately to correct the work.

   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.  Where
preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.



97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES. 



   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of
the wastes.  Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent.  The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the
owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.



97.08   TESTING OF WASTES. 



   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at said control manhole.  In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken.  Normally, but not always, CBOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

103.07   EMERGENCY SUSPENSION DUE TO ILLICIT DISCHARGES.



   The authorized employee may, without prior notice, suspend discharge by
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, to the health or welfare of persons or to the storm water
drainage system or waters of the United States.  If the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued, the authorized employee may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to persons or
property.



103.08   SUSPENSION FOR ILLICIT DISCHARGES.



   Any person discharging to the storm water drainage system in violation
of this chapter is subject to termination of their storm drainage access if
such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.  The authorized
employee shall notify the violator in writing of the proposed termination of
its storm drainage access. The violator may appeal to the Board of Appeals
for reconsideration of the decision.  A person commits a municipal
infraction if the person reinstates the storm water drainage system's access
to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of
the authorized employee.



103.09   DISCHARGES FROM INDUSTRIAL AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.



   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such

acceptable to the authorized employee prior to allowing discharges to the
storm water drainage system.



103.10   MONITORING ACCESS.



   The authorized employee is permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as is necessary to
determine compliance.  If a discharger has security measures that require
identification and clearance before entry to its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the authorized
employee.  By way of specification, but not limitation:



      1.   Facility operators shall allow the authorized employee
ready access to all parts of the premises for purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, as well as the
performance of any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.



      2.   The authorized employee shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency or authorized employee to conduct monitoring or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge and install monitoring
equipment as necessary.  The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the discharger at its own expense.  All devices used to measure storm water
flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



      3.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the operator at the written or oral order of the authorized employee and
shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.



      4.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized employee
access to a permitted facility is a violation of this chapter.  An operator
of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with
industrial activity shall not deny the authorized employee reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.



      5.   If the authorized employee has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and they are able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized employee
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.



103.11   USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed Best Management Practices.  These
BMPs shall be part of a SWPPP, necessary for compliance with requirements of
the NPDES permit.



103.12   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.



   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris and other obstacles that would
pollute, contaminate or significantly alter the flow of water through the
watercourse.  In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.



103.13   NOTICE REQUIREMENTS IN CASE OF RELEASES.



   Notwithstanding any other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for the emergency
response of a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system
or water of the U.S., the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release.  In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, the person shall, in addition to any required
Federal or State reporting requirement, immediately notify local emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.  In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the
authorized employee in person, by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the authorized employee within three
business days of the phone notice.  If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.  Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.



103.14   NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



   Whenever the authorized employee finds that a person has violated any
provision of this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency or authorized
employee may order compliance by written Notice of Violation to the
responsible person.  Such notice may require without limitation:



      1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;



      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;



      3.   That violating discharges, practices or operations shall
cease and desist immediately;



      4.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;



      5.   Payment of the City's remediation costs; and



      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
If abatement of a violation or restoration of affected property is required,
the notice shall state a deadline within which such remediation or
restoration must be completed.  The notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline,
the work may be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and
the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator with the costs paid by
the violator within the time specified.  Failure by a violator to meet a
requirement as stated in the notice within the time set in the notice is a
violation of this chapter.



103.15   SUMP PUMPS.



      1.   Except as hereafter provided, it is unlawful for the
owner of any real property to discharge sump pump drainage into the sanitary
sewer system.  It is further unlawful for the owner of any real property
abutting a public way to allow a sump pump discharge line onto the street or
alley except as provided for by the following:



         A.   Existing sump pump discharge lines that drain onto
a public street or alley, may be allowed to continue draining to the street
or alley during the months of April through October of each year, provided
the owner or occupant obtains a permit from the City Building Official.  No
discharge or drainage to a street or alley shall be allowed during the months
of November through the following March of each year. 



         B.   In a bona fide temporary emergency situation such
as a water line breakage within the owner's or occupant's home or an
unexpected flash flood situation, an owner may discharge sump pump water onto
a public street or alley for a period not to exceed 14 calendar days unless
an extension is granted by the City Building Official or designee upon
showing good cause for such extension.  The City Building Official shall be
notified at the earliest practical time in the event of such emergency
discharge.  If the emergency occurs during the months of November through
March, the City Police Department shall also be notified immediately.



      2.   Owners who request a renewable three-year permit to
continue discharging to an abutting street or alley as provided for above,
shall make application to the City Building Official on a prescribed form
without fee.  The City Building Official may revoke the permit for a
violation of this section, for providing false or misleading information on
the Application Form or for any other reason which, in the Building
Official's sole discretion, adversely affects the health or safety of the
citizens or becomes a public nuisance.  The revocation shall be effective
within ten days from the date notice is served on the owner personally or by
certified mail, return receipt.



      3.   The City may at its sole discretion require that a
property owner connect a sump pump drain to the storm sewer or to a collector
line when provided by the City or a developer when it is adjacent to the
property owner's property.



      4.   Prior to every transfer of real property within the City,
whether by Deed or Real Estate Contract and with or without consideration,
the Grantor shall obtain from the City Building Official a Certificate of
Sump Pump Inspection which shall be delivered to the Grantee at the time the
Grantor is required to deliver the Grantor-Seller's Disclosure Statement
pursuant to Iowa Code Section 558A.2(1).  The cost of inspecting and testing
shall be borne by the Grantor, unless the Grantee agrees to pay the cost. 
The Certificate shall state that the Building Official has inspected the
below ground level, if any, and has determined one of the following
conditions exist:  (a) the sump pump drainage system complies with this
section; (b) the system does not comply with this section, and must be
brought into compliance prior to sale, stating the reasons therefor; (c) no
sump pump drainage system has been installed in the lowest level of the
premises; or (d) there is no basement or below ground level within the
structure.  If the Certificate of Sump Pump Inspection indicates that the
real property is not connected to the City's Storm Water System (which, for
purposed of this section, includes all collector lines, intakes and storm
water piping), and there is a Storm Water System within one hundred (100)
feet of the property, the property must be connected to the Storm Water
System prior to the closing of the sale on the real property.  The City or
its designated contractor shall re-inspect and retest the discharge of water
at this time and approve the same prior to closing on the real property. 
The costs associated with connecting to the Storm Water System and any
corrections required to consider a property compliant shall be paid by the
Grantor, unless the Grantee agrees to pay the cost, but shall not be the
responsibility of the City.  As between the Grantor, Grantee, and the City,
once the property has been conveyed, both Grantor and Grantee shall be
jointly and severally liable for a violation of this section and for bringing
the sump pump drainage system into compliance with this section.



      5.   The effective date of this section shall be retroactive
to the November 26, 2007, effective date of Ordinance No. 914 "Sump Pump
Drainage" and all permits and other actions taken under that ordinance shall
remain in full force and effect.




(Ord. 974 - Sep. 13 Supp.)




103.16   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.



   A violation of any provision of this chapter is declared a public
offense and the violator may be charged with a criminal simple misdemeanor or
a civil municipal infraction.  Civil penalties for municipal infractions
shall be fixed by the Council and published in the Appendix to this Code. 
Each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate, distinct
offense or violation.  Service of the Section 103.14 "Notice of Violation"
is not a prerequisite to charging the offender with a misdemeanor criminal
violation or a civil municipal infraction.



103.17   VIOLATIONS AS NUISANCES.



   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided in
Section 103.16, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of
any of the provisions of this chapter is declared to be injurious to the
public health, safety and welfare and is declared a nuisance.  As such, the
same may be abated at the violator's expense by a civil action to abate,
enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of the nuisance, including an action
to recoup the City's costs incurred for remediation of the condition, all in
accordance with the provisions of Iowa Code Sections 364.12(3) and (4) and
related laws of the State of Iowa and the City Code.  Additionally, the City
may seek appropriate abatement orders as a part of a prosecution for a civil
municipal infraction.

106.11   SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL ENTERPRISE.



      1.   Utility Established.  The City hereby establishes a
Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Enterprise in order to collect the funds
necessary from users for the payment of garbage related expenses, including
the payment of the City’s payment to the City of Ames under the Contract
and Agreement for Use and Support of a Solid Waste Reclamation, Recycling and
Disposal System for the period of April 1, 1994, through June 30, 2014.



      2.   A Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Enterprise Fund is
hereby established to receive and disburse funds related to the enterprise.



      3.   Per the following formulas, each utility user shall be
assessed a monthly fee.  This amount shall be billed and collected on each
City utility bill issued.  For the purposes of this section, each dwelling
unit in a multiple family dwelling shall be considered a utility user.  The
individual utility fee or aggregate utility fees due on a multi-family
dwelling shall be assessed on each City utility bill issued for that
dwelling.  Each business and industry shall be assessed a monthly fee double
the residential monthly fee.  A church or other tax-exempt entity shall be
considered a residential unit for the purposes of this section.  The
formulas to establish the monthly fee applicable for each subsequent fiscal
year are as follows:



   (Previous fiscal year per capita billing) x (Official census
population) = Total Fees Due



   (Total Fees Due) divided by (Number of residential City utility bills +
two times the number of business and industrial City utility bills) divided
by 12 = Monthly Per Unit Fee (rounded to nearest five cents)



   Residential Monthly Fee = Monthly Per Unit Fee



   Business or Industrial Monthly Fee = two times Monthly Per Unit Fee
(this amount is taxable for sales tax).



      4.   The fees authorized by this section shall be assessed on
each City utility bill issued on or after July 1, 2005, and shall remain in
effect for the balance of the contract period.  The monthly billing unit fee
shall be adjusted for the July billing cycle annually to reflect the number
of utility bills and per capita billing for the previous fiscal year.



      5.   Payment of Bills.  All solid waste charges are due and
payable under the same terms and conditions provided for payment for a
combined service account as contained in Section 92.05 of this Code of
Ordinances.  The provisions contained in Section 92.09 relating to lien
notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent account.

the City.  The Company, its successors and assigns shall indemnify, defend
and hold the City free and harmless from all claims, damages, costs and
expenses whatsoever (including, but not limited to, court costs, fines,
penalties, and reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, liabilities and causes

right of way, sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent to the Company project
to a condition superior to its immediate previously existing condition. In
case the Company fails to restore City property in accordance with this
section as promptly as is practical, the City and the Company shall meet to
resolve the issue. If the parties agree in writing, the City may complete the
necessary work at the expense of the Company.



110.04   RELOCATION. 



      1.   The City shall have the right to require the Company to
relocate, at its own costs and expense, its existing facilities or equipment

with or obstructs the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of
the street or alley or public improvement. If the City requires the Company
to relocate facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City during the previous five years,
the reasonable costs of such relocation will be paid by the City.



      2.   If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate
its existing facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified
above, or as the result of the initial request for a commercial, private or
other non-public development, the Company shall receive payment for the cost
of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment.



      3.   The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in
designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the
Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under
this section.  The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative location
for the Company's facilities as part of its relocation request.



110.05   UTILITY EASEMENT. 



   At least thirty (30) days prior to the City abandoning or vacating any
street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall notify the Company of
such vacation. If the Company notifies the City within such thirty (30) day
timeframe that the Company has gas facilities in the vacation area, the City
shall grant the Company a utility easement for said facilities.



110.06   CONDEMN PROPERTY. 



   This ordinance shall allow the Company to condemn property when
necessary to provide gas service to its customers, in accordance with the
applicable requirements contained in the Iowa Code.



110.07   SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. 



   Said Company, its successors and assigns, shall throughout the term of
the franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall
furnish uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be
specifically contracted for with consumers; provided, however, that any
prevention of service caused by fire, act of God or unavoidable event or
accident shall not be a breach of this condition if the Company resumes
service as quickly as is reasonably practical after the happening of the act
causing the interruption.



110.08   FRANCHISE FEE. 



      1.   There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of zero percent
(0%) upon the gross revenue generated from sales of natural gas by the
Company within the corporate limits of the City.  The Company shall begin
collecting the franchise fee upon receipt of written approval of the required
tax rider tariff from the Iowa Utilities Board.



      2.   The amount of the franchise fee shall be shown separately
on the utility bill to each customer.  The Company shall remit franchise fee
receipts to the City no more frequently than on or before the last business
day of the month following each calendar year quarter.

required to return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from

111.02   POLES AND LINES; INDEMNIFICATION. 



   The poles, lines, wires, circuits, and other appliances shall be placed

assigns shall indemnify, defend and hold the City free and harmless from all
claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever (including,

      2.   If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate
its existing facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified
above, or as the result of the initial request for a commercial, private or
other non-public development, the Company shall receive payment for the cost
of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment.



      3.   The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in
designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the
Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under
this section.  The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative location
for the Company's facilities as part of its relocation request.

day timeframe that the Company has electric facilities, the City shall grant
the Company a utility easement for said facilities.



111.06   CONDEMN PROPERTY.

plan as filed and approved by the Iowa Utilities Board, as well as all
applicable codes and standards referenced therein.



111.08   STANDARD OF SERVICE. 



   During the term of this franchise, the Company shall furnish electric
energy in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities
Board and the Company's tariffs.  The Company will maintain compliance with
Iowa Utilities Board regulatory standards for reliability.



111.09   UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE. 



   Service to be rendered by the Company under this franchise shall be
continuous unless prevented from doing so by fire, acts of God, unavoidable
accidents or casualties, or reasonable interruptions necessary to properly
service the Company's equipment, and in such event service shall be resumed
as quickly as is reasonably possible.



111.10   FRANCHISE FEE.



      1.   There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of zero percent
(0%) upon the gross revenue generated from sales of electricity by the
Company within the corporate limits of the City.  The Company shall begin
collecting the franchise fee upon receipt of written approval of the required
tax rider tariff from the Iowa Utilities Board.



      2.   The amount of the franchise fee shall be shown separately
on the utility bill to each customer.  The Company shall remit franchise fee
receipts to the City no more frequently than on or before the last business
day of the month following each calendar year quarter. 



      3.   The Company shall not, under any circumstances be
required to return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from
customers and remitted to the City.  In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City's imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers
or calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual
customers the City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by
the Company to provide such data or information.



      4.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any
nature arising out of or related to the imposition and collection of the
franchise fee. In addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting
franchise fees from any customer originally or subsequently identified, or
incorrectly identified, by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or
being exempt from the imposition of franchise fees.



      5.   The City shall be solely responsible for the proper use
of any amounts collected as franchise fees, and shall only use such fees as
collected for a purpose as allowed by applicable law.



111.11   FRANCHISE TERM.



   The term of the franchise granted by this Ordinance and the rights
granted thereunder shall continue for the period of twenty five (25) years
from and after written acceptance by the Company.  The acceptance shall be
filed with the City Clerk within ninety (90) days from passage of this
Ordinance.



111.12   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.



   This Ordinance sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between
the Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may
not be supplemented, superseded, modified or otherwise amended without the
written approval and acceptance of the Company.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the City enact or maintain any Ordinance or
place any limitations, either operationally or through the assessment of fees
other than those approved and accepted by the Company within this Ordinance,
that create additional burdens upon the Company, or which delay utility
operations.

   All transmissions and distribution structures, poles, lines and

distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing
telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee
likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground; provided that such facilities are
actually capable of receiving Grantee’s cable and other equipment without

and distribution facilities or any part thereof aerially or underground. 
Nothing contained in this section shall require the Grantee to construct,
operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as
subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters,
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related
equipment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities
of the respective public utilities provided telephone communications and
electric services are placed underground after the effective date of this
chapter, the Grantee shall only be required to construct, operate and
maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if
it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities’
facilities at the time that such are placed underground.



113.13   REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE. 



   The Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as
necessary, as desirable or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within
the service area.  Whenever the Grantee receives a request for service from
at least twelve (12) subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet
(one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend
its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for
system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers,
provided that such extension is technically feasible, and will not adversely
affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the cable
system, or as provided for under Section 113.14 of this chapter.



113.14   SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE. 



   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.  However, for
unusual circumstances, such as a subscriber’s request to locate the cable
drop underground, existence of more than two hundred fifty (250) feet of
distance from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers or a
density of less than twelve (12) subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand
feet of trunk or distribution cable, cable service or other service may be
made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction,
including cost of material, labor and easements.  For the purpose of
determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be
borne by the Grantee and subscribers in the area in which cable service may
be expanded, the Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction
and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the
actual number of potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of
its trunk or distribution cable and whose denominator equals twelve (12)
subscribers.  Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the
construction and other costs on a pro rata basis.  The Grantee may require
that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by
such potential subscribers be paid in advance.



113.15   SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 



   The Grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic service to
the City’s office buildings, fire stations, police stations, library, Court
House, Gates Hall, and public school buildings that are passed by its cable
system.  The outlets of basic cable service shall not be used to distribute
or sell cable services in or throughout such buildings.  Users of such
outlets shall hold Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims
arising out of their use of such outlets, including but not limited to those
arising from copyright liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this section, the Grantee shall not be required to provide an
outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said
buildings or premises exceeds two hundred fifty (250) cable feet, unless it
is technically feasible and so long as it will not adversely affect the
operation, financial condition or market development of the cable system to
do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the
incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 250 cable feet.  In the
event that additional outlets of basic cable service are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees
associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials.



113.16   EMERGENCY OVERRIDE.



   In the case of any emergency or disaster, the Grantee shall, upon
request of the City, make available its facilities for the City to provide
emergency information and instructions during the emergency or disaster
period.  The City shall hold the Grantee, its agents, employees, officers
and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency
use of its facilities by the City, including but not limited to reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs.



113.17   FRANCHISE FEE. 



   The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee equal to five percent
(5%) of basic revenues (as defined in Section 1.1 of the franchise agreement)
received by the Grantee from the operation of the cable system on an annual
basis; provided, however, the Grantee may credit against any such payments: 
(i) any tax, fee or assessment of any kind imposed by the City or other
governmental entity on a cable operator or subscriber, or both, solely
because of the status as such; (ii) any tax, fee or assessment of general
applicability which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or
subscribers (including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed, both on
utilities and cable operators and their services), and (iii) any other
special tax, assessment or fee such as a business, occupation and
entertainment tax.  For the purpose of this section, the 12-month period
applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall
be the calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City and
the Grantee.  The franchise fee payment shall be due and payable ninety (90)
days after the close of the preceding calendar year.  Each payment shall be
accompanied by a brief report from a representative of the Grantee showing
the basis for the computation.  In no event shall the franchise fee payments
required to be paid by the Grantee exceed five percent (5%) of the gross
revenues received by the Grantee in any 12-month period.  The period of
limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five
(5) years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due.  Unless
within five years from and after said payment due date the City initiates a
lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fee in a court of competent
jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred, and the City shall be stopped
from asserting any claims whatsoever against the Grantee relating to any such
alleged deficiencies.



113.18   RATES AND CHARGES. 



   The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and
equipment as expressly permitted by applicable law.  In the event that basic
cable service rate increases are subject to approval of the City, the Grantee
may, at its discretion and without consent of the City, upon 30 days’
advance notice to the City, increase rates relating to the provision of basic
cable service by an amount determined to be reasonable by the Grantee.



113.19   RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE. 



   The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the
City that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be
governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act
(as such existed as of the effective date of the Cable Act), unless the
procedures and substantive protections set forth therein shall be deemed to
be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent provision of
Federal or State law.  In addition to the procedures set forth in said
Section 626(a), the City agrees to notify the Grantee of its preliminary
assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs
and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee under the then
current franchise term.  The City further agrees that such a preliminary
assessment shall be provided to the Grantee prior to the time that the
four-month period referred to in Subsection (c) of Section 626 is considered
to begin.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
section, the Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of
the then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the City and Grantee may agree to undertake and
finalize negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the
City may grant a renewal thereof.  The Grantee and the City consider the
terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express provisions
of Section 626 of the Cable Act.  A reproduction of Section 626 of the Cable
Act as such existed as of the effective date of the Cable Act is incorporated
herein by this reference.



113.20   CONDITIONS OF SALE. 



   Except to the extent expressly required by Federal or State law, if a
renewal or extension of Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise is
lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the
cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of
the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be
at a fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as
a going concern.  The Grantee and the City agree that in the case of a
lawful revocation of the franchise, at Grantee’s request, which shall be
made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third
party.  The City further agrees that during such a period of time it shall
authorize the Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its
prior franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a
period of time greater than six (6) months from the effective date of such
revocation.  If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in
procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is
reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and City may avail themselves
of any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State law, it being
further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of its cable system
during the six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver or an
extinguishment of any rights of either the City or the Grantee. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, neither
the City nor the Grantee shall be required to violate Federal or State law.



113.21   TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE. 



   The Grantee’s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be
sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an
affiliate, without the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.  No such consent shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of
any rights, title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable system
in order to secure indebtedness.



113.22   TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE. 



   The City may perform technical tests of the cable system during
reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
the normal business operations of the Grantee or the cable system in order to
determine whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof
and applicable State or Federal laws.  Except in emergency circumstances,
such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice
thereof, not to be less than two (2) business days, and providing a
representative of the Grantee an opportunity to be present during such
tests.  In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee.  In the event
that such testing demonstrates that Grantee has substantially complied with
such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by
the City.  Except in emergency circumstances, the City agrees that such
testing shall be undertaken no more than two (2) times per year in the
aggregate, and that the results thereof shall be made available to the
Grantee upon the Grantee’s request.



113.23   BOOKS AND RECORDS. 



   The Grantee agrees that the City may review such of its books and
records, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as are
reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof.  Such
records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records
required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the FCC.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee
shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature.  The City agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the Grantee to it as confidential and only to
disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need
to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. 



113.24   INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. 



   Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and
expense, during the term of the franchise, Comprehensive General Liability
Insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury
and property damage.  Said insurance shall designate the City as an
additional insured.  Such insurance shall be non-cancelable except upon
thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the City.  The Grantee will
provide the City a copy of the insurance certificate.



113.25   INDEMNIFICATION. 



   The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the
City, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for
damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or
bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee’s
construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system, including, but
not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.



113.26   BONDS AND OTHER SURETY. 



   Except as expressly provided herein, the Grantee shall not be required
to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded
the franchise or continuing its existence.  The City acknowledges that the
legal, financial and technical qualifications of the Grantee are sufficient
to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement
thereof.  The Grantee and City recognize that the costs associated with
bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the subscribers in the form
of increased rates for cable services.  In order to minimize such costs, the
City agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during
such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor.  The City
agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related
surety in an aggregate amount greater than $10,000, conditioned upon the
substantial performance of the material terms, covenants and conditions of
the franchise.  Initially, no bond or other surety will be required.  In
the event that one is required in the future, the City agrees to give the
Grantee at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice thereof, stating the
exact reason for the requirement.  Such reason must demonstrate a change in
the Grantee’s legal, financial or technical qualifications which would
materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the
franchise or afford compliance therewith.



113.27   NOTICE OF VIOLATION. 



   In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied
with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the Grantee in writing of
the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance. 



113.28   GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND. 



   Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice
described in Section 113.28 to:  (a) respond to the City contesting the
assertion of noncompliance; or (b) to cure such default; or (c) in the event
that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the
thirty-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and
notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they
will be completed. 



113.29   PUBLIC HEARING. 



   In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as
described in Section 113.28 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
113.29, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within sixty
(60) days after the Grantee is notified of the alleged default, the City
shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the default.  Such public
meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Council,
provided such time is not less than five (5) business days therefrom. The
City shall notify the Grantee of the time and place of such meeting and
provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard. 



113.30   ENFORCEMENT. 



   Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event the City,
after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default of any
provision of the franchise, the City may:



      1.   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided
under the franchise, if any, including without limitation any bonds or other
surety; provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and
in such amount as the City reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the
default;



      2.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek
other equitable relief;



      3.   In the case of a substantial default of a material
provision of the franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or



   4.   Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably
lends itself to such remedy as an alternative to damages.



   The Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply
promptly with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of the
City to enforce prompt compliance.



113.31   ACTS OF GOD. 



   The Grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating
thereto where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes,
acts of God, power outages or other events reasonably beyond its ability to
control.



113.32   MISDEMEANOR. 



   In addition to those criminal and civil remedies provided by State and
Federal law, it is a misdemeanor for any person to create or make use of any
unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically,
inductively or otherwise, with any part of the cable system without the
express consent of the Grantee.  Further, without the express consent of the
Grantee, it is a misdemeanor for any person to tamper with, remove or injure
any property, equipment, or part of the cable system or any means of
receiving cable service or other services provided thereto.  Subject to
applicable Federal and State law, the City may incorporate into its criminal
code, if not presently a part thereof, criminal misdemeanor law which will
enforce the intent of this section.



113.33   DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED. 



   The following documents are incorporated herein by this reference, and
in the case of a conflict or ambiguity between or among them, the document of
latest date shall govern:



      1.   Any enabling ordinance in existence as of the date hereof;



      2.   Any franchise agreement between the Grantee and the City
reflecting the renewal of the franchise, if any;



      3.   A copy of the current rate schedule in effect at the time
of adoption and final approval of the franchise.



113.34   PREEMPTION. 



   If the FCC or any other Federal or State body or agency exercises any
paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of the franchise, then to the
extent such jurisdiction shall preempt and supersede or preclude the exercise
of the like jurisdiction by the City, the jurisdiction of the City shall
cease and no longer exist. 



113.35   ACTIONS BY THE CITY. 



   In any action by the City or representative thereof mandated or
permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable,
expeditious and timely manner.  Furthermore, in any instance where approval
or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.



113.36   CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS.



      1.   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the
following definitions apply:



         A.   “Normal business hours” means those hours
during which most similar businesses in the community are open to serve
subscribers.  In all cases, “normal business hours” include some evening
hours at least one night per week and/or some weekend hours.  The Grantee
will notify its subscribers and the City of its normal business hours.



         B.   “Normal operating conditions” means those
service conditions which are within the control of the Grantee.  Those
conditions which are not within the control of the Grantee include, but are
not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages,
telephone network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions.  Those
conditions which are ordinarily within the control of the Grantee include,
but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate
increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or
upgrade of the system.



         C.   “Service interruption” means the loss of
picture or sound on one or more channels.



      2.   System Office Hours and Telephone Availability.  The
Grantee will maintain a local, toll-free or collect call telephone access
line which will be available to subscribers 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.  Trained representatives of the Grantee will be available to respond
to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal business hours, as defined
herein.  After normal business hours, an access line will be available to be
answered by a service or an automated response system, including a phone
answering system.  Inquiries received after normal business hours must be
responded to by a trained representative of the Grantee on the next business
day.  Under normal operating conditions, as defined herein, telephone answer
time by a customer representative, including wait time, will not exceed 30
seconds when the connection is made.  If the call needs to be transferred,
transfer time will not exceed 30 seconds.  These standards will be met no
less than 90 percent of the time under normal operating conditions, as
measured by the Grantee on a quarterly basis.  The Grantee shall not be
required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with
the telephone answering standards set forth above unless an historical record
of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply with such standards. 
Under normal operating conditions, the subscriber will receive a busy signal
less than 3 percent of the time.  Customer service center and bill payment
locations will be open at least during normal business hours and will be
conveniently located.



      3.   Installations, Outages and Service Calls.  Under normal
operating conditions, each of the following standards will be met no less
than 95 percent of the time, as measured by the Grantee on a quarterly
basis: 



         A.   Standard installations will be performed within
seven business days after an order has been placed.  “Standard”
installations are those that are located up to 125 feet from the existing
distribution system.



         B.   Excluding conditions beyond its control, the
Grantee will begin working on service interruptions, as defined herein,
promptly and in no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes
known.  The Grantee will begin actions to correct other service problems the
next business day after notification of the service problem.



         C.   The Grantee will provide “appointment window”
alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation
activities, which will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour
time block during normal business hours.



         D.   The Grantee shall not cancel an appointment with a
subscriber after the close of business on the business day prior to the
scheduled appointment.



         E.   If a representative of the Grantee is running late
for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the
appointment as scheduled, the subscriber will be contacted.  The appointment
will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the
subscriber.



      4.   Communications Between Grantee and Subscribers.  The
Grantee shall provide written information on each of the following areas at
the time of installation of service, at least annually to all subscribers,
and at any time upon request:



         A.   Products and services offered;



         B.   Prices and options for services and conditions of
subscription to programming and other services;



         C.   Installation and service maintenance policies;



         D.   Instructions on how to use the service;



         E.   Channel positions of programming carried on the
system; and



         F.   Billing and complaint procedures, including the
address and telephone number of the City’s cable office.



   Subscribers will be notified of any changes in rates, programming
services or channel positions as soon as possible through announcements on
the system and in writing.  Notice will be given to subscribers a minimum of
30 days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the
Grantee.  In addition, the Grantee shall notify subscribers 30 days in
advance of any significant changes in the other information required herein.



      5.   Billing.  Bills will be clear, concise and
understandable.  Bills will be fully itemized, with itemizations including,
but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment
charges.  Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing
period, including optional charges, rebates and credits.  In case of a
billing dispute, the Grantee will respond to a written complaint from a
subscriber within 30 days from receipt of the complaint.  Refund checks will
be issued promptly, but no later than either (i) the subscriber’s next
billing cycle following resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is
earlier, or (ii) the return of the equipment supplied by the Grantee if
service is terminated.  Credits for service will be issued no later than the
subscriber’s next billing cycle following the determination that a credit
is warranted.



113.37   GRANTEE RULES AND REGULATIONS. 



   The Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules,
regulation, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as
shall be reasonably necessary to enable the Grantee to exercise its rights
and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure an
uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers.  However, such
rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the
provisions hereof or of Federal and State laws.

an event where multiple peddlers, solicitors, or transient merchants or
vendors will be selling goods, merchandise, or services at a single location
or under one roof, the sponsor may apply to the Police Chief for a single,
special event permit.  The sponsor will be responsible for collecting the
names, addresses and phone numbers of each of the peddlers, solicitors or
transient merchants or vendors who will be selling at the special event. 
This information shall be furnished to the Police Chief along with the
application for the special event so that any reference or background checks
that are deemed necessary can be conducted prior to approval of the permit. 
This information shall also be retained by the sponsor so that customers will
have access to contact persons at each company in the event of any questions,
comments, complaints or concerns regarding any goods, merchandise or services
purchased at the special event.  Each special event permit shall be valid
for a maximum of seven (7) days and the hours of operation may, in the
discretion of the Police Chief, be reasonably greater or lesser than the
hours specified in Section 122.08 above.  The special event permit described

Administrator may proceed to a determination of the complaint in their
absence.

who violates the provisions of this chapter, or may cite the violator for a
municipal infraction.  The City Attorney may seek an injunction from a court
of competent jurisdiction in order to prohibit sales by a peddler, solicitor,
or transient merchant who is in violation of this chapter.  Each sale or
solicitation to sell made in violation of the provisions hereof shall be
considered a separate offense.

(Ord. 951 - Jul. 09 Supp.)





         A.   An exact description of the property, by lot and
street number in front of or along which it is desired to excavate.  A
single excavation shall be deemed to constitute all the excavation or
construction necessary for a single connection, single driveway and adjoining
sidewalk or a cut for installing a main, service, pole or structure not
exceeding one hundred (100) feet in length within public property, or at the
sole discretion of the City, a single continuous project up to 1,320 feet.

any disturbed area within the ROW, together with their contact information.



         D.   Any proposed street or alley closures with the name
and contact information of the firm or individual providing signage that will
meet current City standards.



         E.   The date of commencement of work and the estimated
completion date.



         F.   A statement in bold print that the contractor and
owner understand and agree that "the owner or other entity for whom the work
is being done, if not the owner, shall be responsible to the City for all
work performed."



      6.   Permit & License Fees.  The City shall charge a fee for
the license and permit.  The fees shall be set by resolution of the City
Council and shall be set-forth in the Schedule of Fees in the Appendix to
this Code.



      7.   Notification.  Prior to beginning work, the permit
holder shall be responsible for notifying the abutting property owners within
sixty feet of the work being done of the nature and extent of the work and
the proposed start and finish dates.



      8.   Emergencies.  In an emergency, authorized persons or
companies may commence excavations without a permit, provided they have made
a reasonable effort to inform the City police department, the street
department, the Building Official and the utility companies whose underground
utility lines may be involved or affected in any manner.  Those involved in
the work shall make written application for a permit at the earliest
practicable time.



      9.   New Subdivisions.  A license as specified herein shall
be required, but permit fees will not be applicable for installation or
construction of public improvements within new subdivisions.  A separate
inspection fee and bond requirements are established in the Subdivision
Ordinance.



      10.   Safety Measures.  Any person, firm, or corporation
cutting a pavement or surface or performing work in the ROW shall provide
adequate barricades, signage, fencing and warning lights meeting standards
adopted or specified by the City and shall place such devices so as to
protect the public from hazards, vehicles, equipment, materials, excavated
material and similar items.  The City may require greater protection than
that required by current City standards if the circumstances warrant.  All
costs incurred by the City in providing or maintaining adequate barricades,
signage, fencing or warning lights shall be paid to the City by the permit
holder prior to issuance of a permit.  Where traffic conditions warrant, the
contractor may be required to provide flag persons, if in the judgment of the
Building Official the public safety requires it.  Compliance with City
ordinances and regulations shall not be deemed to waive the requirement that
the contractor shall comply with all the requirements of the labor safety
laws and the rules of the Iowa Department of Labor, nor shall any failure be
deemed a responsibility of the City.



      11.   Backfilling and Restoration.  Streets, sidewalks,
alleys and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be
restored in accordance with the standards promulgated by The Urban Standard
Specifications for Public Improvements (SUDAS) as amended by the City of
Nevada and in a manner satisfactory to the City, at the sole expense of the
permit holder.  All work shall be subject to inspection by the City. 
Backfill shall not be deemed completed, or resurfacing of any improved street
or alley surface begun, until such backfill is inspected and approved by the
Building Official.  No project shall be considered completed unless all
disturbed areas are restored in a manner satisfactory to the City and until
the Building Official or designee agrees to the restoration in writing.  The
permit holder shall provide the City with notice at least twenty-four (24)
hours prior to the time when inspection of backfill or restored disturbed
area is desired. Should any excavation in any street, alley or parking be
discontinued or left open and unfinished for a period of twenty-four (24)
hours after the approved completion date, or in the event the work is
improperly done, the City has the right to finish or correct the work and
charge any expenses therefore to the permit holder. 



      12.   Responsibility for Costs.  All costs and expenses
incident to the excavation shall be borne by the permit holder.  The permit
holder shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be caused by such excavation.



      13.   Standard Specifications.  All work in the right-of-way
shall be done in accordance with the City's Standard Specifications (SUDAS)
as amended by the City of Nevada.



      14.   Removal of Structures in the ROW.  City regulation of
the use of the ROW by abutting private property owners is necessary for the
following reasons:



         A.   To assure that such ROW remains free of unnecessary
impediments to the placement, maintenance and repair of streets, alleys, road
signs, sidewalks, above and below ground public utilities; and



         B.   To minimize tort liability that may arise from
injuries to persons or property occurring on, or as a consequence of
structures located within the ROW.  Abutting private property owners are
entitled to the use of the ROW only to obtain necessary and otherwise lawful
pedestrian and vehicular ingress and egress to private property. The
subsections set forth below shall apply to the removal of driveways,
sidewalks, structures and other man-made objects in the ROW.



      15.   Driveways.  A driveway in use on the effective date of
this section (June 5, 2008) for the purpose of providing vehicular ingress
and egress across the ROW to a garage or all weather surface parking area
located on abutting private property, which ceases after the effective date
of this section to be used for such a purpose, shall be removed from the curb
cut to the property line.  The area disturbed shall be restored and reseeded
and the driveway curb cut shall be removed and replaced in accordance with
City standard specifications.  Such removal to the property line shall not
be required if all of the following conditions are met:



         A.   The property owner desires to use the driveway for
vehicle parking only;



         B.   The portion of the driveway located upon private
property is hard surfaced and sufficient in size to accommodate at least one
parked full-sized four wheeled vehicle.  "Sufficient in size" means an area
measuring a minimum of 10 feet wide and 20 feet long; and



         C.   The parking of vehicles on the driveway is
otherwise lawful and does not violate the nuisance provisions of the Nevada
City Code including, but not limited to those relating to the parking of
vehicles on private property.



      16.   Sidewalks.  A sidewalk in use on the effective date of
this section (June 5, 2008) for the purpose of providing pedestrian ingress
and egress across the ROW to a residence, business or related structure
located on abutting private property, which ceases after the effective date
of this section to be used for that purpose and which does not meet the City
standard specifications for location, shall be removed from the curb to the
property line. The area disturbed shall be restored and reseeded.



      17.   Other Structures.  Any structure or other man-made
object (excluding driveways and sidewalks) located on the ROW in use on the
effective date of this section (June 5, 2008) for any purpose, which ceases
after the effective date of this section to be used for the purpose it served
on the effective date of this section, shall be removed from the curb, or
from its starting point on the ROW to the property line.  The area disturbed
shall be restored and reseeded.  Any structure or other man made object
(excluding driveways and sidewalks) located on the ROW which has not ceased
to serve its original purpose, but which must be removed in order to
accomplish necessary public improvements or public utilities installations in
such ROW, shall be removed at the expense of the public utility and shall not
be restored, rebuilt, or replaced on the ROW. The area disturbed shall be
restored and reseeded at the expense of the public utility.



      18.   Responsibility for Removal.  Except as otherwise
specified herein, the cost and responsibility for removal of structures and
objects from the ROW and for the performance of all work required to comply
with this section, shall be born by the owner of the property abutting the
ROW.



      19.   Refusal to Comply.  Should the required removal not be
performed within the time specified by the City to the owner, the City shall
perform the removal and assess the cost thereof against abutting property
owner by certifying the cost of the removal to the County Treasurer, to be
collected in the same manner as a property tax is collected.  Notice to the
owner shall be given by written notice mailed to the responsible party at the
party's last known address as shown by the records of the County Auditor, by
both certified mail-return receipt, and ordinary first class mail.  Notice
shall be complete upon mailing.



      20.   Authority to Adopt Additional Policies.  The City
Council shall have the authority to adopt, by written resolution, any written
policy, rule or specification relating to or amplifying the terms of this
section.  Once adopted, the policy, rule or specification shall have the
same authority, force and effect as the ordinance codified in this section. 
Copies of all such policies, rules and specifications shall be on file with
the City Clerk and Building Official and shall be available for inspection by
members of the public, the same as the City Code.  Photocopies shall be
provided upon request, for a charge set forth in the Appendix to this Code.



      21.   Penalties.  Any violation of this section may be
prosecuted as a Simple Misdemeanor Criminal Offense or a Municipal Infraction
with a fine or civil penalty established by the City Council and set forth in
the Appendix to this Code.  In addition to any criminal or civil penalty
that may be imposed, the violator shall be liable to the City for all direct
and indirect costs incurred to correct the deficiency or violation, including
but not limited to corrective work performed by the City and any contractor
hired by the City.




(Ord. 931 - Jan. 09 Supp.)




135.11   MAINTENANCE OF PARKING OR TERRACE. 



   It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to
maintain all property outside the lot and property lines and inside the curb
lines upon the public streets, except that the abutting property owner shall
not be required to remove diseased trees or dead wood on the publicly owned
property or right-of-way. Maintenance includes timely mowing, trimming trees
and shrubs and picking up litter.  The areas outside the lot and property
lines and inside the curb lines (otherwise referred to as the “parking”)
shall be planted with grass or, if special permission is obtained from the
Council by the abutting property owner, may be paved with concrete or
asphalt.  No rock, gravel or sand surfaces shall be allowed, as the same
creates a potential hazard to pedestrians.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c])



135.12   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PARKING OR TERRACE. 



   If the abutting property owner does not perform an action required
under the above section within a reasonable time, the City may perform the
required action and assess the cost against the abutting property for
collection in the same manner as a property tax.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2e]) 



135.13   DUMPING OF SNOW. 



   It is unlawful for any person to throw, push, or place or cause to be
thrown, pushed or placed, any ice or snow from private property, sidewalks,
or driveways onto the traveled way of a street or alley so as to obstruct
gutters, or impede the passage of vehicles upon the street or alley or to
create a hazardous condition therein; except where, in the cleaning of large
commercial drives in the business district it is absolutely necessary to move
the snow onto the street or alley temporarily, such accumulation shall be
removed promptly by the property owner or agent.  Arrangements for the
prompt removal of such accumulations shall be made prior to moving the
snow.  The cost of removal of such deposits by the City shall be assessed
against the owner of the property from which the snow was removed at such
rates as may be, from time to time, established by the Council.  Each
24-hour period that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate offense.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12 [2])



135.14   DRIVEWAY CULVERTS. 



   The property owner shall, at the owner’s expense, install any culvert
deemed necessary under any driveway or any other access to the owner’s
property, and before installing a culvert, permission must first be obtained
from the City.  In the event repairs are needed at any time with respect to
culverts, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to make such
repairs, and, in the event the owner fails to do so, the City shall have the
right to make the repairs.  If the property owner fails to reimburse the
City for the cost of said repairs, the cost shall be certified to the County
Treasurer and specially assessed against the property as by law provided. 
The City will specify the type of culvert.



135.15   ERECTION OF POLES. 



   All electric and telephone companies, now or hereafter organized and
established by franchise may be authorized and empowered to erect, maintain
and use along, and upon, and over and across the streets, avenues, alleys and
public highways, such posts, cross arms, brackets, wires and other fixtures
as may be necessary to carry the electric current to their customers and
consumers; provided, always, such posts, cross arms, brackets, wires and
other fixtures shall be erected and put in place under the direction and to
the satisfaction of the City.



135.16   REMOVAL OF POLES. 



   Any pole now set in any of the streets, avenues, alleys or highways
that, in the judgment of the Council, and in the best interests of the City,
should be removed, may be ordered removed by serving a notice upon the owners
thereof, and if said poles are not removed within five (5) days after the
service of the notice, then the City shall cause the same to be removed and
the expense thereof shall be collected from said parties by suit in any court
having jurisdiction.



135.17   SUMP PUMP DRAINAGE. 



   (Repealed by Ordinance No. 950 - Jul. 09 Supp. and reserved for future
use)



135.18   MAIL BOXES. 




   It is unlawful to place any mail box where any part of the box extends
to closer than six inches (6") from the front face of the curb, or in close
enough proximity to the traveled portion of a street or alley so as to
interfere with the operation of snow removal equipment.  The City shall not
be liable for replacing mail boxes installed in violation of this section or
so as to interfere with the operation of equipment used in removing the snow
from the traveled portion of the street or alley.  If a snow removal
equipment hits a mailbox that has been properly installed, the City will
replace the mail box for a value of up to $50.00, if the property owner
desires to replace the mail box the City will reimburse the owner for up to a
cost of $50.00 upon submittal of bills and inspection of the location by City
staff.  Each 24-hour period that a violation continues to exist shall
constitute a separate offense.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2b & e])



136.04   DUTY TO MAINTAIN. 



      1.   Owner's Obligation.  The owner of any property abutting
a public sidewalk shall maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition, in a state
of good repair and free from defects.  The abutting property owner shall be
liable for damages caused by failure to properly maintain the sidewalk.  In
the sole discretion of the City and if funds and personnel are available for
the same, the Building Official may, but is not required to, conduct
voluntary inspections of City sidewalks to assure that the owners of property
abutting sidewalks are complying with the maintenance requirements imposed by
this section.  If, through voluntary inspection or otherwise, it comes to
the attention of the Building Official that an owner of property abutting a
sidewalk is not complying with the maintenance requirements imposed herein,
the Building Official shall cause to be served upon the property owner, by
certified mail-return receipt and by ordinary first class mail addressed to
the property owner's last known address as shown by the records of the County
Auditor, a notice that if the property owner does not cure the defects in the
sidewalk within 60 days from the date of the notice, the Building Official
may, in the sole discretion of the City Council, do so and assess the costs
of such work against the property to be collected as taxes pursuant to
Section 136.05(1).  Notice shall be complete upon mailing.



      2.   Failure to Complete; Penalties.  Failure of the abutting
property owner to complete the maintenance or repairs within 60 days of the
date of notice shall constitute a municipal infraction punishable by a
monetary penalty established by the City Council in the Appendix to this Code
and shall be available to the Building Official as a remedy in addition to
all other remedies in this section and otherwise provided by law.



      3.   Barricades Authorized; Penalties.  In the sole
discretion of the City Council and if funds and personnel are available for
the same, the Building Official or his or her designee may, but is not
required to, place barricades or other devices or materials in such places as
may serve to protect the public from sidewalks that are not in compliance
with the maintenance requirements imposed by this section.  If such
protective devices are placed by the Building Official, they shall not be
removed until all sidewalk defects are corrected.  Premature removal of the
protective devices shall constitute a municipal infraction punishable by a
monetary penalty established by the City Council in the Appendix to this Code
and shall be available to the Building Official as a remedy in addition to
all other remedies in this section and otherwise provided by law.



      4.   Records Kept.  For a period of three years from the date
of the following actions or events, the Building Official shall keep records
of all sidewalk complaints received, all voluntary sidewalk inspections
conducted, notices to cure defects mailed to property owners, protective
devices placed and sidewalk work done by the City and shall make the records
available at a reasonable cost to all persons who claim to have been damaged
or injured as a result of the failure to maintain a sidewalk by an abutting
property owner.



      5.   Recreational Trails Exempt.  This section shall not
apply to multi-use recreational trails.

Council may, on its own initiative, by petition from an interested citizen or
by request from the City Administrator or Building Official, approve or order
the construction or reconstruction of sidewalks upon any street, highway,
avenue, public ground, landing or marketplace within the corporate limits.



      2.   Council May Implement Inspection Program.  The City
Council may, but shall not be required to, adopt by written resolution a
citywide sidewalk inspection program for the purpose of locating defective
sidewalks within the City and notifying the owners of the repairs required. 
Any such program shall be under the general supervision of the City
Administrator and shall be implemented by the Building Official.



      3.   Procedure for Levy of Special Assessments and Financing.



         A.   Construction of New Sidewalk.  If the resolution
ordering construction of a new sidewalk provides that all or any portion of
the costs thereof shall be assessed against the lots or parcels of land in
front of which or abutting which the sidewalk shall be constructed, the
procedures for making and levying a special assessment pursuant to this
subsection and for an appeal of the assessment shall be the same procedures
as are provided in Iowa Code § 384.37, et seq., pertaining to special
assessments.



         B.   Reconstruction of Existing Sidewalk.  If the
resolution ordering reconstruction of an existing sidewalk provides that all
or any portion of the costs thereof shall be assessed against the lots or
parcels of land in front of which or abutting which the sidewalk shall be
reconstructed, the procedures for making and levying a special assessment
pursuant to this subsection and for an appeal of the assessment shall be the
same procedures as are provided in Iowa Code §§ 364.12, 364.13B, 384.59
through 384.67, and 384.72 through 384.75, inclusive.



         C.   Alternative Financing Procedures.  If the City
elects to avoid the assessment procedures mentioned above, the City Council
may adopt, by resolution, any alternative financing procedure allowed by law
which it deems in the best interests of the City and the affected property
owners.  The alternative procedure may include a cost sharing formula if the
Council so elects.

the sidewalk café shall not be permitted within the outdoor dining area or

      14.   City Powers.  The City shall have the authority and
power, acting through the Zoning Administrator (hereafter

of the sidewalk area or adjacent street.  Such problems and conflicts may
arise from, but are not limited to, scheduled festivals and similar events,
parades or marches, repairs to the street or sidewalk or from demonstrations
or emergencies occurring in the area.  To the extent possible, the permittee
shall be given prior notice of any time period during which the operation of
the sidewalk café will be prohibited by the City, but any failure to give
prior written notice shall not affect the authority and power of the City to
prohibit the café’s operation at any particular time.

to obtain a permit shall submit a written application to the Administrator. 
At the time the application is submitted, the applicant shall pay an
application fee as set forth in the Appendix to this Code of Ordinances. 
The application fee shall constitute the annual permit fee in the event the
permit is subsequently issued.  If the application is denied, the
application fee shall be returned to the applicant.  If the permit is
issued, it shall be effective on a calendar year basis and shall be displayed
in a location that is easily visible from the sidewalk café area.  The
application shall be submitted on a form provided by the Administrator.



      17.   Findings and Conditions.  In connection with granting
approval of any sidewalk café permit, the Administrator shall determine that
the proposed operation complies with all the requirements of this chapter. 
The Administrator may impose such additional, reasonable conditions as are
warranted in granting approval to an individual applicant, which additional
requirements are needed to assure that the proposed operation will meet the
operating requirements and conditions set forth in this chapter and to assure
that the public safety and welfare will be protected.



      18.   Insurance.  An insurance certificate naming the City,
its officers and employees as additional insured with comprehensive general
liability limits in the amount of $500,000 combined single limit shall be in

The coverage shall be at least as broad as the ISO Form Number CG0001
covering commercial general liability written on an occurrence basis only. 
A copy of the current insurance certificate shall be maintained on file with
the City Clerk.



      19.   Revocation.  A sidewalk café permit may be revoked by
the Administrator following notice to the permittee that one or more
conditions of the permit or of this chapter have been violated, or that the
sidewalk café is being operated in a manner which constitutes a nuisance, or
that the operation of the sidewalk café unduly impedes or restricts the
movement of pedestrians past the sidewalk café.



   20.   Appeal Process.  Any person or establishment whose
application has been denied or revoked by the Administrator may appeal the
Administrator’s decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission by filing a
written Notice of Appeal with the City Clerk not later than 20 days following
the adverse action by the Administrator.  The Notice of Appeal shall include
a concise statement of why the Administrator’s decision is not supported by
facts, is contrary to this chapter or otherwise contrary to law.

145.02   GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE. 



   All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe or not
provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are
otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use
constitute a hazard to safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of
inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for
the purpose of this chapter, unsafe buildings.  All such unsafe buildings
are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition, or removal in accordance with the procedure
specified in this chapter.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 & 364.12[3a]) 



145.03   UNSAFE BUILDING. 



   “Unsafe building” means any structure or mobile home meeting any or
all of the following criteria:



      1.   Various Inadequacies.  Whenever the building or
structure, or any portion thereof, because of (a) dilapidation,
deterioration, or decay; (b) faulty construction; (c) the removal, movement
or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of
supporting such building; (d) the deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its
foundation; or (e) any other cause, is likely to partially or completely
collapse.



      2.   Manifestly Unsafe.  Whenever, for any reason, the
building or structure, or any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the

      3.   Inadequate Maintenance.  Whenever a building or
structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of
dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined
by any health officer to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such
condition that it is likely to cause sickness or disease.



      4.   Fire Hazard.  Whenever any building or structure,
because of dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is
determined by the Fire Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.



      5.   Abandoned.  Whenever any portion of a building or
structure remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the
building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned for
a period in excess of six (6) months so as to constitute such building or
portion thereof an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public.



145.04   NOTICE TO OWNER. 



   The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every
building or structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged
and, if such is found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter,
the enforcement officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure
written notice stating the defects thereof.  This notice may require the
owner or person in charge of the building or premises, within forty-eight
(48) hours or such reasonable time as the circumstances require, to commence
either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the
building or structure or portions thereof, and all such work shall be
completed within ninety (90) days from date of notice, unless otherwise
stipulated by the enforcement officer.  If necessary, such notice shall also
require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith
and not reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are completed,
inspected and approved by the enforcement officer. 



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12 [3h]) 



      1.   Notice Served.  Such notice shall be served by sending
by certified mail to the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of
the Code of Iowa, if the owner is found within the City limits.  If the
owner is not found within the City limits such service may be made upon the
owner by registered mail or certified mail.  The designated period within
which said owner or person in charge is required to comply with the order of
the enforcement officer shall begin as of the date the owner receives such
notice.

he or she may request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a
written request for hearing within the time provided in the notice.

such building a notice to read:  “DO NOT ENTER.  UNSAFE TO OCCUPY.  CITY
OF NEVADA, IOWA.”  Such notice shall remain posted until the required
repairs, demolition, or removal are completed.  Such notice shall not be
removed without written permission of the enforcement officer and no person
shall enter the building except for the purpose of making the required
repairs or of demolishing the building.



145.07   RIGHT TO DEMOLISH.



   In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice
to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure
or portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building
prosecuted as a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the
enforcement officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice.  A
statement of the cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. 



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])



145.08   COSTS. 



   Costs incurred under Section 145.07 shall be paid out of the City

subsection.  The term further includes all dead trees on public or private
property.  Offensive vegetation does not include shrubbery, trees, flowers
and other vegetation designed for aesthetic landscaping purposes, nor does

      2.   “Parking” means that part of the street, avenue or
highway in the City not covered by sidewalk and lying between the lot line

traveled by vehicular traffic. 



151.02   PLANTING RESTRICTIONS. 



   No tree shall be planted in any parking or street except in accordance

151.03   DUTY TO TRIM TREES. 



   The owner or agent of the abutting property shall keep the trees on, or
overhanging the street, trimmed so that all branches will be at least fifteen
(15) feet above the surface of the street and eight (8) feet above the
sidewalks.  If the abutting property owner fails to trim the trees, the City
may serve notice on the abutting property owner requiring that such action be
taken within five (5) days.  If such action is not taken within that time,
the City may perform the required action and assess the costs against the
abutting property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c, d & e])



151.04   TRIMMING TREES TO BE SUPERVISED. 



   Except as allowed in Section 151.03, it is unlawful for any person to
trim or cut any tree in a street or public place unless the work is done
under the supervision of the City.



151.05   DISEASE CONTROL. 



   Any dead, diseased or damaged tree or shrub which may harbor serious
insect or disease pests or disease injurious to other trees is hereby
declared to be a nuisance.



151.06   INSPECTION AND REMOVAL.



   The Council shall inspect or cause to be inspected any trees or shrubs
in the City reported or suspected to be dead, diseased or damaged, and such
trees and shrubs shall be subject to the following:



      1.   City Property.  If it is determined that any such
condition exists on any public property, including the strip between the curb
and the lot line of private property, the Council may cause such condition to
be corrected by treatment or removal.  The Council may also order the
removal of any trees on the streets of the City which interfere with the
making of improvements or with travel thereon.



      2.   Private Property.  If it is determined with reasonable
certainty that any such condition exists on private property and that danger
to other trees or to adjoining property or passing motorists or pedestrians
is imminent, the Council shall notify by certified mail the owner, occupant
or person in charge of such property to correct such condition by treatment
or removal within fourteen (14) days of said notification.  If such owner,
occupant or person in charge of said property fails to comply within 14 days
of receipt of notice, the Council may cause the condition to be corrected and
the cost assessed against the property. 



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3b & h])



151.07   GROWTH OF OFFENSIVE VEGETATION PROHIBITED. 



   The dense growth of offensive vegetation within the City is
prohibited.  This section does not apply to any lot or parcel of ground
where cultivated, agricultural commodities are planted and harvested within
the City, provided the lot or parcel is regularly maintained and otherwise
free from the type of offensive vegetation that this section seeks to
eliminate.



151.08   DUTY TO REMOVE OFFENSIVE VEGETATION. 



   The owners, agents or occupants of all lots and parcels of ground
within the City limits shall cut or cause to be cut all offensive vegetation
on their respective lots or parcels of ground not later than May 15, July 1
and August 15 of each year.  In any case where the offensive vegetation is
not cut within five (5) days after any date fixed above, it shall be the duty
of the Zoning Enforcing Officer to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
The provisions of this section also apply to all lands and lots abutting on
any street or public way, to that portion of the property that lies between
the property line of the property and the curb line, but only where curb and
gutter have been installed.



151.09   NOTICE TO OWNER, AGENT OR OCCUPANT. 



   If the Zoning Enforcing Officer determines that Section 151.08 has been
violated, the officer shall serve a written notice upon the owner, agent or
occupant of the property, notifying the owner, agent or occupant that there
exists a violation of this chapter and that unless the offensive vegetation
is removed within five (5) days after the date of service of the notice, the
City will proceed to remove the offensive vegetation and assess the costs
against the owner.  Notice is served by personally delivering the notice to
the owner, agent or occupant, by leaving the notice with any adult resident
at the location where the offense exists, or by mailing the notice to the
owner, agent or occupant by certified mail, return receipt.



151.10   REMOVAL BY CITY; ASSESSMENT. 



   If the notice provided in Section 151.09 is not complied with, it shall
be the duty of the Zoning Enforcing Officer to cause the offensive vegetation
to be cut or otherwise destroyed.  The Zoning Enforcing Officer shall make
an itemized report to the Council of all work done, which report shall state
the amount of expense incurred for each lot or parcel of ground; the number
and description of each lot or parcel of ground upon which work has been done
and the name of the owner, agent or occupant, if known, of each such parcel
of land.  The report shall be considered and acted upon as similar reports
are acted upon when special assessments are to be made.



151.11   DUTY TO PAY. 



   It shall be the duty of the person against whose lot or parcel of land
such assessment is made to pay to the City Clerk the amount of each
assessment with ten percent (10%) interest thereon from date of the levy of
the assessment, and in case such assessment or assessments remain unpaid by
November 1 of each year, they shall be certified by the Clerk to the County
Treasurer, and shall be paid to and collected by the County Treasurer as
ordinary taxes.

   This chapter shall be known as the Nevada, Iowa, Building Code, and may
be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as “this chapter.”



156.02   PURPOSE. 



   The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, property,
welfare and safety by establishing reasonable minimum requirements for the
construction, repair, moving, demolition and use of buildings, structures and
related equipment, fixtures and systems.



156.03   DEFINITIONS. 



   [Reserved for future use.]



156.04   ADOPTION OF STATE BUILDING CODE. 



   Pursuant to published notice and public hearing, as required by law,
the Iowa State Building Code, promulgated pursuant to Chapter 103A of the
Code of Iowa, including the one- and two-family dwelling code, is hereby
adopted by reference.




(Ord. 913 - Feb. 08 Supp.)




(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.10[2b] and Sec. 380.10)



156.05   COPIES FILED. 



   Official copies of the aforementioned Iowa State Building Code, the
standard codes adopted therein, and a certified copy of this chapter are on
file in the office of the City Clerk.  Certified copies of this chapter are
also on file in the office of the State Building Code Commissioner and in the
office of the Secretary of State.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.12 and Sec. 380.8)



156.06   BUILDING OFFICIAL. 



   The Mayor shall appoint, with Council approval, the building official,
who is hereby authorized and directed to enforce all the provisions of this
chapter.  The building official shall have the following powers and duties:



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])



      1.   Assistants.  In accordance with established procedure
and with the approval of the Council, the building official may appoint such
number of officers, inspectors and assistants, and other employees as shall
be authorized from time to time. 



      2.   Annual Report.  The building official shall submit a
report to the Mayor and Council, not less than once a year, covering the
administration and enforcement of this chapter during the preceding period. 
Said report shall incorporate a summary of recommendations as to desirable
amendments to this chapter. 



      3.   Records.  The building official shall keep a permanent,
accurate account of all fees and other moneys collected and received under
this chapter the names of the persons upon whose account the same were paid,
the date and amount thereof, together with the location of the building or
premises to which they relate.



      4.   Right of Entry.  Whenever necessary to make an
inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter or whenever the
building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any
building or upon any premises, any condition which makes such building or
premises unsafe as defined in this chapter, the building official may enter
such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to
perform any duty imposed upon the building official by this chapter; provided
that if such building or premises be occupied, the building official shall
first present proper credentials and demand entry; and if such building or
premises be unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the
building or premises and demand entry. If such entry is refused, the building
official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure
entry.  When the building official shall have first obtained a proper
inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner
or occupant or any other person having charge, care or control of any
building or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper demand is made as
herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building official
for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter. 



      5.   Stop Orders.  Whenever any work is being done contrary
to the provisions of this chapter, the building official may order the work
stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in the doing or
causing such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such
work until authorized by the building official to proceed with the work. 



      6.   Occupancy Violations.  Whenever any structure is being
used contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the building official may
order such use discontinued and the structure, or portion thereof, vacated by
notice served on any person causing such use to be continued.  Such person
shall discontinue the use within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice
or make the structure, or portion thereof, comply with the requirements of
this chapter; provided, however, that in the event of an unsafe building the
procedures for the abatement of a nuisance shall apply.



      7.   Authority to Condemn Equipment.  Whenever the building
official learns or ascertains that any equipment, as defined in this chapter,
has become hazardous to life, health, or property, the building official
shall order, in writing, that such equipment be restored to a condition of
safety or be dismantled or removed from its present location.  The written
notice shall fix a time limit for compliance with such order.  No person
shall use or maintain the defective equipment after receiving such notice. 
 



      8.   Liability.  The building official or any employee
charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting in good faith and
without malice for the City in the discharge of duties, shall not thereby
become liable personally and is hereby relieved from all personal liability
for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act
required or by reason of any act or omission in the discharge of duties. 
Any suit brought against the building official or employees, because of such
act or omission performed by them in the enforcement of any provisions of
this chapter, shall be defended by the City until final termination of the
proceedings.   



      9.   Cooperation of Other Officials.  The building official
may request, and shall receive so far as may be necessary in the discharge of
any duties, the assistance and cooperation of other officials of the City.



156.07   BOARD OF APPEALS. 



   The purpose of this section is to establish a Municipal Building Code
Board of Appeals ("Board") to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions or
determinations made by the Building Official relative to the application and
interpretation of this chapter, including duly adopted state and national
building codes.  The Board shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to
Council approval.  The Board shall consist of five members, three of which
shall be individuals knowledgeable by training or education in the
construction industry or the fire service and two members shall be citizens
appointed at large.  Members of the Board shall be appointed for a term of
five years, except when the Board is first created, one member shall be
appointed for a term of five years, one members for a term of four years, one
member for a term of three years, one member for a term of two years, one
member for a term of one year.  All terms shall expire on June 30 of the
appropriate year.  A quorum shall consist of three members.  All members of
the Board shall reside in the City.  The Board may adopt rules of procedure
for conducting its business.



      1.   Powers of the Board.  The Board shall have the power to
hear and determine appeals where it is claimed by an aggrieved party that the
true intent of this chapter or the rules legally adopted hereunder have been
incorrectly interpreted; the provisions of this chapter do not fully apply;
an equally good or better form of construction or alternative materials are
proposed; or to provide a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of the
City's Building Codes.



      2.   Appeal Procedure; Time for Hearing.



         A.   Filing Petition for Appeal; Fee.  Any person
aggrieved by any decision made by the Building Official regarding the
Building Codes may appeal to the Board. The appeal shall be perfected by
filing with the Building Official within ten (10) days from the date of an
adverse decision by the Building Official, a written petition requesting a
hearing of the appeal, setting forth the particular section of the Building
Code involved and a detailed statement of the grounds and reasons why the
decision made should be modified or vacated.  A one hundred dollar ($100.00)
administrative filing fee for residential appeals and two hundred fifty
dollar ($250.00) administrative filing fee for all non-residential filings
payable to the City of Nevada shall accompany the petition.  If the
petitioner fails to file a timely written petition as required herein, it
shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal and the decision of the
Building Official shall be final.



         B.   Hearing Schedule and Notice.  Upon the Building
Official's receipt of a timely filed written petition with the appropriate
filing fee, the Building Official shall promptly notify the Board's
chairperson.  The Building Official shall arrange a time and place for
hearing on the appeal.  Written notification by ordinary first-class U.S.
mail of the time, place and nature of the hearing shall be given to the
petitioner and the individual Board members within ten (10) days after the
petition is filed.  Hearing shall be scheduled no later than thirty (30)
days after the date on which the petition was filed and may be extended for a
reasonable period by the chairperson upon written request of the petitioner
or Building Official, upon a showing of good cause.  If the petitioner fails
to appear at a scheduled appeal hearing, the Board may proceed with the
hearing and make a decision in the absence of the petitioner.



      3.   Hearing Procedure.



         A.   The hearing shall be open to the public and shall
be recorded either by mechanical or manual means.  Opportunity shall be
afforded all parties to respond and present evidence and argument on the
issue involved.  Parties may represent themselves or may be represented by
legal counsel.



         B.   Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious
evidence may be excluded.  A finding shall be based upon the kind of
evidence on which reasonable, prudent persons are accustomed to rely upon for
the conduct of their serious affairs and may be based upon such evidence even
if the same would be inadmissible in a court of law.  The Board shall give
effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law.  Objections to
evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record.  Subject to
these requirements, when a hearing will be expedited and the interest of the
parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be
required to be submitted in verified written form.



         C.   Documentary evidence may be received in the form of
copies or excerpts, if the original is not readily available.  Upon request,
parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original,
if available.



         D.   Witnesses at the hearing, or available persons
whose testimony has been submitted in written form, shall be subject to
cross-examination by any party as necessary for a full and true disclosure of
the facts.



         E.   The Board's experience, technical competence and
specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence.



         F.   The chairperson of the Board or his or her designee
shall conduct the hearing and have power to administer oaths.  The Board may
cause subpoenas to be issued for such witnesses and the production of such
books and papers as either party may designate.  The subpoenas may be signed
by the chairperson of the Board.



         G.   No hearing shall be valid unless a majority of the
Board is present and no decision at the hearing shall be valid and binding
unless reached by a majority of all members of the Board.



      4.   Decision.  The Board shall file its Findings of Fact and
Decision with the Building Official who shall mail a copy of the Decision to
the petitioner.  An appeal of the Board's decision shall be by judicial
review filed with the Story County District Court and shall be filed within
twenty (20) days from the date the Board's decision is mailed to the
petitioner.




(Ord. 937 - Jan. 09 Supp.)

limited liability company, a corporation or any other form of business entity.



      2.   Building Permit Required. No person shall erect,
construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert or demolish
any building or structure or cause the same to be done, without first
obtaining a separate building permit for each such building or structure from
the building official.



      3.   Mechanical Building Permit Required. No person shall
install, alter, reconstruct or repair any heating, ventilating, cooling or

chapter unless a permit has first been obtained from the building official.



      4.   Plumbing Building Permit Required.  No person shall
install, alter, reconstruct or repair any plumbing or drainage system or any
part thereof as defined in the plumbing code adopted by this chapter unless a

      5.   Electrical Building Permit Required.    No person shall
install, alter, reconstruct or repair any electrical conductor or equipment
subject to the provisions of the electrical code adopted by this chapter
unless a permit has first been obtained from the building official.



      6.   Exception.  All permit requirements are subject to the
emergency exception of Section 156.09 below. 




(Ord. 913 - Feb. 08 Supp.)




156.09   EMERGENCY WORK. 



   In emergency situations, work may be initiated without first submitting
a permit application and receiving a permit therefor.  However, a permit
application must be submitted within a reasonable time after the passage of
the critical period.  With this one exception all emergency work must be
done in accordance with this chapter.



156.10   PERMIT APPLICATION. 



   To obtain any required permit, the applicant shall file application
therefor on forms provided by the building official for that purpose.  Each

156.11   PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS. 



   With each application for a building permit, and when required by the
building official for enforcement of any provisions of this chapter, two sets
of plans and specifications shall be submitted.  The building official may
require such plans and specifications to be prepared and designed by an
engineer or architect licensed by the State of Iowa to practice as such. 
Plans and specifications when required shall be of sufficient detail and
clarity to show that the proposed work will conform to the provisions of this
chapter and of all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and
orders.  The building official may waive the filing of plans and
specifications with an application for the following:



      1.   One-story buildings of conventional wood stud
construction with an area not exceeding six hundred (600) square feet.   



      2.   Private garages, carports, sheds, and agricultural
buildings of conventional wood stud construction. 



      3.   Small and unimportant work.



156.12   PLAN REVIEW. 



   Required plans and specifications shall be checked by the building
official.  Such plans may be reviewed by other City departments or personnel
to check compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction.



156.13   PLAN APPROVAL. 



   If the plans and specifications as filed appear to conform to the
requirements of this chapter and other laws and ordinances the building
official shall endorse in writing or stamp on all sets of plans and
specifications “APPROVED.”  Such approved plans and specifications shall
not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the building
official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.19[1])



156.14   PARTIAL PLANS. 



   The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part
of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the
whole building or structure have been submitted or approved provided adequate
information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all
pertinent requirements of this chapter. The holder of such permit shall
proceed at the holder’s own risk without assurance that the permit for the
entire building or structure will be granted.



156.15   RETENTION OF PLANS. 



   One set of approved plans, specifications, and computations shall be
retained by the building official for a period of not less than ninety (90)
days from date of completion of the work covered therein, and one set of
approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant, which
set shall be kept on such building or work at all times during which the work
authorized thereby is in progress.



156.16   ISSUANCE OF PERMITS. 



   When the building official is satisfied that the work described in an
application for a permit and the plans and specifications filed therewith, if
required, conform to the requirements of this chapter and other pertinent
laws and ordinances including any applicable soil erosion control plans, and
that the fees as specified have been paid in full, the building official
shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.19[4])



156.17   VALIDITY. 



   The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and
specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of,
any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.  No permit presuming
to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter shall
be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful. 
The issuance of a permit based upon plans and specifications shall not
prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in said plans and specifications or from preventing building
operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this chapter or
of any other chapter of this Code of Ordinances or of any other ordinance of
the City.



156.18   EXPIRATION OF PERMIT. 



   Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of
this chapter shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if the
building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one
hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such permit, or if the building or
work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after
the work is commenced for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.  Before
such work can be recommenced a new permit shall be first obtained to do so,
and the fee therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit
for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the
original plans and specifications for such work; and provided, further, that
such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year.



156.19   SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION. 



   The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit
issued under provisions of this chapter whenever the permit is issued in
error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of
any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this chapter.



156.20   BUILDING PERMIT FEES. 



   A fee for each building permit shall be paid to the building official
as set forth in the Appendix to this Code of Ordinances.  The permit fee
shall include the plan review fee also set forth in Appendix.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.19[5])



156.21   PENALTY FEE. 



   Where work for which a permit is required by this chapter is started or
commenced without obtaining a permit, the fees specified for such permit
shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any
persons from fully complying with the requirements of this chapter in the
execution of the work, nor from any other penalties prescribed herein.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.19[5])



156.22   INSPECTION REQUIRED. 



   All construction or work for which a permit is required shall be
subject to inspection by the building official, and certain types of
construction shall have continuous inspection by special inspectors, as
specified in Section 156.26.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 103A.19[1])



156.23   LOT SURVEY. 



   A survey of the lot may be required by the building official to verify
compliance of the structure with approved plans.



156.24   APPROVALS REQUIRED. 



   No work shall be done on any part of the building or structure beyond
the point indicated in each successive inspection without first obtaining the
written approval of the building official.  Such written approval shall be
given only after an inspection shall have been made of each successive step
in the construction.  There shall be a final inspection and approval of all
buildings and work when ready for occupancy and/or completed.



156.25   MAINTENANCE. 



   All buildings or structures both existing and new, and all parts
thereof, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All devices or
safeguards which are required by this chapter in a building or structure when
erected, altered, or repaired, shall be maintained in good working order. 
The owner or designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
buildings and structures.  For the purpose of determining compliance with
this section the building official may cause any structure to be reinspected.



156.26   SPECIAL INSPECTIONS. 



   The owner or agent shall employ a special inspector who shall be
present at all times during construction on the following types of work:



      1.   Concrete.  On concrete work when the structural design
is based on compressive strength of concrete in excess of 2,000 p.s.i.



      2.   Masonry.  Masonry work shall have special inspection
when required in the Uniform Building Code. 



      3.   Welding.  On all structural welding.



      4.   Reinforced Gypsum Concrete.  When cast-in-place Class B
reinforced gypsum concrete is being mixed or deposited. 



      5.   Special Cases.  On special construction or work
involving unusual hazards or requiring constant inspection. 



      6.   Exception.  The building official may waive the
requirement for the employment of a special inspector if the building
official finds that the construction or work is such that no unusual hazard
exists.



156.27   SPECIAL INSPECTOR. 



   The special inspector shall be a qualified person approved by the
building official.  The special inspector shall furnish continuous
inspection on the construction and work requiring the special inspector’s
employment. The special inspector shall report to the building official in
writing, noting all ordinance violations and other information as required.



156.28   APPROVED FABRICATORS. 



   Special inspections required by Section 156.26 and elsewhere in this
chapter shall not be required where the work is done on the premises of a
fabricator approved by the building official to perform such work without
special inspection.  The certificate of approval shall be subject to

maintained by the Zoning Administrator.  This map shall bear the signature
of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk under the certification that this is
the Official Zoning Map referred to by this chapter.  This map, together
with all legends, references, symbols, boundaries, and other information,
shall be adopted as a part of and concurrent with these regulations.  Said
Zoning Map shall be prominently displayed in the Council chambers and/or an
area accessible to the public at Nevada City Hall.



         B.   Changes to the Zoning Map.  The Zoning Map may be
changed from time to time by ordinance, following the procedure set forth in
Section 165.22.  Such changes shall be reflected on the Zoning Map.  The
City Clerk shall keep a complete record of all changes to the Zoning Map.



      6.   Interpretation of District Boundaries.  The following
rules shall apply in determining the boundaries of any zoning district shown
on the Zoning Map.



         A.   Where district boundaries are indicated as
approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be considered the
district boundaries.



         B.   Where district boundaries are indicated as within
street or alley, railroad, streams or creeks, or other identifiable
rights-of-way, the centerline of such rights-of-way shall be deemed the
district boundary.



         C.   Where a district boundary divides a property, the
location of the boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the Zoning Map.



         D.   The City Council shall determine any other
uncertainty regarding district boundaries not covered in this section.



      7.   Vacation of Streets and Alleys.  Whenever a public
street or alley is vacated, the zoning district adjoining each side of such
right-of-way shall be extended out to the former centerline.



      8.   Annexation of Territory.  All unimproved or agricultural
territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be considered as
lying in the AR Agricultural/Residential Reserve District until such
classification shall be changed as provided by this chapter.  Any improved
property that is annexed into the City shall be zoned according to the zoning
district that most nearly describes either its present use or the use
proposed by Nevada’s Comprehensive Plan.  This zoning shall be established
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council at the time of
annexation.

Symbol
 
Title
 
Purpose



AR

 

Agricultural/
Residential Reserve District

 

The AR District provides for and preserves the agricultural and rural use of
land, while accommodating very low-density residential development generally
associated with agricultural uses.  This district is designed to maintain
complete agricultural uses within the Nevada extra-territorial
jurisdiction.  In addition, land included in the Urban Reserve in the
Comprehensive Development Plan should be retained in the AR District to
prevent premature or inappropriate development.




RR

 

Rural Residential

 

This district provides for the rural residential use of land, accommodating
very low- and low-density residential environments.  The district’s
regulations assure that density is developed consistent with:  land use
policies of the Nevada Comprehensive Plan regarding rural subdivisions;
levels of infrastructure; and environmentally sensitive development
practices.  The district also accommodates developments that merge urban
living with rural life. 




R-1

 

Low-Density
Single-Family Residential

 

This district is intended to provide for residential neighborhoods,
characterized by single-family dwellings on large lots with supporting
community facilities and urban services.  Its regulations are intended to
minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the
carrying capacity of infrastructure.




R-2

 

Medium-Density
Single-Family Residential 

 

This district is intended to provide for residential neighborhoods,
characterized by single-family and duplex dwellings on relatively large lots
with supporting community facilities and urban services.  Its regulations
are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is
consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.




R-3

 

Urban Family Residential

 

This district is intended to provide for medium-density residential
neighborhoods, characterized by single-family dwellings on moderately sized
lots and low-density, duplex and townhouse development.  It provides special
regulations to encourage innovative forms of housing development.  It adapts
to both established and developing neighborhoods, as well as transitional
areas between single-family and multi-family neighborhoods.  Its regulations
are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is
consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.




R-4

 

Multiple-Family Residential

 

This district is intended to provide locations primarily for multiple-family
housing, with supporting and appropriate community facilities.  It also
permits some non-residential uses such as offices through a special permit
procedure to permit a mixing of uses that have relatively similar operating
and development effects.




 



 

Symbol
 
Title
 
Purpose


R-5
 
Mobile Home Residential
 
This district is intended to encourage properly planned developments for
mobile homes.  It provides opportunities for mobile home development within
planned parks or subdivisions, along with the supporting services necessary
to create quality residential neighborhoods.


UC
 
Mixed Use Urban Corridor
 
This district recognizes the mixed use character of major urban corridors,
including Lincoln Highway, which contains a combination of residential,
commercial and office uses.  These major corridors should include special
aesthetic and sign design standards which will help enhance their status as
principal entrances and arterials in Nevada, and to maintain their character
as urban streets.


LC
 
Limited Commercial/Office
 
This district is intended for office development and a limited variety of
low-impact commercial facilities which serve the needs of residents of
surrounding residential communities.  The commercial and office uses
permitted are compatible with nearby residential areas.  Development
regulations are designed to ensure compatibility in size, scale, and
landscaping with nearby residences.


CC
 
Community Commercial
 
This district is intended for commercial facilities which serve the needs of
markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the overall region.  While
allowed commercial and office uses are generally compatible with nearby
residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics may have more
negative effects on residential neighborhoods than those permitted in the LC
District.  CC Districts are appropriate at major intersections, at the
junction of several neighborhoods, or at substantial commercial sub centers.


DC
 
Downtown Commercial District
 
This district is intended to provide appropriate development regulations for
Downtown Nevada.  Mixed uses are encouraged within the DC District.  The
grouping of uses is designed to strengthen the town centers role as a center
for trade, service and civic life.


GC
 
General Commercial
 
This district accommodates a variety of commercial uses, some of which have
significant traffic or visual effect.  These districts may include
commercial uses which are oriented to services, including automotive
services, rather than retail activities.  These uses may create land use
conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring provision of adequate
buffering.  This district is most appropriately located along major arterial
streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential
districts.



 



 


Symbol

 
Title
 
Purpose


BP
 
Business Park
 
This district is designed to promote the development of planned business
parks that accommodate corporate offices, research facilities and structures
which can combine office, distribution and limited industrial uses.  These
facilities serve a more regional audience, but may provide services to local
residents.  They are characterized by extensive landscaping, abundant
parking facilities and good visual and pedestrian relationships among
buildings.


LI
 
Limited Industrial
 
This district is intended to reserve sites appropriate for the location of
industrial uses with relatively limited environmental effects.  The district
is designed to provide appropriate space and regulations to encourage good
quality industrial development, while assuring that facilities are served
with adequate parking and loading facilities.


GI
 
General Industrial
 
This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses,
some of which may have significant external effects.  These uses may have
operating characteristics that create conflicts with lower-intensity
surrounding land uses.  The district provides the reservation of land for
these activities and includes buffering requirements to reduce
incompatibility.


COS
 
Conservation and
Open Space
 
This district is designed to designate and preserve environmentally sensitive
areas or primary public open spaces.

or phases used in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the
same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this section its
most reasonable application.



         A.   “Actuarial rates” or “risk premium rates”
are those rates established by the Federal Insurance Administrator pursuant
to individual community studies and investigations which are undertaken to
provide flood insurance in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 4014 and the accepted
actuarial principles.  Actuarial rates include provisions for operating
costs and allowances.

percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident.  Such flooding is characterized by ponding or
sheet flow.



         D.   “Area of special flood hazard” means the land
in the flood plain within a community subject to one percent or greater

flood.



         F.   “Base flood protection elevation” means an
elevation one foot higher than the water surface elevation of the base flood.



         G.   “Channel” means a natural or artificial
watercourse of perceptible extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine

or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation
or drilling operations.



         J.   “Existing construction” means (for the purposes
of determining rates) structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975. 
“Existing construction” may also be referred to as “existing
structures.”



         K.   “Factory-built home” means any structure,
designed for residential use:  which is wholly or in substantial part made,
fabricated, formed or assembled in manufacturing facilities for installation
or assembly and installation, on a building site.  For the purpose of this
section, factory-built homes include mobile homes, manufactured homes and
modular homes and also includes “recreational vehicles” which are placed
on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days and not fully licensed for
and ready for highway use.



         L.   “Factory-built home park” means a parcel or
contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more factory-built home lots
for sale or lease.



         M.   “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and
temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land
areas from (i) the overflow of inland or tidal waters; or (ii) the unusual
and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.



         N.   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an
official map of a community, on which the Flood Insurance Study has
delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones establishing insurance
rates applicable to the community.



         O.   “Flood insurance study” means the official
report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The report
contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map and the
water surface elevation of the base flood.



         P.   “Flood plain management” means the operation of
an overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood
damage, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plan, flood
control works and flood plain management regulations.



         Q.   “Flood protection system” means those physical
structural works constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to
reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a “special
flood hazard.”  Such a system typically includes levees or dikes.  These
specialized modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.



         R.   “Flood proofing” means any combination of
structural and non-structural additions, changes or adjustments to
structures, including utility and sanitary facilities, which would preclude
the entry of water.  Structural components shall have the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy.



         S.   “Floodplain (FP)” means that area of the flood
plain, outside of the floodway, that on an average is likely to be flooded
once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence
in any one year.)



         T.   “Floodway (FW)” means the channel of a river or
other watercourse and the adjacent portion of the flood plain that must be
reserved in order to discharge the 100-year flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point
assuming equal conveyance reduction outside the channel from the two sides of
the flood plain.



         U.   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually
expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain
management.  “Freeboard” tends to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the heights
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization
of the watershed.



         V.   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest
natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the
proposed walls of a structure.



         W.   “Lowest floor” means the floor of the lowest
enclosed area in a building including a basement except when all the
following criteria are met:



            (1)   The enclosed area is designed to flood to
equalize hydrostatic pressure during floods with walls or openings that
satisfy the provisions of paragraph (17)(B)(4) of this section; and



            (2)   The enclosed area is unfinished (not
carpeted, drywalled, etc.) and used solely for low damage potential uses such
as building access, parking or storage; and



            (3)   Machinery and service facilities (e.g., hot
water heater, furnace, electrical service) contained in the enclosed area are
located at least one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level; and



            (4)   The enclosed area is not a “basement” as
defined in this section.



   In cases where the lowest enclosed area satisfies criteria (1), (2),
(3) and (4) above, the lowest floor is the floor of the next highest enclosed
area that does not satisfy the criteria above.



         X.   “New construction” means structures for which
the “start of construction or substantial improvement” is commenced on or
after the effective date of the FIRM.



         Y.   “100-year flood” means the base flood having a
one percent chance of annual occurrence.



         Z.   “Overlay district” means a district which acts
in conjunction with the underlying zoning district or districts.



         AA.   “Start of construction,” for other than new
construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources
Act (Pub. L97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, providing the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date.  The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of
street and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it
include the installation of the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure, for a substantial improvement, or other structural part of the
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building.  For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.



         BB.   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building
that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home, and a gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.



         CC.   “Substantial damage” means damage of any
origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure
to its before-damage condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.



         DD.   “Substantial improvement” means any repair,
reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (i) before the
improvement or repair is started, or (ii) if the structure has been damaged
and is being restored, before the damage occurred.  For the purpose of this
definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.  The term does not, however, include either (a)
any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or
local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (b) any alteration of a
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.



         EE.   “Variance” means a grant of relief to a person
from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner
otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result
in unnecessary hardship.



      3.   Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation.  Flood
hazard areas of the City of Nevada, Iowa, are subject to inundation which
results in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.  These flood
losses are caused by (a) the cumulative effect of development in any
delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and
(b) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages.  This section uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood
hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps.



         A.   Selection of a base flood which is based upon
engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors
as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the depth of
inundation.  The base flood selected for this section is representative of
large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to
occur on the particular streams subject to this section.  It is in the
general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance
of occurrence in any one year, as delineated by applicable Flood Insurance
Studies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Flood Insurance Rate
Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or any subsequent effective Flood
Insurance Studies, Rate Maps, and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps issued
after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance and adopted by the City of
Nevada.



         B.   Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over
bank areas to convey the base flood.



         C.   Computation of the floodway required to convey this
flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point.



         D.   Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within
which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood
height.



         E.   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area
outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to
inundation by the base flood.



      4.   Lands to Which Section Applies.  This section applies to
all lands within the jurisdiction of the City identified on the Story County,
Iowa, and Incorporated Communities Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Panels
187, 188, 189, 191, and 193, dated February 20, 2008, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency as numbered and unnumbered A zone and/or within
the Overlay Districts FP and FW established in this section.  In all areas
covered by this section, no development shall be permitted except upon a
permit to develop granted by the City under such safeguards and restrictions
as the City may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the
general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community as contained in
this Code of Ordinances.




(Ord. 922 - Feb. 08 Supp.)




      5.   Enforcement Officer.  The Zoning Administrator is hereby
designated as the City Council’s duly designated Enforcement Officer under
this section.  Unless otherwise provided by the City Council, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) shall assist the City on
interpretation of floodplain/floodway rules and regulations.  The
Enforcement Officer shall obtain comments from the IDNR as part of his/her
review of all proposed activity in this Overlay District.



      6.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries.  The
boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be
determined by scaling distances from appropriate maps.  Where interpretation
is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown
on the appropriate maps, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement
Officer shall make the necessary interpretation.  In such cases where the
interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the
dispute.  The base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the
governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land.  The person
contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his/her case to the Board and to submit his/her own
technical evidence if he/she so desires.



      7.   Compliance.  No development located within known flood
hazard areas of the community shall be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section
and other applicable regulations.



      8.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  It is not intended
by this section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions.  However, where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provision of this section shall prevail.  All other
ordinances inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent
of the inconsistency only.



      9.   Interpretation.  In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State
statute.



   10.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood
protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. 
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be
increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris.  This section does not imply that areas outside
floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted
within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This
section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Nevada or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from
reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.



      11.   Application for Appeal.  Where a request for a permit
to develop is denied by the Zoning Administrator, the applicant may apply for
such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment.  Procedures for
appeals to the Board of Adjustment shall proceed as set forth by Section
165.22(8) of this chapter.



      12.   Permit Required.  No person shall initiate any
development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without
first obtaining a separate permit for development as defined in this section.



   13.   Administration.  The Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed
to administer and implement the provisions of this section.  Duties of the
Zoning Administrator include, but are not limited to:



         A.   Review all development permits to assure that sites
are reasonably safe from flooding and that the permit requirements of this
section have been satisfied.



         B.   Review permits for proposed development to assure
that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or
Local Governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.



         C.   Notify adjacent communities and the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration when participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.



         D.   Notify the Iowa Department of Natural Resources of
any proposed construction and development activity in floodplain areas,
and/or upon land situated within the Floodplain/Floodway Overlay Zoning

altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity is not diminished.



         F.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures.



         G.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have
been flood proofed.



         H.   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the Zoning Administrator shall be presented certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect.



      14.   Application for Permit.  To obtain a permit, the
applicant shall first file an application in writing on a form furnished for
that purpose.  Every such application shall:



         A.   Identify and describe the work to be covered by the
permit.



         B.   Describe the land on which the proposed work is to
be done by lot, block, tract and house and street address, or similar
description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed
building or work.



         C.   Indicate the use or occupancy for which the
proposed work is intended.



         D.   Be accompanied by plans for the proposed
construction.



         E.   Be signed by the permittee or an authorized agent
who may be required to submit evidence to indicate such authority.



         F.   Give such other information as reasonably may be
required by the Zoning Administrator.



      15.   Zoning (Overlay) Districts.  The flood plain areas
within the jurisdiction of this section are hereby divided into the following
districts:  (i) Floodway District (FW), (ii) Floodway Fringe District (FF),
(iii) General Flood Plain District (FP) and (iv) Shallow Flooding District
(SF).  The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Flood Plain Zoning

allowed as a permitted or conditional use shall meet the following standards.



            (1)   No use shall be permitted in the Floodway
District that would result in any increase in the 100-year flood level. 
Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be
based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands. 



            (2)   All uses within the Floodway District shall:



               a.   Be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.



               b.   Use construction methods and practices
that will minimize flood damage.



               c.   Use construction materials and utility
equipment that are resistant to flood damage.



            (3)   No use shall affect the capacity or
conveyance of the channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream,
drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system.



            (4)   Structures, buildings and sanitary and

flood damage potential and shall not be for human habitation.



            (6)   Storage of materials or equipment that are
buoyant, flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited.  Storage of other material may be allowed if readily removable
from the Floodway District within the time available after flood warning.



            (7)   Watercourse alterations or relocations
(channel changes and modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion.  In addition,
such alterations or relocations must be approved by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources.



            (8)   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be
shown to have some beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum
amount necessary.



            (9)   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering or due to the
action of flood flows.



      17.   Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District FF.



         A.   Permitted Uses.  All uses within the Floodway
Fringe District shall be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited
by any other ordinance (or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet
applicable performance standards of the Floodway Fringe District.



         B.   Performance Standards.  All uses must be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following
applicable performance standards.



            (1)   All structures shall:



               a.   Be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.



               b.   Use construction methods and practices
that will minimize flood damage.



               c.   Use construction materials and utility
equipment that are resistant to flood damage.



            (2)   Residential Buildings.  All new or
substantially improved residential structures shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year
flood level.  Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all
points, be no lower than one foot above the 100-year flood level and extend
at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected
thereon.  Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers) may be allowed
subject to favorable consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing
topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill.  In
such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as
well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding. 
All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of access which
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.



            (3)   Nonresidential Buildings.  All new or
substantially improved nonresidential buildings shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood
level, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood
proofed to such a level.  When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the
100-year flood; and that the structure, below the 100-year flood level is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water.  A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
National Geodetic Vertical Datum) to which any structures are flood proofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator.



            (4)   All new and substantially improved
structures:



               a.   Fully enclosed areas below the
“lowest floor” (not including basements) that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:  (i)
a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided; (ii) the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and (iii) openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.  Such areas shall be used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access and low damage potential storage.



               b.   New and substantially improved
structures must be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.



               c.   New and substantially improved
structures must be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.



            (5)   Factory-built homes:



               a.   All factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level.



               b.   All factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.  Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors.



            (6)   Utility and Sanitary Systems:



               a.   On-site waste disposal and water supply
systems shall be located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or
contamination from the system during flooding.



               b.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage
systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the system as well as the discharge of effluent into flood
waters.  Wastewater treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall
be provided with a level of flood protection equal to or greater than one (1)
foot above the 100-year flood elevation.



               c.   New or replacement water supply systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the system.  Water supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems)
shall be provided with a level of protection equal to or greater than one (1)
foot above the 100-year flood elevation.



               d.   Utilities such as gas or electrical
systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage to the system and the risk associated with such flood damaged or
impaired systems.



            (7)   Storage of materials and equipment that are
flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood
level.  Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or
(i) not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement
due to flood waters or (ii) be readily removable from the area within the
time available after flood warning.



            (8)   Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a
100-year flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage.  In addition, structural flood
control works shall be approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.



            (9)   Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion.  In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.



            (10)   Subdivisions (including factory-built home
parks and subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage.  Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the
installation of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance
standards of this Ordinance.  Subdivision proposals intended for residential
use shall provide all lots with a means of access which will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.  Proposals for subdivisions
greater than five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots (whichever is less) shall
include 100-year flood elevation data for those areas located within the
Flood Plain (Overlay) District.



            (11)   Accessory Structures.  Detached garages,
sheds and similar structures accessory to a residential use are exempt from
the 100-year flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are
satisfied. 



               a.   The structure shall not be used for
human habitation.



               b.   The structure shall be designed to have
low flood damage potential.



               c.   The structure shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of
floodwaters.



               d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored
to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures.



               e.   The structure’s service facilities
such as electrical and heating equipment shall be elevated or flood proofed
to at least one foot above the 100-year flood level.



   Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage
of the structure and its contents.



            (12)   Recreational Vehicles.  Recreational
vehicles are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 17(B)(5) of this
section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when the
following criteria are satisfied. 



               a.   The recreational vehicle shall be
located on the site for less than 180 consecutive days, and



               b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully
licensed and ready for highway use.  A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system and is attached to the
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no
permanently attached additions.



   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of paragraph 17(B)(5) of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of
factory-built homes.



            (13)   Pipeline river and stream crossings shall
be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.



      18.   General Flood Plain (Overlay) District FP.



         A.   Permitted Uses.  The following uses are permitted

other lands to the injury of others.



            (2)   The danger of life and property due to
flooding or erosion damage.



            (3)   The susceptibility of proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



            (4)   The importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community.



            (5)   The necessity to the facility of a

            (11)   The costs of providing governmental
services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair
of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges.



      E.   Conditions for Variance.



            (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new
construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level providing terms 2 through 7
below have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical jurisdiction required for issuing the variance
increases.



            (2)   Variances may be issued for the
reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this
section.



            (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result; consideration of the effects of any development on
flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of
development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.



            (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.



            (5)   In addition to the criteria for variances
set forth in Section 165.22(9) of this chapter, variances shall only be
issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of the variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.



            (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given a written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.



            (7)   All variances granted shall have the
concurrence or approval of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.



      20.   Nonconforming Uses.



         A.   Continuance of Nonconforming Uses.  A structure or
the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or
amendment of the ordinance codified in this section but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this section may be continued subject to
the following conditions:



            (1)   No such use or substantial improvement of
that use shall be expended, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.



            (2)   If such use is discontinued for six
consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to
this section.  The Utility Department shall notify the Building Inspector in
writing of instances of nonconforming uses where utility services have been
discontinued for a period of six months.



            (3)   Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become
nuisances shall not be entitled to continue any nonconforming uses.



         B.   Replacement of Residential Uses.  If any
residential nonconforming use of structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
The calculation of the cost of reconstruction does not include the cost of
any alteration to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary,
building, or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.



         C.   Replacement of Nonresidential Uses.  If any
nonresidential nonconforming use of structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it should not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
except that if it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this
section.  The calculation of the cost of reconstruction does not include the
cost of any alteration to comply with existing State or local health,
sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any
alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

165.17   SUPPLEMENTAL SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.



      1.   Purpose.  The Supplemental Site Development Regulations
establish basic requirements for developable lots, including frontage
requirements.  These regulations recognize the existence of special
conditions that cannot comply literally with the site development regulations
set out for each zoning district.  Therefore, these regulations qualify or
modify the district regulations of this chapter and provide for specific
areas of exception.



      2.   Required Street Frontage.  Any lot used in whole or part
for residential purposes shall provide a minimum frontage of 25 feet along at
least one public street.  There shall not be more than one single-family
housing unit for such frontage.  In order to satisfy this requirement, the
frontage along a public street must permit direct access to such street.



      3.   Lot Size Exceptions.  In any district permitting
residential use types, a single-family or duplex use type may be located on
any lot or plot of official record as of the effective date of this chapter,
regardless of its area or width, but subject to the following requirements:



         A.   The sum of the widths of the side yards of such lot
shall be the lesser of those required by the district regulations or 25% of
the width of the lot.  No single side yard shall be less than 10% of the
width of the lot.



         B.   The depth of the rear yard of such lot need not
exceed 20% of the depth of the lot, but shall not be less than 20 feet.



         C.   If two or more such adjacent lots are combined
under single ownership, the resulting combined lots shall be treated as a
single lot for purposes of applying these setback requirements.



      4.   Setback Adjustments.



         A.   Lots Adjoining Alleys.  In calculating the depth
of a required side or rear yard setback for a lot adjoining a dedicated
public alley, one-half of the alley may be credited as a portion of the
yard.  However, no residential structure may be nearer than five feet to the
near side of the alley.



         B.   Encroachments on Required Yards.  Every part of a
required yard shall be open and unobstructed from finished grade upward,
except as specified herein.



            (1)   Architectural projections, including roofs
which cover porches, enclosed porches, window sills, belt courses, cornices,
eaves, flues and chimneys and ornamental features may project three feet into
a required yard.



            (2)   Terraces, patios, uncovered decks, and
ornamental features which have no structural element more than two feet above
or below the adjacent ground level may project ten feet into a required
yard.  However, all such projections must be set back at least five feet
from an adjacent side lot line; or fifteen (15) feet from any street property
line.



            (3)   Fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways,
and balconies opening to fire towers may project a maximum of 3 feet into
required yards, provided that they do not obstruct the light and ventilation
of adjacent buildings.



            (4)   For buildings constructed upon a front
property line, a cornice may project into public right-of-way.  Maximum
projection is the smaller of four feet or five percent of the right-of-way
width.



            (5)   In commercial districts, a canopy may extend
into a required front yard, provided that the canopy is set back at least
five feet from the front property line, covers less than fifteen percent of
the area of the required front yard, and has a vertical clearance of at least
eight feet six inches.



            (6)   Accessory buildings are subject to all site
development regulations of its zoning district, except as provided below:



               a.   Side Yards:  An accessory building may
be located a minimum of five  feet from the side lot line of the property if
it is located between the rear building line of the principal building and
the rear property line.



               b.   Front Yards:  No accessory building
may be located between the front building line of the principal building and
the front property line.



               c.   Rear Yard:  The minimum rear yard
setback for accessory buildings shall be 5 feet.  This minimum rear yard
setback shall be increased to 15 feet if the accessory building requires
vehicular access from an alley.  Double-frontage lots shall require
front-yard setbacks along both street frontages as set forth in Table
165.09-3.  Easements may be incorporated into these required setbacks.  No
accessory building shall be located within any easement or right-of-way along
the rear property line.



               d.   Street Yards:  No accessory building
shall be located within 25 feet from any street right-of-way line.



               e.   Maximum Size of an Accessory Building
in a R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 or R-5 Residential District:



                  (1)   Shed.  No accessory building
other than a garage shall exceed 144 square feet, or 1.5% of total lot area,
whichever is larger.



                  (2)   Garage.  The maximum size of a
detached garage for single-family detached, single-family attached, or duplex
residential uses shall not exceed 1,080 square feet and shall not have a
dimension in excess of 40 feet on any one side, or 25% of the ground level
square footage of the primary residential structure, whichever is larger. 



                  (3)   Total Area.  All accessory
buildings on a site, taken together, must comply with the building coverage
requirements for the zoning district and shall not occupy more than 30% of
any rear yard.  This regulation shall not prohibit construction of a single
garage with coverage up to 550 square feet on a minimum rear yard, even if
such construction exceeds the 30% rear yard coverage restriction.



                  (4)   No Variances.  The Board of
Adjustment shall not grant a variance enlarging an accessory building in the
above districts.



                  (5)   Building Permit.  Construction
of any accessory building requires the owner to obtain a building permit
prior to commencing construction.



               f.   Height:  In residential districts, the
maximum height shall be 16 feet for any accessory building.  Maximum height
for a detached garage and/or other accessory building in an AR District shall

               k.   No accessory building shall be built
upon any lot until construction of the principal building has begun.



            (7)   Lamp posts with a maximum height of ten (10)
feet, and flag poles up to maximum height of base district may be located
within required yards, provided they are set back at least five (5) feet from
property lines.



            (8)   Garage Setbacks:  Any garage that fronts on
a public street must be set back at least 25 feet from such street,
regardless of the setback requirement within the zoning district.



         C.   Setback Adjustments.



            (1)   Setbacks on Built-Up Blockfaces.  These
provisions apply if thirty percent or more of the buildings on that blockface
have front yard setbacks different from those required for the specific
district.



               a.   If a building is to be built on a
parcel of land within 100 feet of existing buildings on both sides, the
minimum front yard shall be the mean setbacks of the adjacent buildings.



               b.   If a building is to be built on a
parcel of land within 100 feet of an existing building on one side only, the
minimum front yard shall be the setback of the adjacent building.



               c.   If a building is to be built on a
parcel of land not within 100 feet of an existing building on either side,
then the minimum front yard shall be the mean setback of all existing
buildings on the blockface.



               d.   No setback adjustment pursuant to this
section shall create a required front yard setback more than five feet
greater than that otherwise required by the applicable zoning district.



            (2)   Corner Lots.  Required setbacks shall not
reduce the buildable width of any corner lot to less than 24 feet. 
Appropriate setback adjustments shall be allowed to maintain this minimum
width.  There shall be a side yard on the longer street side of a reversed
frontage lot of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the front yard
required on the lots to the rear of such reversed frontage lot, and no
accessory building on said reversed frontage lot shall project beyond the
setback line of the lots in the year; provided that this regulation shall not
require a side yard greater than twenty-five (25) feet.



         D.   Rear Yard Exceptions – Residential Uses.  When
an irregular lot is used for residential purposes, the rear yard may be
measured as the average horizontal distance between the building and rear lot
line, provided that the minimum setback shall not be less than sixty percent
(60%) of the rear yard required by the zoning district.



         E.   Side Yard Setback Adjustments on Lots Platted
Before June 17, 1993.     On any lot platted before June 17, 1993, the
minimum side yard setback in any zoning district may be reduced to five feet
by the Board of Adjustment.



         F.   Double Frontage Lots.  Residentially zoned double
frontage lots on a major street, and with no access to that street may have a
25-foot minimum front yard setback along said street.  All other double
frontage lots must provide full front yard setbacks from each adjacent street.



         G.   Satellite Antennas.



            (1)   Each lot shall have no more than one
satellite antenna.



            (2)   Antennas with a surface area over 3.2 square
feet which are accessory to a primary use and are designed to receive and
transmit electromagnetic signals, or to receive signals from satellites,
shall not be located within any front yard of the primary use.



            (3)   Antennas with a surface area of over 3.2
square feet are subject to the following additional regulations:



               a.   Such antennas shall be located no less
than ten feet from the property line of an adjacent property line.



               b.   The maximum height shall be 15 feet and
the maximum diameter shall be 11 feet.



               c.   Each antenna shall be screened by a
six-foot high wood or masonry fence, or by natural plants or trees of equal
minimum height.



         H.   Vision Clearance Zones.  No structure, including a
fence, shall be built to a height of more than 30 inches above the
established curb grade on the part of the lot bounded by the right-of-way
lines of the streets which intersect and a line connecting a point on each of
such lines forty feet from their point of intersection.  No landscaping
shall be planted in such area which will materially obstruct the view of
drivers approaching the street intersection.



      5.   Height Exceptions.  These provisions allow exceptions to
the height limit of any zoning district in certain situations.



         A.   Vertical Projections.  Chimneys, cooling towers,
building mechanical equipment, elevator bulkheads, fire towers, grain
elevators, non-parabolic receiving antennas, tanks, solariums, steeples,
penthouses not exceeding 25 percent of total roof area, flag poles, stage
towers or scenery lofts, and water towers may be built to any height in
accordance with existing and future ordinances.



         B.   Amateur Radio Towers and Federal Communication
Commission Pronouncements.



            (1)   Radio towers, antennas and other
appurtenances operated by licensed amateur radio operators, where permitted
and when, may not exceed 75 feet in height.  This height has been determined
by the City to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, and
further represents the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish
legitimate municipal land use regulation purpose, as recognized under
published guidelines of the Federal Communications Commission.



            (2)   Special instances may require that amateur
radio tower heights exceed 75 feet to achieve effective and reliable
communications.  In such cases, the Board of Adjustment may grant a
Conditional  Use Permit to a licensed amateur radio operator for a specific
tower height that exceeds 75 feet.  In determining whether to grant such
permission, the City Council shall consider the federal guidelines contained
in PRB-1 Amateur Radio Preemption, 101 FCC 2d (1985); codified at C.F.R.
Section 97.15(e).



            (3)   Such radio towers shall not be located
within any front yard of the primary use.



         C.   Civic Buildings.  Buildings housing civic use
types may be built to a maximum height of 60 feet.  Such buildings located
in residential districts shall be set back one foot in addition to required
setbacks from each property line for each foot of height over the maximum
height of the zoning district.



         D.   Communications Towers.  Communications towers,
when operated by a federally licensed commercial or nonprofit organization,
may be built to any height in accordance with existing and future
ordinances.  This exception does not apply to radio towers, antennas and
other appurtenances operated by licensed amateur radio operators.  Such
towers are subject to the requirements of Section 165.16(9)(A) of this
chapter.



         E.   Wind Energy Conservation Systems (WECS).  Wind
Energy Conservation Systems are exempt from the height restrictions of the
base district but are subject to the regulations of Section 165.16(9)(B) of
this chapter.



         F.   Special Use Approvals.  The Board of Adjustment
may grant an exception from the height limit for a zoning district for a
special use as part of its approval of that use.  The limit or extent of
this exception shall be a specific part of the special use permit.



         G.   Federal Aviation Administration Rules.  No
structure may be built in any zoning district which exceeds the maximum
height permitted under the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
These rules describe the glide angles and operational patterns for any
airport within the planning jurisdiction of the City.



      6.   Exceptions to Site Development Regulations for Creative
Subdivisions.



         A.   Purpose.  In the instance that the Subdivision
Regulations provide for creative subdivisions, the City may authorize such
subdivisions to allow for greater flexibility in the design and development
of subdivisions, in order to produce innovative residential environments, to
provide for more efficient use of land, to protect topographic and to
encourage the preservation of common area and open space.  These special
regulations and design exceptions apply only to creative subdivisions.



         B.   Site Area Per Unit.  Unless otherwise provided,
the site area per unit for a creative subdivision as a whole shall be that of
the zoning district in which such subdivision is located.  For the purpose
of computing site area per unit, the area of public streets and private ways
within the subdivision must be excluded.  Residential use types may be
combined within the creative subdivision provided that the subdivision as a
whole complies with the required maximum density of the zoning district.



         C.   Perimeter Yards.



            (1)   Structures must maintain normal street yard
setbacks from any public streets that form the perimeter of the development.



            (2)   Structures must maintain a 20 foot minimum
side yard setback from any property line that forms the boundary of the
development.



         D.   Area and Yards for Individual Lots.



            (1)   Individual lots within a creative
subdivision are exempt from minimum lot area or yard setback requirements set
forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, unless provided for by the regulations for
a specific zoning district.  A creative subdivision must be planned and
developed as a common development.  A minimum separation of twenty (20) feet
shall be established for all residential structures not attached to one
another, unless the City Council grants a specific exception for developments
proposing unique circumstances, only in as much as said development can be
demonstrated to avoid detriment to Nevada’s efforts to protect public
health, safety, welfare, community character, property values and aesthetics.



            (2)   Any private garage oriented to or facing a
public street or private way internal to the creative subdivision must be set
back a minimum of 25 feet from that public street or private way.



         E.   Coverage and Landscaping Requirements.  Individual
lots in a creative subdivision are exempt from maximum building and
impervious coverage limitations and street yard landscaping requirements
established for the zoning district.  However, the subdivision as a whole,
including streets, walks, and access ways, must comply with the building and
impervious coverage regulations for its zoning district.



      7.   Fence Regulations.



         A.   Location Restriction.  Unless otherwise provided
by this chapter or other sections of this Code of Ordinances, no fence shall
be built on any lot or tract outside the surveyed lot lines.



         B.   Required Openings.  Unless otherwise provided by
this chapter or other sections of this Code of Ordinances, any fence built on
residential property within street side yards shall contain openings
constituting no less than 50 percent of the surface area of the fence.



         C.   Sight Obstruction.  No solid fence permitted or
required by this section or other sections of this Code of Ordinances shall
be built within a triangle formed by the adjacent right-of-way lines of two
intersecting streets and a line connecting points forty (40) feet on each leg
from their point of intersection; or otherwise in any manner create a traffic
hazard or obstruction to visibility.



         D.   Facing.  The finished surfaces of any fence shall
face toward adjacent properties and street frontage.



         E.   Residential Fences.  Fences constructed within
residential districts or on land used for residential purposes are subject to
the following provisions.



            (1)   A front yard fence shall:



               a.   Be decorative only and cannot be used
or intended as a means of confinement for humans, fowl or animals of any size
or type.



               b.   Be a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of
the total surface of the fence must be open an unobstructed.



               c.   Not exceed  thirty six (36) inches in

edge of the adjacent sidewalk, if any, and if there is no sidewalk, the
setback shall be twelve (12) inches from the front yard property line.



               e.   Split rail fences shall be allowed,
provided they do not exceed two horizontal rails.



               f.   Steel “guard rail” fences,
barricade fences, wire mesh or “chicken wire” fences, chain link fences,
farm style fences, lattice fences and all other fences of a similar nature
are strictly prohibited under all circumstances, regardless of height or type
of construction.



               g.   A decorative, neatly trimmed hedge not
exceeding 30 inches in height shall be allowed, provided it does not overhang
any adjacent sidewalk.



   This section is subject to corner sight triangle requirements of
paragraph C of this subsection.



            (2)   The maximum height for any fence outside of
a required front yard shall be six feet.



            (3)   Exception to Openness Requirement:  Fences
built on residential property outside of required street side yards may
exceed 50 percent closed construction.



            (4)   Exception for Front Yards of Double Frontage
Lots:  A fence built within the required front yard of a double frontage lot
may be a maximum of six feet in height and may exceed 50 percent closed
construction if such lot fronts an arterial street or expressway, as defined
in the Comprehensive Development Plan of the City of Nevada; and if such
frontage does not provide primary access to the property.



            (5)   Materials:  Fences shall be constructed of
wood, chain-link, PVC/ resin, stone or masonry materials only.  Use of scrap
wood or salvaged materials is not permitted in construction of a wood
fence.  Barbed wire and/or electrified fences are not permitted, and are
defined as any fence that includes in its material barbs, blades, razors,
electric current or other features specifically designed to injure or abrade
an individual or animal who attempts to negotiate the fence.



         F.   Civic, Office, Commercial, and Industrial Fences. 
Fences constructed in commercial and industrial districts are subject to the
following special provisions:



            (1)   The maximum height of a fence for any
permitted use in any non-residential zoning district shall be eight feet.



            (2)   Civic Uses in Residential Districts:  The
maximum height of fences installed as part of civic use types within
Residential Zoning Districts may be eight feet if approved by the Zoning
Administrator.



            (3)   The Board of Adjustment may approve greater
fence heights on a case-by-case basis if it concludes that such permission
furthers the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City.



            (4)   Barbed wire shall not be used in the
construction of any fence outside of the GI General Industrial Zoning
District.  Barbed wire may be used in the construction of fencing in an
industrial district provided that the bottom strand of the wire shall be at
least six feet above ground level.  Electrified fences are not permitted
within the jurisdiction of the City.



      8.   Appeals.  Denial, revocations, or cancellations of a
building permit based on the provisions of this section may be appealed to
the Board of Adjustment, as set forth in Sections 165.22(8) through (10).



165.18   LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.



   The Landscaping and Screening Regulations provide additional guidance
on the development of sites within Nevada by addressing landscaping and
screening requirements.  They are designed to improve the appearance of the
community, buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another and
conserve the value of properties within the City.



      1.   Applicability.  The provisions of this section apply to
all new development on each lot or site upon application for a building
permit, except for the following:



         A.   Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully
existing use or structure following a casualty loss.



         B.   Remodeling, rehabilitation, or improvements to
existing uses or structures which do not substantially change the location of
structures, parking or other site improvements.



         C.   Additions or enlargements of existing uses or
structures which increase floor area or impervious coverage area by less than
20 percent.  Where such additions or enlargements are 20 percent or greater,
these provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new development
occurs.



      2.   Landscaping Requirements.  Landscaping shall be required
adjacent to each street property line and within street yards as set forth in
Table 165.18-1.



      3.   Use of Inorganic Landscaping Materials.  No artificial
trees, shrubs, plants or turf shall be used to fulfill the minimum
requirements for landscaping.  Inorganic materials, such as stone or
decorative pavers, may be used provided that such material does not comprise
more than 35% of the minimum required landscaped area.  Other concrete
and/or asphalt pavement surfaces may not be used within the minimum required
landscaped area, except for driveways and walkways.

4.   Buffer Yard Provisions.  These provisions apply when a use is
established in a more intensive zoning district (District A) which is
adjacent to a less intensive zoning district (District B).  The owner,
developer, or operator of the use within District A shall install and
maintain a landscaped buffer yard on his/her lot or site, as set forth in
this section.  Buffer yard requirements apply only to those districts
indicated in Table 165.18-2.  Buffer yards are not required of
single-family, 2-family, duplex, or townhouse use types in the more intensive
zoning district.  The buffer yard dimensions set forth in Table 165.18-2
apply to zoning districts which share a common lot line or are adjacent but
separated by an intervening alley.

Notes to Table 165.18-2:

Note 1:  Applies only to residential uses previously established in the
zoning district.

Note 2:  Vertical screening only is required as set forth in subsection 5 of
this section.

Note 3:  Buffer requirements do not apply to single-family, duplex or
townhouse residential uses established in District A.




 



   When a street separates adjacent zoning districts requiring a buffer
yard, the size of the buffer yard shall be one-half the required buffer yard
set forth in Table 165.18-2.  Each required buffer yard must be entirely
landscaped and free of paved areas, access ways, storage, or other
disturbances.



      5.   Screening Standards.



         A.   Application.  Screening is required between
adjacent zoning districts indicated in Table 165.18-2 when one or more of the
following conditions in the more intensive zoning district is directly
visible from and faces toward the boundary of the less intensive zoning
district:



            (1)   The rear elevation of buildings.



            (2)   Outdoor storage areas or storage tanks,
unless otherwise screened.



            (3)   Loading docks refuse collection points, and
other service areas.



            (4)   Major machinery or areas housing a
manufacturing process.



            (5)   Major on-site traffic circulation areas or
truck and/or trailer parking.



            (6)   Sources of glare, noise, or other
environmental effects.



         B.   Opaque Barrier.  A six-foot opaque barrier shall
be provided which visually screens the conditions listed in paragraph A from
less intensive uses as follows:



            (1)   A solid wood and/or masonry fence or wall at
least six feet in height.



            (2)   A landscaping screen, using evergreen or
deciduous materials, capable of providing a substantially opaque, hedge-like
barrier and attaining a minimum height of six feet within three years of
planting.



            (3)   A landscaped earth berm with a maximum slope
of three to one, rising no less than six feet above the existing grade of the
lot line separating the zoning districts.



            (4)   Any combination of these methods that
achieves a cumulative height of six feet.



         C.   Location of Screening Wall.  A screening wall or
fence shall be installed no closer to the less intensive zoning district than
the lesser of 20 feet or one-half the width of the required buffer yard.



         D.   Screening:  Effect on Drainage.  Screening shall
not adversely affect surface water drainage.



         E.   Permitted Interruptions of Screening.  Screening
may be interrupted to provide access drives to service areas or for loading
purposes to buildings.  The total of breaks or interruptions shall not
exceed 20% of the length of the required screened area.  Individual breaks
shall not exceed thirty feet in width.



      6.   Tree Plantings.  In any landscaped area for commercial
uses only required by the minimum depth requirements, the buffer yard
requirements, or the parking lot interior landscaping requirements, one tree
of an approved species with a minimum caliper size of two inches shall be
planted and maintained for each 500 square feet of required landscaped
area.  Existing trees approved for preservation shall be counted toward
satisfaction of this requirement.



      7.   General Provisions.



         A.   Time of Application.  The provisions contained in
this section shall be applied for each individual lot or site when an
application for a building permit on such lot is made.  When required, a
landscape plan shall be submitted with each application for a building
permit.  Such plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator for
compliance with the provisions of this section.



         B.   Maintenance of Required Landscaping.  Upon
installation of required landscape materials, each owner shall take
appropriate actions to ensure their continued health and maintenance. 
Required landscaping that does not remain healthy shall be replaced
consistent with this section.



         C.   Obstruction of View.  Landscaping or screening
installed in any landscaped area shall not obstruct the view from or to any
driveway approach, street, alley or sidewalk.



         D.   Earth Berm Locations.  All earth berm locations
shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator to determine how the berms
shall relate to drainage and public utilities.



         E.   Exceptions.  A development may continue to comply
with the buffer yard and screening requirements in effect at the time of
issuance of its original permit, regardless of whether an adjacent lot or
site is subsequently rezoned to a less intensive district which would
otherwise require compliance with buffer yard or screening provisions.



165.19   OFF-STREET PARKING.



   The Off-Street Parking Regulations require that developments provide
parking in proportion to the need created by each use.  The regulations
further establish standards for the functional design of parking
facilities.  These regulations are intended to accommodate vehicles in a
functionally satisfactory manner and to minimize external effects on
neighboring properties.



      1.   General Applications and Exemptions.  Off-street parking
shall be provided for any new building constructed, for new uses or
conversions of existing buildings, or for enlargements of existing
structures.  Any use within the DC Downtown Commercial District other than
Downtown Residential is exempt from the off-street parking requirements
provided by subsection 2 below.  Any off-street parking facility constructed
in the DC District after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance must
comply with the design standards set forth in this section.



      2.   Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements.  Parking
facilities for each use shall be provided in accord with the minimum
requirements set forth in Table 165.19-1.



         A.   When a computation of required parking results in a
fraction of 0.5 or greater, the requirement shall be rounded up to the next
whole number.



         B.   Unless otherwise indicated, parking requirements
are based on gross floor area.  Gross floor areas for the purpose of this
calculation exclude any interior space used for the parking or loading of
vehicles.



         C.   When parking requirements are computed on the basis
of capacity, capacity shall be determined by the building code or other
official determinations of occupancy in effect for the City of Nevada at the
time the use is established.

         A.   Residential Parking. 



            (1)   Off-street parking for residential uses
shall be located on the same lot or site as the use.



            (2)   Off-street parking areas for any
multi-family residential uses shall be at least six feet from any main
building; and shall not be located within a required front yard or street
side yard.



            (3)   For multi-family residential uses,
separately leased, detached garages may not be used to satisfy parking
requirements for such uses, parking incorporated into the design of
multi-family buildings, or within parking structures, shall be counted toward
fulfillment of parking requirements.



         B.   Nonresidential Parking.  Off-street parking for
nonresidential uses shall be located on the same lot or site as the use, or
within 300 feet of that use if the parking site is within a zoning district

to provide for a vehicle overhang area.  The vehicle overhang area may not
encroach into a required landscaped area or public sidewalk.



            (3)   Spaces designated for the persons with
disabilities shall have a minimum width of 12 feet.  Each accessible space
shall provide a barrier free route to an accessible building entrance, which
shall not require users to walk or wheel behind parked cars.  Such spaces
shall be designated with an upright sign exhibiting the universal symbol for
accessibility by the persons with disabilities.  All such spaces shall be
designed in compliance with the standards of Chapter 321L of the Iowa Code.



         B.   Pavement and Drainage.

            (2)   Off-street parking facilities shall be
designed and built to prevent the free flow of water onto adjacent properties
or public rights-of-way.



         C.   Landscape and Screening Requirements.  Unless
otherwise noted, each unenclosed parking facility of over 3,000 square feet
shall comply with the following regulations:



            (1)   Each unenclosed parking facility shall
provide a minimum landscaped buffer of ten feet along any street property
line.



            (2)   Each parking facility that abuts a
residential district shall provide a ten foot landscaped buffer along its
common property line with the residential district.



            (3)   Any parking facility which abuts property in
a residential district shall provide a fence, wall, landscape screen, or
earth berm not less than four feet in height for the length of the common
boundary.  A grade change, terrace, or other site feature which blocks the
sight line of headlights into a residential property may satisfy this
requirement, subject to the determination of the Building Official.



            (4)   Each unenclosed parking facility of over
4,500 square feet within a street yard shall provide an interior landscaped
area equal to no less than 5 percent of the total paved area of the parking
facility.  Parking facilities within the GI District shall be exempt from
this requirement.



            (5)   Interior landscaping shall be credited
toward the satisfaction of overall landscaping requirements set forth in
Section 165.18.



            (6)   Landscaping or screening installed in any
required landscaped area shall not obstruct the view to or from the
off-street parking facility to any driveway approach, street, alley, or
sidewalk.  Landscaping shall further not obstruct any views among parking
spaces and circulation ways, or visibility between vehicles and pedestrians.



         D.   Entrances and Exits.



            (1)   Adequate access to each parking facility
shall be provided by means of clearly defined and limited driveways or access
points.  Such driveways shall be designed to direct non-residential traffic
away from residential areas.



            (2)   Parking facilities other than driveways for
single-family, duplex, two-family, or mobile home residential uses must
permit vehicles to enter streets in a forward position.



            E.   Safety Features.



            (1)   Parking facilities shall be designed to
provide visibility of and between pedestrians and vehicles when circulating
within or entering or leaving the facility; and shall not create blind,
hidden, or hazardous areas.



            (2)   Circulation patterns shall be designed in
accordance with accepted standards of traffic engineering and safety.



            (3)   Parking facilities shall be adequately
illuminated and shall provide a minimum level of illumination of 1
foot-candle at a height of six feet above grade.



            F.   Maintenance.  All parking facilities shall
be maintained to assure the continued usefulness and compatibility of the
facility.  Acceptable maintenance includes keeping the facility free of
refuse, debris, and litter; maintaining parking surfaces in sound condition;
and providing proper care of landscaped areas.



            G.   Adjustment.  For uses subject to a special
use permit approval, the Planning and Zoning Commission may adjust the
minimum requirements of this section, in order to provide design, usability,
attractiveness, or protection to adjoining uses in a manner equal to or
greater than the minimum requirements of this section.

residential zoning districts.



      9.   Limited Recreational Vehicle Parking Exception. 
Individuals or single families may reside in a recreational vehicle (RV) in
good repair for up to six continuous months provided at least one of the
adult occupants of the RV is employed full-time in the construction of a
structure being built for the benefit and use of a governmental or charitable
institution; and provided further that the employment is donated free of
charge to the institution, or at a rate that is substantially lower than
customary wages for similar work in the community.



         A.   The RV shall be located within close proximity to
the actual work site.



         B.   The institution, at its expense, shall furnish
metered City water and sewer services to the individual RV and the
institution shall be responsible for payment of the monthly charge for City
water and sewer services.



         C.   No more than three RV’s shall be allowed on each
construction site.

         E.   The occupants and the institution shall keep the
area neat, sanitary and uncluttered and shall not allow the accumulation of
junk, refuse or garbage on the premises.



   An institution that seeks to avail itself of the benefits of this
exception shall make a written request in letter form addressed to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for a Special RV Parking Permit, demonstrating
its compliance with the above provisions, accompanied by an application fee
for each RV unit.  (The amount of the fee may be found in the Appendix to
this Code of Ordinances.)  The request and fee shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
consider the request at the next regular meeting and shall have sole
discretion to grant or reject the application.  Permits shall expire in six
months, but in the event the construction project is not completed by the
expiration of the permit, the Planning and Zoning Commission may extend the
permit for not more than two additional six-month periods.  In any event,
all permits shall expire ten days after a Certificate of Occupancy is issued
for the building being constructed.  A permit or permits may be revoked at
any time by the Commission for a violation of the provisions of this
subsection or any additional reasonable rules promulgated by the Commission
or the Zoning Enforcement Officer and noted on the permit or issued in

Notes to Table 165.20-4



   Note 1:   In addition to its total permitted sign area, each
premises used for a business center may have one detached center
identification sign, subject to the following conditions:



      1.   The maximum area for a center identification sign shall
be 150 square feet.



      2.   No center identification sign shall be within 300 feet of
any other center identification sign or within 150 feet of any other detached
sign on the same or adjacent premises.



      3.   The sign shall display no more than the name and location
of the business center.



      4.   Each sign shall be subject to all other regulations for
detached signs or graphics set forth in this section.



165.21   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND LAND USES. 



      1.   Purpose.  The purposes of these regulations are:



         A.   To allow for reasonable use of legally created lots
of record which do not meet current minimum requirements for their respective
zoning districts.



         B.   To provide for reasonable use of legally
constructed structures which do not meet current site development regulations
for their respective zoning districts.



         C.   To allow for the reasonable continuation of legally
established uses which do not meet current use regulations for their
respective zoning districts.



         D.   To limit the continuation and provide for the
gradual replacement of nonconforming uses.



      2.   Regulations Additive.  Regulations for nonconforming
uses are in addition to regulations for nonconforming structures.  In the
event of a conflict, the most restrictive regulation shall apply.



      3.   Nonconforming Lots.



         A.   Pre-Existing Lots of Record.  Nonconforming lots
of record existing at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance shall
be exempt, unless otherwise provided, from the minimum lot area and lot width
requirements of each zoning district.  Such lots may be developed with any
use allowed by the regulations for the district and must comply with all
other site development regulations set forth by the Zoning Ordinance, except
as provided by Section 165.17(3).



         B.   Reductions Due to Public Acquisition.  If a
portion of a legally existing lot in any district is acquired for public use,
the remainder of this lot shall be considered a conforming lot.



      4.   Nonconforming Structures.  These regulations apply to
buildings and structures which were constructed legally under regulations in
effect before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.



         A.   Continuation.  A lawful nonconforming structure
existing on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued,
repaired, maintained or altered, subject to the provisions of this section.



         B.   Additions or Enlargements to Nonconforming
Structures.



            (1)   A lawful nonconforming structure may be
added to or enlarged if the addition satisfies one or more of the following
conditions:



               a.   The enlargement or addition, when
considered independently of the existing building, complies with all
applicable setback, height, off-street parking, and landscaping requirements.



               b.   The addition projects no further into a
required side yard setback than the existing building; the length of the side
wall of the addition is the smaller of 25 feet or 50 percent of the length of
the existing nonconforming side wall; and the enlarged building complies with
building and impervious coverage, front and rear yard setbacks, and height
regulations applicable to its zoning district.



            (2)   No permitted addition to a nonconforming
structure may place a wall within ten feet of a window of an adjacent
pre-existing residential structure.



            (3)   Nonconforming buildings shall be limited to
one addition or enlargement pursuant to these regulations.



         C.   Moving of Nonconforming Structures.  A lawful
nonconforming building or structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to
another location on its lot unless every part of the structure conforms to
all site development regulations applicable to its zoning district.



         D.   Repair of Nonconforming Structures.  If damage
caused to a lawful nonconforming structure by fire, explosion, storm or other
calamity, except flood damages, exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of the
structure, such structure may not be repaired and/or reconstructed . 
Permitted repair or reconstruction shall not increase in the degree of
nonconformity.  Repair and reconstruction within the designated floodplain
shall be in conformance with Floodplain development regulations.



         E.   Conversion of a Conforming Building.  A conforming
building shall not be changed in any way that will result in a nonconforming
development.



         F.   Applicability of Landscaping and Screening
Regulations.  A pre-existing structure, building or development shall be
exempt from Section 165.18, Landscaping and Screening Regulations.  However,
any expansion of such structure, building, or development or any adjacent new
development onto property that is or becomes vacant on or after the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be subject to Section 165.18.



      5.   Nonconforming Uses.



         A.   Continuation of Nonconforming Uses.  Any
nonconforming use lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance may continue, subject to the limitations of this section.



         B.   Enlargement of Nonconforming Uses.  A building or
structure housing a lawful nonconforming use may not be added to or enlarged.



         C.   Abandonment of Nonconforming Use.  If any
structure or property used as a lawful nonconforming use becomes vacant or
unused for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, any subsequent use must
conform to all use regulations applicable to the property’s zoning district.



         D.   Change of Use.  A lawful nonconforming use may be
changed only to a use type permitted in a zoning district that is equal to or
less intensive than that normally required for the previous use.



         E.   Allowance for Repairs.  Repairs and maintenance of
a structure occupied by a nonconforming use may be made, provided that no
structural alterations are made other than those required by law.



         F.   Damage or Destruction of Structures.  Should a
structure occupied by a lawful nonconforming use be damaged to the extent
that the cost of restoration exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost of
the structure, the nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted.



         G.   Nonconforming Uses and Conditional Use Permits.  A
lawful pre-existing use which would require a conditional use permit in its
zoning district shall be presumed to have the appropriate permit and shall be
considered a conforming use.  The use shall be subject to the regulations
governing lapses or revocation of permits set forth in Section 165.22 and in
the following subsection.



         H.   Owner Initiated Zoning Changes.  Where a
nonconforming use arises as a result of an owner initiated zoning change, no
nonconforming use shall be allowed to continue absent a variance granted by
the Board of Adjustment after notice and hearing. 



165.22   ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES.



      1.   Purpose.  The Administration and Procedures Provisions
establish the methods for implementation of the Zoning Ordinance.  These
provisions include procedures for reviewing specific uses within certain
zoning districts, amending the Zoning Ordinance and granting variances.



      2.   Site Plan Review Procedure.  The Site Plan Review
Procedure provides for the administrative review in addition to plan review
required by other sections of this Code of Ordinances of projects that have
potentially significant effects on traffic circulation or a significant
effect on land uses in adjacent neighborhoods.  The procedure provides for
review and evaluation of site development features and possible mitigation of
unfavorable effects on surrounding property.  This review supplements and
does not replace any existing reviews or approvals required under this or
other ordinances.



         A.   Administration.  The Zoning Administrator shall
review, evaluate and act on all site plans submitted pursuant to this
procedure.  An applicant may appeal a denial of any application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission. 



         B.   Uses Requiring Site Plan Review.  The following
selected uses shall follow the Site Plan review procedure prior to the
issuance of a building permit, unless they are otherwise subject to a special
permit procedure for specific zoning districts.



            (1)   Multiple family developments with 3 or more
dwelling units on a single lot; or including  more than one residential
building.



            (2)   Education Facilities.



            (3)   Health Care facilities.



            (4)   Any use containing a public assembly space
with a rated occupancy capacity of 50 or more people.



            (5)   Any commercial, industrial, or office
building.



            (6)   Parking Facilities.



         C.   Pre-Application Conference.  For any use requiring
site plan review, the owners of the property or the owners’ authorized
agent shall request a pre-application conference, which shall include the
applicant or the applicant’s representative and City staff. 



            (1)   The purpose of the conference shall be to
acquaint the city staff with the proposed development and to acquaint the
applicant with the procedures and with any special problems that might relate
to the proposed development.



            (2)   The applicant shall furnish a legal
description of the property to be developed at the time of requesting the
conference.  The conference shall be held within 15 working days of the
request.



            (3)   For the purpose of this section, development
is defined to be the placement of buildings and other structures, paved
areas, drainage and utility improvements, lighting, and other appurtenances
related to any use requiring Site Plan Review.



         D.   Application Requirements.  An application for a
Site Plan Review may be filed by the owners of a property or the owners’
authorized agent with the Zoning Administrator.  The application shall
include the following information:



            (1)   Name and address of the applicant and
developer/builder; and the name of the proposed development or use.



            (2)   Owner, address, and legal description of the
property.



            (3)   Site information, including site area and
present and proposed zoning.



            (4)   A narrative description of the nature and
operating characteristics of the proposed use.



            (5)   Existing trees with a caliper of 6 inches
and over, measured three feet above grade.



            (6)   A site plan, drawn to a scale sufficient to
permit adequate review and dimensioned as necessary, showing the following

Procedure provides for Planning and Zoning Commission review and approval of
uses within zoning districts which have unusual site development or operating
characteristics that could adversely affect surrounding properties.  Uses
which require special use permits are considered to be uses permitted within
their respective zoning districts depending on the nature and design of their
development and operating characteristics and subject to careful review in
relation to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive
Plan.  They are not considered to be special exception uses as set forth by
the Code of Iowa.



         A.   Administration.  The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall review, evaluate, and act upon all applications submitted
pursuant to this procedure.

established in Table 165.22-1 and conformance with applicable regulations in
this Zoning Ordinance.



         E.   Scope of Planning and Zoning Commission Approval. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission may, at its discretion, apply a special
use permit to a specific owner or applicant.  The Commission may establish
special site development or operational regulations as a condition for
approval of a special use permit.  The Commission shall not grant a special
use permit for any home occupation/home-based business which is otherwise
prohibited under Section 165.16(10) of this chapter.



         F.   Lapse and Revocation of Permit.  A special use
permit shall become void two years after its effective date if the applicant
has not carried out development or occupancy during that period, or sooner if

permit should the operation of the use subject to such permit violate the
conditions under which the permit was granted.



         G.   Appeal of Denials of Special Use Permits.  Denial
of a special use permit may be appealed to the City Council.

the City and the present use of the land.



      6.   Building Permits and Certificates of Zoning Compliance.



         A.   Administration and Enforcement.  The Zoning
Administrator shall administer and enforce this chapter.  The City Council
may direct other persons to assist the Zoning Administrator.  If the Zoning
Administrator finds that any of the provisions of this chapter are being
violated, he/she shall notify in writing the person responsible for such
violations, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action
necessary to correct it.  The Zoning Administrator shall order
discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal of
illegal buildings or structures or of illegal additions, alterations or
structural changes; or discontinuance of any illegal work being done; and
shall take any action authorized by this chapter or State and local statutes
and ordinances to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of its
provisions.



         B.   Building Permits Required.  No building or other

Adjustment in the form of an administrative review, special exception or
variance as provided by this chapter.



         C.   Application for Building Permit.



            (1)   All applications for building permits shall
include plans if applicable in triplicate drawn to an appropriate scale,

         D.   Posting of Building Permits.  A building permit
shall be posted by the applicant on the property in question prior to the

this chapter and the Code of Iowa.  Meetings shall be held at the call of
the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine.  Such
Chairperson, or in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chair, may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.  All meetings and
records shall be open to the public.  The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent
or failing to vote, indicating such fact.  The Board shall keep a record of
its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.

transaction of business.



         B.   Procedure for Appeals.



            (1)   Appeals shall be made to the Board of
Adjustment through the office of the Zoning Administrator in written form as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.  The Board shall fix a reasonable
time for the hearing of the appeal and shall decide the appeal within 30 days
of the date of the public hearing.  An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.



            (2)   The Board shall provide a minimum of four
(4) days and a maximum of twenty (20) days notice of a public hearing on any
question before it.  Notice of the hearing shall be by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City of Nevada; and by certified mail
to the appealing party.



            (3)   Upon the public hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or attorney.  The concurring vote of three out
of five members of such board as so composed shall be necessary to reverse
any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under any zoning ordinance, or to effect any
variation in such ordinance.



            (4)   An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board that a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent
danger to life, property, or the public safety.  In such a case, the
proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator.



      9.   Powers and Duties of the Board of Adjustment.  The Board
of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:



         A.   Administrative Review.  To hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decisions or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this
Ordinance or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of
structures.



         B.   Appeals to Interpretation of Zoning Map.  To hear
and decide any appeals from the interpretations of the zoning map by the
Zoning Administrator.



         C.   Variances to Relieve Hardships Relating to
Property.  To authorize, upon appeal, variances from the strict application
of this Zoning Ordinance where by reason of exceptional narrowness,
shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment
of the zoning regulations; or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions
or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece
of property, such strict application would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner
of such property.



            (1)   Requirements for Grant of a Variance.  No
such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds that:



               a.   Strict application of the Zoning
Ordinance will produce undue hardship and would deprive the applicant of
rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the
terms of this chapter.



               b.   Such hardship is not shared generally
by other properties in the same zoning district and in the same vicinity.



               c.   The authorization of such variance will
not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the
district will not be changed by the granting of the variance.



               d.   The granting of such variance is based
upon reason of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from
variations for purposes of convenience, profit or caprice.



               e.   The condition or situation of the
property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make
reasonably practicable a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to
this Zoning Ordinance.



               f.   The granting of the variance will not
cause substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially
impair the intent and purpose of any Ordinance or Resolution.



            (2)   Findings by Board.  The Board of Adjustment
shall make findings that the requirements of paragraph (9)(D) of this section
have been met by the applicant for a variance.



      D.   Conditions for Grant of Variance.



            (1)   In granting any variance, the Board of
Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this chapter.  Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.



            (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of
Adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of
this chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.



            (3)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall
be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.



         E.   Board has Powers of Zoning Administrator on
Appeals; Reversing Decisions of Zoning Administrator.  In exercising the
above mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action
is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decisions or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of
the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken.  The concurring vote
of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirements, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in the application of
this chapter.



      10.   Board of Adjustment: Review by City Council.  The City
Council may provide for review of variances granted by the Board of
Adjustment before their effective date.  The Council may remand a decision
to grant a variance to the Board of Adjustment for further study.  The
effective date of the variance is delayed for thirty days from the date of
the remand.



      11.   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment.  Any person or
persons, or any board, taxpayer, officer, department, board or bureau of the
City aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek review of
such decision by a court of record in the manner provided by the laws of the
State and particularly by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.



      12.   Severability Clause.  Should any section or provision
of this resolution be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the resolution as a
whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be
unconstitutional or invalid.



      13.   Complaints Regarding Violations.  Whenever a violation
of this chapter occurs, or is allowed to have occurred, any person may file a
written complaint.  Such complaints stating fully the causes and basis
thereof shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning
Administrator shall record properly such complaint, and investigate and take
action thereon within ten working days as provided by this chapter.



      14.   Penalties for Violation.  Violations of the provisions

shall constitute a misdemeanor or a municipal infraction, at the election of
the City.  The City may take any actions available to it under the Code of
Iowa to ensure compliance with these regulations, including prosecution of
such violation.  An owner, developer or subdivider of property may each be
found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided. 
Notwithstanding this section, the City and the Zoning Administrator shall
have the right to take any lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation of this chapter or any agreement pursuant to or other condition of
an approval of a subdivision application.



166.10   INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT. 



   This chapter shall be held to provide the minimum requirements
necessary for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare.  If
any provision of this chapter conflicts with any other provision of this Code
of Ordinances or any applicable State or Federal law, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.  Nothing in these provisions shall relieve any
property owner or user from satisfying any condition or requirement
associated with a previous approval, special permit, variance, development
permit or other permit issued under any local, State or Federal ordinance or
statute.



166.11   PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION. 



   The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for subdivision
applications and for review and action on applications by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the City Council.  The procedures are designed to
assure adequate review and consideration of subdivision applications, while
providing for an orderly and expeditious approval process.  This section
provides procedures for the approval of three types of subdivisions: 
Administrative Subdivisions, Minor Subdivisions and Major Subdivisions.



      1.   Administrative Subdivisions. 



         A.   Scope.  The Administrative Subdivision procedure
may be used to adjust an interior lot line or combine two or more lots,
providing the following conditions are met:



            (1)   In the case of an Administrative Lot Line
Adjustment:



               a.   The lots involved must be designated
within the same zoning district and the proposed adjustment will not create
or result in a violation of the Zoning Ordinance.



               b.   The lots involved must be existing
platted lots.



               c.   The adjustment alters lot lines of no
more than four lots without creating additional lots.



            (2)   In the case of an Administrative Platting or
Lot Consolidation:



               a.   The lots involved must be designated
within the same zoning district and the proposed platting or lot
consolidation will not create or result in a violation of the Zoning
Ordinance.



               b.   The lots involved must be existing
platted lots.



               c.   The lots must be under unified
ownership.



            (3)   A lot is limited to only one instance of an
administrative adjustment, platting and/or consolidation.



            (4)   The subdivision is served by existing
utilities and does not require the extension of or improvement to streets,
utilities or public improvements.



            (5)   Each lot resulting from the subdivision
procedure will conform fully to all requirements of the zoning district that
pertain to the lots; and each lot is developable according to the site
development regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.



            (6)   Street right-of-way has previously been
dedicated.



         B.   Application and Approval Procedure.  An
application for an Administrative Subdivision may be approved under the
following procedure:



            (1)   The applicant submits an application on a
form established by the Planning and Zoning Commission and including the
supporting documents required for Administrative Subdivisions in Table
166.11-1.  These documents shall include a plat of all lots and parcels that
are affected by the action, prepared by an Iowa Licensed Surveyor.



            (2)   Following submission, the Zoning
Administrator and City Engineer shall review each application according to
the following criteria:



               a.   Compliance with the conditions
contained in 166.11(1)(A) above.



               b.   Consistency with the Comprehensive
Development Plan of the City.



               c.   Potential adverse environmental effects
or effects on neighboring properties.



            (3)   Following such review, the Zoning
Administrator may approve the Administrative Subdivision.  Such approval
shall be marked on the plat and filed with the Story County Recorder.



            (4)   The Zoning Administrator retains the right
to disapprove or not act on the Administrative Subdivision application.  In
the event of such action, the application may proceed through the Minor or
Major Subdivision process.  If the subdivision complies with the conditions
of a Minor Subdivision application, it may be directed to that approval
process.  Otherwise, the proposed subdivision shall be deemed a Major
Subdivision and proceed through the appropriate review and action process.



            (5)   Following approval of an Administrative
Subdivision, the subdivider must file the plat and certificate of approval
with the Story County Recorder.  If the approved plat is not filed within
ten (10) days of approval by the Zoning Administrator, such approval shall be
null and void.



            (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall keep a
complete and accurate record of all administrative subdivision approvals.



      2.   Minor Subdivisions.



         A.   Scope.  The Minor Subdivision procedure may be
used when a proposed subdivision meets all of the following conditions:



            (1)   The subdivision adjusts the lot lines of no
more than four lots without creating additional lots; or creates no more than
four lots from any single parcel, tract or lot.



            (2)   The subdivision is served by existing
utilities and does not require the extension of or improvement to streets,
utilities or public improvements.



            (3)   Each lot resulting from the subdivision
procedure will conform fully to all requirements of the zoning district that
pertain to the lots; and each lot is developable according to the site
development regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.



            (4)   No part of the parcel has been the subject
of a previous Administrative Subdivision or Minor Subdivision approval.



         B.   Application and Approval Procedure.  An
application for a Minor Subdivision may be approved under the following
procedure:



            (1)   The applicant submits an application on a
form established by the Zoning Administrator and including the supporting
documents required for Administrative Subdivisions in Table 166.11-1.  These
documents shall include a plat of all lots and parcels that are affected by
the action, prepared by an Iowa Licensed Surveyor.



            (2)   Following submission, the Zoning
Administrator and City Engineer shall review each application according to
the following criteria:



               a.   Compliance with the conditions
contained in 166.11(2)(A) above.



               b.   Consistency with the Comprehensive
Development Plan.



               c.   Potential adverse environmental effects
or effects on neighboring properties.



               d.   Effects of the subdivision on public
services.  In order to determine this effect, the Zoning Administrator may
submit the application to relevant school districts, utilities and public
safety agencies as required.



            (3)   Following such review, the Zoning
Administrator shall forward the application, along with his/her
recommendation, to the Planning and Zoning Commission.



            (4)   The Commission shall take action on the
application.  If the subdivision is approved by the Commission, they shall
recommend approval to the City Council whose approval shall be documented by
a resolution and filed as stated in paragraph 166.11(3)(F) of this chapter.



            (5)   The Planning and Zoning Commission retains
the right to disapprove or not act on the Minor Subdivision application.  In
the event of such action, the application may proceed through the Major
Subdivision process.



            (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall keep a
complete and accurate record of all Minor Subdivision approvals.



      3.   Major Subdivisions.



         A.   Applicability.  The Major Subdivision procedures
apply to all subdivisions which are not approved or eligible for approval
under the Administrative or Minor Subdivision procedures.  In general, these
include subdivisions that:  (i) are not approved under the Administrative or
Minor Subdivision procedure; (ii) create more than four lots; (iii) require
development or extension of public improvements; or (iv) Require right-of-way
and public utility easement dedication.



         B.   Stages in the Approval Process.  The approval
process for Major Subdivisions consists of three stages:  the
pre-application stage, the preliminary plat approval stage, and the final
plat approval stage.



         C.   Pre-application Procedures.



            (1)   Before filing an application for preliminary
plat approval, the applicant shall meet with the Zoning Administrator
regarding general requirements and issues relating to the proposed
subdivision.



            (2)   At the pre-application conference, the
applicant shall submit a concept plan.  The concept plan shall include:



               a.   A location map showing the relationship
of the proposed subdivision to existing and proposed streets and public
facilities.



               b.   A schematic plan illustrating the
proposed layout of streets, lots and other features and their relationship to
existing and proposed site topography.



            (3)   Within fifteen working days, the Zoning
Administrator shall inform the applicant about the consistency of the concept
plan with the objectives and policies of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and
Land Development Ordinances.



            (4)   The pre-application conference does not
require a formal application or payment of a fee.



         D.   Preliminary Plat Application.



            (1)   Application Requirements.  After the
pre-application conference, the applicant shall prepare and submit an
application for preliminary plat approval.  The applicant shall prepare and
file 15 copies of a proposed preliminary plat.  The application for
preliminary plat approval shall be submitted to the City Clerk at least 45
calendar days before the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which the
application may be considered.  The application shall consist of a form
established by the Zoning Administrator; the supporting documents required
for Major Subdivisions in Table 166.11-1; and payment of a fee, the amount of
which shall be determined by the City Council.



            (2)   Draft Subdivision Agreement.  The
preliminary plat application shall include a draft of a subdivision
agreement, following a format established by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.  The subdivision agreement establishes the mutual
responsibilities of City and subdivider, including financing of public
improvements; the nature of performance bonds and guarantees that the
developer will offer; and the financing arrangements proposed for the
subdivision.



            (3)   Preliminary Plat Approval Procedure.



               a.   After submission of a complete
application for a preliminary plat, the Zoning Administrator and his/her
staff shall review the application.  As part of the review, the Zoning
Administrator will circulate the application to the City Engineer and any
other applicable provider of public services deemed necessary.  Each
reviewing agency shall submit written comments to the Zoning Administrator
within a period which the Zoning Administrator establishes.



               b.   Following the comment period, the
Zoning Administrator shall submit a written recommendation for action to the
Commission.



               c.   The Commission shall take action on the
application.  The Commission may recommend approval, conditional approval or
denial of the preliminary plat to the City Council.  In addition, the
Commission may delay action on the application in order to resolve
outstanding issues.



               d.   Following action by the Commission, the
Commission shall transmit a written recommendation summarizing the
Commission’s action to the City Council.



               e.   The City Council shall take action on
the application.



               f.   Approval of a preliminary plat by the
City Council shall not constitute approval of a final plat.  The approval
shall be considered an expression of conditional approval to guide the
preparation of a final plat, to be considered subsequently by approving
authorities.  The preliminary approval shall confer upon the applicant the
following rights: 



                  (i)   The general terms and conditions
under which the plat was approved will not change.



                  (ii)   The applicant may submit for
approval a final plat for the whole or a part of the preliminary plat on or
before the expiration date of the preliminary approval.



                  (iii)   The preliminary plat approval
shall stay in force for a period of one year from the date of approval by the
City Council.  The City Council may, at its discretion, establish a longer
effective date for the preliminary plat approval.  The City Council also may
grant extensions to the effective period of a preliminary plat.



                  (iv)   Phased Subdivisions:  The
final plat may be submitted in phases, provided that no phase represents the
lesser of 10 lots or 20% of the total number of lots in the entire approved
preliminary plat.  The initial phase of the final plat must be submitted
according to the effective dates established in paragraph (iii) above.  In
the event of a phased subdivision, the initial preliminary plat approval
remains effective for a period not to exceed five years, unless otherwise
extended by the City Council.



         E.   Final Plat Application Process.



            (1)   Application Requirements.  The applicant
shall prepare and submit an application for final plat approval within one
year of the preliminary plat approval, unless an extension has been granted
by the City Council.  The application for final plat approval shall be
submitted to the City Clerk at least 21 calendar days before the Planning and
Zoning Commission meeting at which the application will be considered.  The
application shall consist of a form established by the Zoning Administrator;
the supporting documents required for Final Plat Approval of Major
Subdivisions in Table 166.11-1; and payment of a fee, the amount of which
shall be determined by the City Council.



            (2)   Final Subdivision Development Agreement. 
The final plat application shall include the final Subdivision Development
Agreement to be executed between the City and the applicant.  This agreement
establishes the responsibilities of the subdivider and the responsibilities
of the City in the completion of the subdivision, including construction of
public improvements, a timetable for completion of public improvements by the
developer, and a maintenance bond in accordance with City requirements.  It
shall be submitted by the subdivider following a form of agreement
established by the City.  The terms of this agreement shall be acted upon
along with action on the final plat.



            (3)   Performance Bond.  The subdivision
agreement shall specify the amount of the performance bond for public
improvements to be filed prior to receiving final plat approval or,
alternately, shall contain a statement that required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed.  The performance bond, if required, must be
presented in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney prior to final approval
of the subdivision.



            (4)   Final Plat Approval.



               a.   The Zoning Administrator and Commission
shall review the final plat for consistency with the approved preliminary
plat and for compliance with the Land Development Ordinances and other
applicable local, State or Federal statutes and regulations.  If the final
plat meets all conditions of this chapter and is substantially consistent
with the terms of the preliminary plat approval, the Commission shall approve
the final plat.



               b.   If the Commission finds in its review
that the submitted final plat is inconsistent with the preliminary plat, does
not comply with the conditions of relevant ordinances and statutes, or
requires a waiver of any section of this chapter, the Commission shall
transmit its recommendation on the final plat to the City Council.



               c.   The City Council shall take final
action on the application.  The Council is further empowered to grant
waivers of a section of this chapter after the waiver request has received
approval from the Commission.



         F.   Filing the Final Plat.



            (1)   Following Council approval of a final plat
by resolution, the Mayor and the City Clerk shall certify a copy of the
resolution, which shall be a part of the reproducible documents of the
subdivision plat required with submission of the final plat.



            (2)   The subdivision plat shall conform to all
the requirements of this chapter and Iowa Code Chapter 354 and 355.



            (3)   The passage of a resolution by the City
Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of
the area shown on the final plat.  The applicant shall record the plat in
the office of the Recorder of Story County and shall file satisfactory
evidence of such recording in the office of the City Clerk before the City
shall recognize the plat as being in force.



            (4)   The subdivider must file the plat along with
all applicable covenants and other documentation within ten (10) days of the
approval of the plat by the City Council.



         G.   Plats Outside of Corporate Limits.



            (1)   Authority Within Two Miles of City Limits. 
Pursuant to the authority contained in Chapter 354 and 355 Code of Iowa, this
Code of Ordinances and the 28E Agreement between the City of Nevada and Story
County, Iowa, shall govern all territory outside the corporate limits of the
City but within two miles of such corporate limits, except to the extent that
ordinances or resolutions of the City Council shall limit their application
to an area less than two miles of such corporate limits.



            (2)   Procedures.  Procedures for the approval of
plats outside the corporate limits of Nevada, but lying within the two-mile
jurisdictional boundary, are outlined in the adopted 28E Agreement between
the City and Story County, and any subsequent amendments.  All applications
for subdivisions within this area shall be submitted to the Story County
Planning and Zoning Department, following procedures established by the Story
County Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Ordinance.  Upon receipt of the
application, the County Planning and Zoning Department shall forward copies
of the plat application to the City Planning Department.



      4.   Auditor’s Plats.  The Commission and the Council shall
have the right to waive provisions governing preliminary approval and public
improvements for auditor’s plats, provided that there is on file with the
Commission a copy of the request of the Story County Auditor ordering such a
plat and a letter from said Auditor stating that the plat as submitted meets
the requirements for which the plat was ordered.

166.12   SITE DESIGN AND CONSTRAINTS.



      1.   Consideration of Plans.  The design of subdivisions
shall consider all existing local and regional plans for the City and its
jurisdiction.  These include the Comprehensive Development Plan for the City.



      2.   Grading Permit Required.



         A.   A grading permit is required for erosion and
sediment control on all construction sites greater than 5 acres in size. 
Prior to grading or site disturbing activity, the developer shall apply to
the Zoning Administrator for a grading permit.  The application for a
grading permit shall include:



            (1)   A location map showing the location and
extent of grading activity.



            (2)   A Sediment and Erosion Control Plan.



         B.   After submission of a complete application for a
grading permit, the Zoning Administrator and his/her staff shall review the
application.  As part of the review, the Zoning Administrator shall
circulate the petition to any agency with statutory authority for the
management of drainageways and storm water management.



         C.   A grading permit shall be issued within ten working
days if the Zoning Administrator has received assurances from applicable
State agencies that the Sediment and Erosion Control Plan is compatible with
statute, and further that it is compatible with the objectives and policies
of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Ordinances.  If the
submitted Sediment and Erosion Control Plan is deemed inadequate, the
applicant will be given a list of mitigation measures that must be included
to ensure conformance.  The Zoning Administrator shall issue a grading
permit to the applicant upon certification that mitigation measures will be
taken as prescribed, consistent with applicable State and Federal regulations
regarding soil and sediment erosion, and environmental water quality.



      3.   Preservation of Natural Features and Drainage Patterns. 
To the maximum extent possible, development shall be located to preserve
natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity,
and to minimize negative impact and alteration of natural features and
drainage patterns.  The subdivider shall give maximum consideration to the
preservation of the following areas as open space, to the extent consistent
with reasonable utilization of land:



         A.   Wetlands and other unique environmental areas, as
defined in Section 404, Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 and
delineated on wetlands maps prepared by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Construction and fill activity shall be prohibited on wetlands in excess of
one-half acre in size.  Development and fill upon wetlands smaller than
one-half acre in size should be avoided whenever possible, but regulated by
permit authority of applicable State and Federal agencies.



         B.   Flood plain lands, other than areas that have
already experienced substantial development.



         C.   Slopes in excess of 15% as measured over a 10-foot
interval.  Development on slopes over 15% may be permitted only if an
erosion and slope stabilization plan is submitted and approved with the
development and if appropriate measures are taken in compliance with this
approved plan.  The City may, at its discretion, require the review and
certification of such a plan by a licensed Professional Engineer.



         D.   Habitats of endangered species.  Development shall
avoid fill or disturbance of habitat sites as identified on Federal or State
lists administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department
of the Interior, and applicable State environmental regulatory agencies. 
Developers are encouraged to preserve habitat areas as a connected open space
consistent with the parks and greenways system designated in the Nevada
Comprehensive Development Plan.



      4.   General Guidelines for Subdivision Layout.  Subdivisions
shall be designed to comply with the following overall performance objectives:



         A.   Avoidance of adverse effects on ground water and
aquifer recharge.



         B.   Reduction and minimizing of cut and fill.



         C.   Avoidance or reduction of unnecessary impervious
surfaces.



         D.   Prevention of flooding and encroachment of water
onto other properties.



         E.   Provision of adequate access to lots, including
alternative routes to lots and sites within the subdivision and minimizing of
cul-de-sacs over 300 feet.



         F.   Mitigation of negative environmental effects on
surrounding properties, including effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic,
drainage and utilities.



         G.   Respect for the urban character and traditional
layout of Nevada, including providing continuity to established street and
community facility networks; establishing linkages and connections between
new development and existing parts of the city; and preserving historically
and architecturally significant sites and buildings, determined as those
sites or districts either listed on or determined to be eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the State
Historic Preservation Officer.



         H.   Dedication of arterial, collector and key local
streets on the general alignments specified in the Comprehensive Development
Plan.



      5.   Site Design Objectives and Approval.  The Commission and
Council shall take the above Site Design objectives into account during their
review and approval of subdivision applications.



166.13   SUBDIVISION DESIGN CATEGORIES AND RULES.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to establish
design alternatives that provide greater flexibility in subdivision design
and make potential development more consistent with the City’s site design
objectives and the special features of the natural and built environment of
the City and its planning jurisdiction.



      2.   Subdivision Design Categories.



         A.   Definition and Application.  A conventional
subdivision literally meets all nominal standards of the Land Development
Ordinances for lot dimensions, setbacks, street frontage, and other site
development regulations.  Conventional subdivisions generally develop in
areas relatively free of environmental constraints.



         B.   Creative Subdivision.  A creative subdivision
complies with the overall density requirements of a zoning district, but
allows internal variations of such standards as lot size, setbacks and street
width in order to encourage innovative or economical development or protect
natural features and open space without loss of economic yield to developer.



      3.   Creative Subdivisions: Types and Special Regulations. 
Creative Subdivisions are divided into two types: Conservation Subdivisions
and Traditional Neighborhood Districts.



         A.   Conservation Subdivisions.



            (1)   Conservation subdivisions allow the
clustering or grouping of residential lots in order to provide common open
space.



            (2)   Conservation Subdivisions may be developed
and approved subject to the following standards and variations:



               a.   The overall density of subdivision
complies with the zoning district that contains the final subdivision.  A
subdivider may apply for a rezoning simultaneously with the plat approval
process.



               b.   Individual lot size dimensions,
including lot width, may be reduced to 60% of requirement of zoning
district.  Any savings on lot size shall be devoted to common open space or
other approved community facilities.



               c.   Lot setbacks may be varied from those
otherwise specified for the zoning district.  Setback limits must be
established on the preliminary and final plat.  The setback from any garage
entrance to any circulation way must be at least 25 feet.



               d.   Street or right-of-way widths set forth
in Section 166.14 may be varied within for local streets within Conservation
Subdivisions, subject to the sole discretion of the approving authorities.



               e.   Articles of incorporation or covenants
for a homeowners’ association or other provision assuring maintenance or
operation of all common spaces shall be submitted with subdivision
application.



         B.   Traditional Neighborhood Districts.  Traditional
Neighborhood District (TND) Subdivisions allow the development of urban
neighborhoods that produce new development consistent with the patterns of
historic or traditional parts of Nevada, with appropriate civic space; or
provide for the recreation of neighborhoods that follow the patterns of other
traditional towns.  Approval of a Traditional Neighborhood District
subdivision requires submission of a specific district plan.  TND
Subdivisions may be developed and approved subject to the following standards
and variations:



            (1)   The minimum size parcel to be covered by the
TND Subdivision is 5 acres.



            (2)   The overall density of subdivision complies
with the zoning district that contains the final subdivision.  A subdivider
may apply for a rezoning simultaneously with the plat approval process.



            (3)   Individual lot size dimensions, including
minimum width, may be reduced to 80% of the requirement of the underlying
zoning district.  Any savings on lot size shall be devoted to public space,
including but not limited to town squares, small parks, greenways and
community facilities.



            (4)   All streets within a TND Subdivision connect
to other streets within the district, forming a continuous network.  The
internal street system connects to other streets on the edge of the district.



            (5)   Lot setbacks may be varied from those
otherwise specified for the zoning district.  Setback limits must be
established on the preliminary and final plat.  The setback from any garage
entrance to any circulation way, including an alley, must be at least 25
feet.  Garage access from the rear of lots by way of an alley is encouraged.



            (6)   Retail, service, civic, office and various
types of residential land uses may be combined within a TND subdivision,
notwithstanding the use regulations of the underlying zoning district.  The
distribution and location of land uses shall be consistent with the TND Plan
submitted for the subdivision.



            (7)   Street or right-of-way widths set forth in
Section 166.14 may be varied within for local streets within TND
Subdivisions, subject to the sole discretion of the approving authorities.



            (8)   Overall density permitted by the underlying
zoning district of the TND Subdivision may be increased as follows for
specific amenities: 10% for the provision of a centrally located town square
of at least one acre for each 25 acres of developed area; 10% for the
provision of approved ornamental lighting throughout the TND Subdivision; and
10% for the development of a central community street, as defined in Section
166.14.  Cumulative density bonuses shall not exceed 25% of the density
permitted by the underlying zoning district.



            (9)   All applications for a TND Subdivision must
be accompanied by a TND Subdivision Plan, in addition to other documents
required by this chapter.  This plan shall illustrate the distribution of
land uses throughout the subdivision; the location and design of public
spaces, streets and alleys; the location and nature of special design
features; architectural controls; and other information necessary to
communicate the concept of the TND subdivision.  The TND Subdivision Plan
shall be a part of the approved subdivision.  Subsequent building and
development permits shall be issued by the City only in consistency with the
TND Subdivision Plan.



            (10)   Articles of incorporation and/or covenants
for a homeowners’ association or other provision assuring maintenance or
operation of all common spaces shall be submitted with subdivision
application.



166.14   CIRCULATION SYSTEM DESIGN.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to assure the
development of functional and safe circulation patterns within new
subdivisions, in order to encourage economical and effective movement of
motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians; provide access for public safety
vehicles; and encourage the development of circulation systems that enhance
the quality of life within new and existing neighborhoods in the City and its
planning jurisdiction.



      2.   General Standards.  The design of circulation systems
should conform to the following general standards and requirements:



         A.   Roadway System Design.



            (1)   The road system shall be designed to permit
safe and orderly movement of traffic, to meet but not exceed needs of the
present and future served population; to be simple and logical; to respect
natural features, topography, and landscape, and to present an attractive
streetscape.



            (2)   The system shall conform with the City’s
Comprehensive Plan.  For streets not shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the
arrangement of streets shall provide for the logical extension of existing
streets.



            (3)   The street network of a subdivision should
provide for logical, continuous extensions of streets to subsequent later
developments.  Such extensions shall make provision when necessary with a
temporary turnaround with a radius of at least 45 feet.



            (4)   The system shall provide adequate traffic
flow through a subdivision and provide at least two routes from each lot
within the subdivision to the rest of the City, except as explicitly
permitted by the approving authorities.  Additionally, the system should be
designed to discourage through traffic from using local streets.



         B.   Pedestrian and Bicycle Systems.



            (1)   A continuous pedestrian system shall be
provided within each non-industrial subdivision, designed to connect
pedestrians between every point in the subdivision in a safe manner.



            (2)   In conventional subdivisions, the pedestrian
system will ordinarily be provided by sidewalks placed parallel to and on
both sides of each street, with exceptions permitted to preserve natural
features, create visual interest, or maintain greenways and pedestrian ways
proposed in the Comprehensive Plan.



            (3)   In creative subdivisions, the pedestrian
system may be an independent network diverging from streets but providing
continuous pedestrian access between all points.



            (4)   All aspects of the pedestrian system,
including sidewalks and intersection crossings, must be designed to comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act.



            (5)   Bikeways or recreational trails shall be
required only if specifically indicated by the Comprehensive Development Plan.



      3.   Characteristics of Street Hierarchy and Design.



         A.   Streets shall be classified according to a street
hierarchy with design tailored to function.



         B.   The street hierarchy shall be defined by road
function and projected average daily traffic (ADT), as calculated by trip
generation rates prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or
other generally accepted standards.



         C.   Each residential street shall be classified and
designed to meet appropriate standards for its entire length.



         D.   The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the approving agencies that the distribution of traffic created by the
subdivision will not exceed the design capacity of the proposed street system
and its individual segments.



         E.   The categories, functions and projected traffic
loads of the street hierarchy are set forth in Table 166.14- 1.



      4.   Roadway Width.



         A.   Roadway width for each street classification is
determined by parking and curbing requirements based on form or intensity of
adjacent development.



         B.   To promote economical development of streets,
minimum Roadway width should generally be used.  Minimum Roadway widths are
set forth in Table 166.14-2.



      5.   Curbs, Gutters and Shoulders.



         A.   Curbing shall be required for the purposes of
safety, drainage, and protection of the pavement edge, as set forth in Table
166.14-3.



         B.   Requirements for curbs vary according to street
function and the nature of adjacent development.  Adjacent development is
defined as urban or rural as follows:



            (1)   Rural:  Residential or predominately
agricultural land use where average lot frontage exceeds 150 feet.



            (2)   Urban:  Residential land use where average
lot frontage is less than or equal to 150 feet; or adjacent land uses include
commercial, office, industrial or civic use types.



         C.   Where curbing is not required, edge definition,
shoulders and stabilization shall be provided.



         D.   Where curbing is required, shoulders and drainage
swales may be used only if soils or topography make the provision of
shoulders preferable to curbs; or where the character of an area is preserved
by the use of shoulders and drainage swales.



         E.   Shoulders, when developed, shall be at least eight
feet in width on each side for all streets; and located within
right-of-way.  Swale width is site-specific.  Shoulders shall consist of
stabilized turf, granular surfacing, or other acceptable material.



         F.   All curbs shall provide ramps for accessibility by
handicapped people consistent with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.



         G.   Curb construction shall follow standards
established by the City.



      6.   Sidewalks.



         A.   Sidewalk requirements are determined by road
classification and intensity of development, as set forth in Table 166.14-3.



         B.   Where sidewalks are not otherwise required by Table
166.14-3, the City may require their installation if necessary to provide
access to generators of pedestrian traffic or major community features; to
continue a walk on an adjacent street; to link parts of the City; or to
accommodate future development.



         C.   In conventional development, sidewalks shall be
placed generally parallel to streets within right-of-way.  Exceptions are
possible to preserve important natural features or to accommodate topography
or vegetation; when applicant shows an alternative for a safe and convenient
pedestrian system; or in creative subdivisions.



         D.   In commercial areas, sidewalks may abut curb.



         E.   Pedestrian rights-of-way at least 15 feet in width
may be required through the center of blocks over 600 feet in length if
deemed necessary by the approving authorities to provide access to schools or
community facilities; or to maintain a continuous pedestrian network within
and between subdivisions and districts of the City and its jurisdiction . 
Such rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public in the same manner as
streets.



         F.   Detached sidewalks shall provide a clear path of at
least four foot in width, free of any obstructions.



         G.   All sidewalks shall be constructed according to
current standards in use by the City.  Sidewalks shall be of concrete
construction four inches thick except at points of vehicular crossing where
they shall be six inches thick.



         H.   All sidewalks, crossings and other segments of a
continuous pedestrian system must comply with standards of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.



      7.   Bikeways and Recreational Trails.



         A.   Bikeways and recreational trails shall be required
in subdivisions only when specified as part of the Comprehensive Development
Plan.



         B.   All off-street recreational trails shall be a
minimum of eight (8) feet in width for two-way traffic and comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.  Surfacing of trails shall be acceptable to
the City.  Gradients for bikeways and recreational trails should not exceed
five percent, except for short distances.



         C.   Recreational trails may satisfy part of the
requirements of this chapter for sidewalks or open space.



         D.   All residential streets shall utilize bicycle safe
drainage grates at storm sewer inlets.



      8.   Rights-of-Way.



         A.   Measurement:  The right-of-way of a street shall
be measured from lot line to lot line, and shall be wide enough to contain
the roadway, curbs or shoulder, sidewalks and sidewalk setbacks, other
necessary graded areas, and utilities.



         B.   Any right-of-way that continues an existing street
shall be no less than that of existing street.



         C.   The requirements for right-of-ways for functional
categories of roads is set forth in Table 166.14-3.



         D.   Dedications:  Dedications of right-of-way for
collector, local, or arterial streets shall be made consistent with the
Comprehensive Development Plan.



      9.   Street Design Standards.



         A.   Pavement.



            (1)   All streets shall be paved to current
standards utilized in the City.



            (2)   Street pavement thickness shall relate to
the role of the street in the hierarchy, subgrade conditions and pavement
type.



         B.   Continuity of Arterial or Collector Streets.  No
subdivision shall prevent the extension of arterial or collector streets
through and beyond the subdivision.  The subdivider may plan and design
collector streets not designated in the Comprehensive Development Plan
subject to the approval of the City Council.



         C.   Cul-de-sacs.



            (1)   Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end
permanently closed shall not exceed 600 feet in length and shall be designed
so that vision from entrance to end is not restricted.



            (2)   The closed end of a cul-de-sac within a
conventional subdivision shall have a turnaround with a street property line
diameter of at least 130 feet in residential subdivisions.  This diameter
may be increased by the Planning and Zoning Commission if deemed necessary in
the case of a commercial or industrial subdivision.



         D.   Street Grades.  Maximum permitted street grades
are set forth in the Urban Design Standards for Public Improvements.  In
typical circumstances, the minimum permitted street gradient shall be 1.0%. 
In exceptional circumstances, the City Engineer may permit street gradients
of less than 1.0%; however, under no circumstances may the gradient be less
than 0.5%.



         E.   Street Intersections.



            (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible, unless limited by topography, existing street alignments,
or other clearly defined constraints.



            (2)   In most cases, no more than two streets
should intersect at a single intersection.



            (3)   Local streets shall not provide
intersections with major arterials.



            (4)   New intersections along one side of an
existing or proposed street shall, if possible, align with intersections on
the other side of the street.  Offsets between adjacent intersections shall
measure at least 150 feet between centerlines.  The use of T-intersections
is encouraged on local streets within the interior of a subdivision.



            (5)   Intersection design standards are set forth
in Table 166.14-2.



         F.   Block Size.  The length, widths, and shapes of
blocks shall be suited to the proposed land use and design of the proposed
subdivision.  Blocks within urban subdivisions shall not exceed 600 feet in
length, unless necessitated by exceptional topography or other demonstrable
constraints.  Blocks within rural subdivisions shall not exceed 900 feet.



         G.   Other design standards shall be as set forth in

Association and National Board of Fire Underwriters.



            (4)   Hydrants spaced for necessary fire flow and
provided with adequate means of drainage as approved by the City Engineer and
Fire Chief.  Hydrants shall be located no less than 150 feet from a
commercial use and 300 feet from a residential use, measured from the
geometric center of the lot.  All lines serving hydrants shall be at least
six inches in diameter, should be circulating lines, and should carry
appropriate State approvals.



            (5)   Installation of water systems shall conform
to community design standards in use within the City. 



            (6)   All State requirements shall be met and
approvals from the Department of Natural Resources shall be obtained for all
water systems.



      3.   Sanitary Sewers.



         A.   Connection.  All installations shall be properly
connected to an approved and functioning sanitary sewer system prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  If the City creates a benefit fund
for the purpose of financing public extensions of sanitary interceptor sewers
to newly developing areas, each subdivision to be benefited by such
extensions shall contribute to such a fund.  Subdivisions within the City
limits at the time of platting; or subdivisions currently served by existing
sanitary sewer service shall be exempt from this requirement.  Contributions
to the fund shall be computed on the basis of proportionate costs and
benefits of necessary extensions.  Assessments shall be made on a per lot
basis for single-family development; a pre-unit basis for multi-family
residential development; and a site area basis for nonresidential
development.  All proposals for new public sanitary sewer systems or
extensions of existing systems shall be approved by appropriate public
agencies.  All State requirements shall be met and approvals from the
Department of Natural Resources or other appropriate State agencies shall be
obtained for all waste disposal systems.



         B.   Capacity.



            (1)   The sanitary sewer system shall be adequate
to handle the necessary flow, based on complete development of the
subdivision.

accurate set of “as-built” system plans.



      4.   Storm Water Management.



         A.   All subdivisions shall have a storm water
management system that is adequate to prevent the undue or unplanned
detention of storm water on the site.  Undue detention does not include:



            (1)   Detention through planned facilities.



            (2)   Detention not substantially different from
pre-existing conditions.



         B.   Storm water management systems shall include pipe
design or overland storm flow adequate to successfully accommodate flows
created by a five-year storm without damage to the site or any other
properties.  The design of the storm water management system shall be
consistent with general and specific concerns and standards of the
Comprehensive Development Plan and the drainage control programs of
applicable public agencies.  Design shall be based on environmentally sound
site planning and engineering techniques.



         C.   To maximum degree possible, drainage from
subdivisions shall conform to natural contours of land and not disturb
pre-existing drainageways.



         D.   Adjacent properties shall not be unduly burdened
with surface water from the subdivision.  Specifically:



            (1)   There may be no unreasonable impediment of
water from higher adjacent properties across the subdivision, causing damage
to lower properties.



            (2)   No action shall unreasonably collect and
channel storm water onto lower properties.  The volume or rate of
post-development run off shall not exceed the amount of pre-development
runoff, and is to be managed in a manner consistent with Iowa statutes and
existing case law regarding such flows.



         E.   Design shall use the best available technology to
minimize off-site runoff, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural
drainage, and minimize discharge of pollutants.  Best available technology
may include retention basins, swales, porous paving, and terracing.



         F.   No surface water may be channeled into a sanitary
sewer system.



         G.   Where possible, a subdivision’s drainage system
shall coordinate with that of surrounding properties or streets.



         H.   All storm water design shall be reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer.  The preliminary plat submission must include
preliminary drainage computations and demonstrations that the proposed storm
water management system meets the requirements of this section.  A
certification from an Iowa Licensed Professional Engineer shall be filed with
the City certifying that the storm water management system of the subdivision
is designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this
section; and all applicable standards of the State of Iowa.  This
certification shall be affixed to an accurate set of “as-built” system
plans.



      5.   Erosion Control.  With the submission of the preliminary
plat, the subdivider shall submit an erosion control plan, prepared and
certified by an Iowa licensed Professional Engineer, for any land disturbing
activity greater than five acres.  All grading activities must be carried
out consistent with this approved erosion control plan and applicable State
requirements.



      6.   Parks and Public Facilities.  In order to serve the
educational and recreational needs of residents of the City and promote the
public health, welfare, community character and property values, subdividers
are required to donate resources to make improvements to the City’s parks
system as a condition of subdivision approval.



      7.   Parks Reservations.  The amount of park facilities for
development is partly based on data and policy in the Comprehensive Plan. 
The Plan reflects a local adaptation of standards of the National Recreation
and Park Association (NRPA).  The Comprehensive Plan is the result of a
system-wide technical analysis and citizen participatory planning process,
which identified near-term and long-range needs for the local parks system. 
Given these findings, the City has determined the following:



         A.   Dedication Required.  At the time of the final
plat approval by the City Council, each owner of land being subdivided shall
be required to dedicate, without cost to the City, five percent (5%) of the
land being subdivided to the City for parks and recreational purposes to
serve the immediate and future needs of the subdivision, development or
neighborhoods; or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a
combination of same.



         B.   Payment-in Lieu of Dedication.  Where dedication
of land is not feasible or compatible as determined by the City Council upon
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Parks and
Recreation Board, the owner of the land being platted shall pay to the City a
cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication otherwise required by this
section.  The payments shall be placed in a special fund by the City and
shall be used solely for the acquisition or development of parks and
recreational lands and facilities to serve the subdivision, the development,
or the neighborhood of which the subdivision or development is a part. 
However, if the City Council, upon the recommendation of the Parks and
Recreation Board, subsequently determines that:



            (1)   There is no present need for parks and
recreation acquisition, or development or improvement in the subdivision,
development or neighborhood in question, and



            (2)   The best interests of the entire City would
be served thereby.



   The payment received pursuant to this subsection may be applied in
whole or in part toward the acquisition, development, improvement or
maintenance of any park or parks within the City.  Any such determination by
the City Council shall be by motion on a separate and distinct agenda item
during any regular or special meeting of the City Council.



         C.   Value of Payment.  The payment-in-lieu of land
shall be based on five percent (5%) of the “developed value” of the acres
of land in the development that otherwise would have been dedicated as an
open space site.  The City and developer shall determine the value by taking
the value of the total development after subdividing and determining the
proportionate value of the land that would have otherwise been dedicated. 
Should either the City or the developer determine that the calculated value
does not reflect the “developed value” an appraisal shall be made by
three appraisers, one selected by the City, one selected by the developer,
and the third selected by the two appraisers.  Each party shall pay the fee
of their selected appraiser and the cost of the third shall be shared equally
by the City and the developer.  The “developed value” after subdividing,
determined by the appraisal shall be binding on both parties.



         D.   Location.  The City shall have the right to
designate the location of the area so dedicated, considering potential future
developments adjacent to land being platted.  Land donated for new parks
shall be located based generally on the City’s Comprehensive Plan and Maps
and shall specifically consider the design of each development and natural
features present.  The amount of land required shall not include wetlands,
floodway, or storm detention facilities, unless deemed acceptable by the
Parks and Recreation Board.



         E.   Combining Parks and Schools Lands.  Whenever
possible, and whenever in the best interests of the City and the affected
school district, land dedicated for parks and recreation sites shall be
contiguous to land dedicated for a school site.  Where the subdivision is
less than forty (40) acres, parks and recreation land to be donated should,
where possible, and in the best interests of the City and the affected school
district, be combined with donations from adjoining developments in order to
promote usable parks and recreation lands, and thereby minimize hardship on a
particular subdivider.



      8.   Reservation of Additional Lands.  The City Council may
require reservation of sites to be purchased for schools and other civic
facilities as a condition for approval of the subdivision.  Where the
Comprehensive Plan or the designation of the City calls for a larger amount
of land in a particular subdivision or planned development for park and
recreation use, or as additional public land that the subdivider is required
to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider’s contribution shall be
reserved for subsequent acquisition by the City.  Reservation of land for
public acquisition shall be for a period not to exceed three years from the
date that the plat is officially recorded.



      9.   Topography and Grading.  The slope, topography and
geology of the dedicated site and its surroundings must be suitable for its
intended purposes.  A subdivider shall allow the City to have access to the
proposed sites for the purpose of conducting soil boring tests.



      10.   Timing and Conveyance.  Unless otherwise determined
through a Subdivision Agreement, a subdivider shall convey to the City (or
such other governmental body, corporation or such owner as determined by the
City) the land required under this section at the time of final approval by
the City Council of the subdivision or re-subdivision plat or final
development plan, by the delivery of the following documents:



         A.   A good and sufficient Trustee’s or Warranty Deed
conveying fee simple title free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
(except liens or encumbrances dischargeable by cash accompanying said deed)
except for current real estate taxes;



         B.   A deposit of money equal to 100% of the most
ascertainable taxes for the year, pro-rated to the date that the deed is
delivered;



         C.   A plat of survey containing thereon the legal
description of the property to be conveyed and any other matters which may be
required by the City Administrator, as advised by the Zoning Administrator,
City Attorney and the consulting City Engineer.



      11.   Timing of Payment.  Cash contributions required under
this section shall be paid as follows:



         A.   Fees Paid Prior to Final Plat.  Unless otherwise
provided by the terms of a developer agreement entered into between the City
and the subdivider, all fees required pursuant to this section, including
fees arising from the development of land located in the City’s two-mile
planning jurisdiction that may be subject of an intergovernmental agreement,
shall be due and owing prior to the final plat approval by the City
Council.  However, if the subdivider’s lands are the subject of an
annexation agreement, payment shall be made at the times and in the manner
provided in said annexation agreement.



         B.   Procedures for Fee Collection and Administration. 
It shall be the duty of the Finance Officer or other official designated by
the City Council to establish regulations and procedures for the collection
and administration of the cash contributions required under this section.



      12.   Developer Agreements.  The City may enter into a
Developer Agreement with any subdivider which sets forth the time and manner
of compliance with the terms of this section and implementation of any other
provisions of these regulations.  If any developer agreement has previously
been entered into between the City and a subdivider, and that Agreement
remains in full force and effect, the provisions of that agreement shall
control, and this section shall have no force and effect, provided that the
subdivider complies with the terms of such Agreement.  However, if such
subdivider is not complying with the terms of that Agreement then the
provisions of this section shall apply and the City shall utilize the
criteria set forth herein to determine the appropriate exaction amount, less
credits, if any.  Further, if the development contemplated by a subdivider
has either increased in number of units or has otherwise increased the demand
for park and recreation facilities, then the developer Agreement previously
entered into between the subdivider and the City shall be amended and the
subdivider shall provide additional land, or a pro-rata fee, based on the
provisions of this section, less credits, if any.



      13.   Utility Easements.



         A.   Urban Subdivisions:  Easements for utilities shall
be provided for in the subdivision dedication allowing for the construction,
maintenance, repair and replacement of utilities.  Such easements shall be
at least 10 feet in width.



         B.   Easements of greater width may be required along
lot lines or across lots.  Easements of lesser width may be approved if
accepted by utility providers.  Easements shall connect with easements on
adjoining properties. 



         C.   Easements shall be approved in writing by any
appropriate public or private utility provider intending to use such easement
for their facilities.  Such approval shall be submitted prior to final plat
approval.



         D.   Rural Subdivisions:  Easements for utilities shall
be placed within street rights-of-way, without requirements for additional
utility easements.



      14.   Drainage Easements.  Where a subdivision is crossed by
a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided.  It shall correspond generally with
the extent of such watercourse, together with any additional construction or
expansion necessary to allow it to conduct storm water adequately. 
Easements shall extend not less than 20 feet on each side from the centerline
of the waterway.  The total width of any easement shall be sufficient to
cover the 100-year flood plain calculated for a fully developed upstream
drainage basin.  Parallel streets or parkways may be utilized to preserve
such drainageways.



      15.   Setback Requirements for Structures Adjacent to Creeks
and Drainageways.



         A.   In addition to other applicable provisions of this
Code of Ordinances, no persons shall be granted a permit for the construction
of any structure, exclusive of fences, bank stabilization structures, poles
signs, and non-related parking areas adjacent to any creek or stream unless
such structure is located so that no portion whereof is any closer to the
stream than will allow a maximum 3:1 slope between the water’s edge (during
normal flow conditions) of the stream and the closest point of the structure
at-grade.



         B.   An exemption from the provisions of paragraph A
above may be granted if all of the following conditions are met and required
certification is filed with the City:



            (1)   Certification by an Iowa Licensed
Professional Engineer or architect that adequate bank stabilization
structures or slope protection will be installed in the construction of said
structure, having an estimated useful life equal to that of the structure,
which will provide adequate lateral support so that no portion of the
structure adjacent to the stream will be endangered by erosion or lack of
lateral support.



            (2)   Certification shall be affixed to an
accurate set of “as-built” construction plans for the structure, as well
as “as-built” plans of depicting any bank stabilization or slope
protection measures or structures.



            (3)   In the event that the structure is adjacent
to any stream that has been channelized or otherwise improved by any agency
of government, then such certification providing this exemption must take the
form of a certification as to the adequacy and protection of the improvements
installed by such governmental unit.



      16.   Other Easements.  The subdivision shall provide
easements for other public utilities that cross through it, in a form
acceptable to the City or appropriate public agency.



      17.   Dedications.  Before final plat approval is granted to
the subdivision, dedications to public use of all streets, alleys, other
public right-of-ways, or other parks and public lands shall be completed as
required by this chapter.



166.16   IMPROVEMENT FINANCING AND GUARANTEES.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to ensure the
equitable financing and proper installation and maintenance of required
streets, utilities, and other improvements.  The guarantee shall be
structured to provide adequate assurances to the City while not adding
unnecessary costs to the developer.



      2.   Application.  This section applies to subdivisions which
require the installation of streets, utilities or other public improvements
by the City or developer.



      3.   Responsibility of Subdivider.  The subdivider shall be
responsible for the installation and construction of all improvements
required by this chapter and shall warrant the design, materials,
workmanship, construction and performance of such improvements for two (2)
years in the case of utilities and four (4) years in the case of pavement
after the date of completion and acceptance by the City.  Such bonds or
letters of credit shall be in a form acceptable by the City. 



      4.   Condition for Approval of Plat.  As a condition for
final approval, each subdivision plat must include a subdivision agreement
entered into between the City and the subdivider.  Additionally, no contract
for the construction of public improvements involving a subdivision within
the extraterritorial jurisdiction but outside the corporate limits of the
City shall be awarded without the approval of such an agreement.



      5.   Components of the Subdivision Agreement.  The agreement
shall include provisions for the financing and distribution of
responsibilities among the City and the subdivider for land acquisition,
design and installation of public improvements.  The agreement shall also
state specifically how public services will be provided in the subdivision
prior to annexation by the City.



      6.   Rules for Distributing Improvement Costs.  Generally,
the following rules shall be followed in distributing costs for public
improvements:



         A.   Public Costs.  Allowable public costs will be
those items that have demonstrable benefit to the general public.  These
items may include:



            (1)   Pavement width in excess of 31 feet for
streets designated as collector or arterial streets in the Comprehensive
Development Plan or any subsequent amendment thereof.  On collector and
arterial streets requiring a higher standard of paving than normal, the
additional cost shall be borne by the City or other public agency.



            (2)   The incremental cost of water mains over
eight inches.



            (3)   Oversized storm sewers or drainage
structures required to serve other areas in the watershed.  Such expenses
may also be assessed on an area basis to properties served by the improvement.



            (4)   Sanitary outfall sewers or water lines
outside of the limits of a subdivision that serve areas larger than that of
the subdivision, provided that such extension is consistent with the
sequencing of development specified in the Comprehensive Development Plan.



            (5)   The additional costs of sanitary sewers over
8 inches in diameter, when such sewers are required by the City.



            (6)   Parks and recreation facilities consistent
with the Comprehensive Development Plan.



            (7)   Those costs required to be paid by the City
for extension of water and sewer lines, pursuant to this Code of Ordinances.



         B.   Private Costs.  Allowable special assessment costs
will be those items that have direct benefit primarily to adjacent
properties.  These items may include:



            (1)   The entire cost of grading street
rights-of-way, including intersections.



            (2)   All sanitary sewer lines serving the
subdivision up to 8 inches and water lines serving the subdivision up to 8
inches.



            (3)   All paving and street construction,
including curbs and gutters, up to a roadway width of 31 feet.



            (4)   A storm water management system adequate to
provide for the collection, retention, and removal of surface runoff,
extending to the boundaries of the subdivision



            (5)   Sidewalks as required by this chapter. 
Construction of sidewalks may be delayed until after completion of site
grading and construction, but must be completed prior to occupancy of the
structure.



            (6)   The contract charge for underground
electrical and gas service.



            (7)   An iron rod not less than one-half inch in
diameter and 24 inches in length as follows:



               a.   At the intersection of all lines
forming angles in the boundary of the subdivision and at all street
intersections.



               b.   At lot corners and changes in direction
of block and lot boundaries.



            (8)   Those costs required to be paid by the
developer for extension of water and sewer lines, pursuant to this Code of
Ordinances.



      7.   Subdivisions Contiguous with City.  Unless otherwise
provided as a specific part of the subdivision approval by the City, all
subdivisions now or hereafter laid out adjoining or contiguous to the
corporate limits of the City shall be included within such corporate limits
and become a part of the City.  The residents of the subdivision shall be
entitled to all the rights and privileges and subject to all laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations of the City.



      8.   Performance Guarantees.  As a condition of the final
approval of the plat and prior to its recording with the Story County
Recorder, the City Council shall require and accept the following:



         A.   The furnishing of a performance bond, letter of
credit, cash escrow, or other guarantee in a form acceptable to the City, in
an amount not to exceed 100% of the estimated cost of the improvement
installation.



         B.   A specification of the time allowed for the
installation of improvements.  This period may be extended by the City
Council.



         C.   The performance guarantee amount and requirement,
along with the permitted time for installation, shall be included within the
Subdivision Agreement negotiated between the City and the Developer and
approved with the final plat.



      9.   Notification of Completion and Acceptance by City.



         A.   Notification.  Upon substantial completion of all
required improvements, the developer shall notify the City Engineer in
writing, as well as submitting a certification from an Iowa Licensed
Professional Engineer, attesting to the adequacy of the installation.  The
term “City Engineer” shall include a consulting engineer retained on a
regular basis by the City to review development applications and perform
various engineering services.



         B.   Inspection and Acceptance.



            (1)   The City Engineer shall inspect all
installations, and shall approve, partially approve, or disapprove the
installation.  Upon completion of improvements, he/she shall file a
statement with the City Council and Zoning Administrator certifying that the
improvements have been completed satisfactorily or listing the defects in the
improvements.



            (2)   If the installation is approved, the City
Engineer shall notify the Developer of acceptance in writing.  Such
acceptance shall release the developer from liability pursuant to the
performance guarantee for the installation.  The City has the right to
retain up to 10% of the value of the performance guarantee for a period of up
to one year from the date of acceptance to remedy any deficiencies which
appear during that period.



            (3)   If improvements are not accepted or not
completed within the specified time, the performance guarantee shall be
forfeited and used by the City to complete satisfactory installation of
improvements.



            (4)   No residential occupancy permits shall be
issued for a subdivision unless the installation of improvements has been
inspected and approved in full by the City Engineer.



            (5)   Inspection costs shall be paid for by the
Developer.
