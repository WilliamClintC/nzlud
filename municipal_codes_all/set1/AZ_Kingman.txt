3.300 PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS (R-1-6 ZONING DISTRICT ONLY): 
 
1. All newly created lots shall be not less than six-thousand (6,000) square feet or less than fifty (50) feet in width.   


 
2. The City of Kingman, however, recognizes that a large number of subdivisions were platted in sizes that do not meet modern subdivision standards.  Many of these subdivisions in the Kingman area were recorded prior to January 1, 1945 and are now within the City limits of the City of Kingman.  Further, the City recognizes that it is in the interest of the City and in accord with the Kingman General Plan to infill, develop these old subdivisions, and thus contribute to the strategy of minimizing sprawl development.  To assist in implementing these objectives the following regulations shall apply in R-1-6 districts in which all original lots were platted prior to January 1, 1945. 


 
3. For lots platted in subdivisions originally recorded prior to January 1, 1945, located in R-1-6 Zoning Districts, and platted in lot sizes of primarily twenty-five feet by one-hundred feet (25’x100’) or fifty feet by one-hundred feet (50’x100’), building sites may be used in any configuration for a single family detached home.  The building site must have a minimum of five-thousand (5,000) square feet and the site width must be a minimum of fifty (50) feet. 


 
4. For lots platted in subdivisions originally recorded prior to January 1, 1945, located in R-1-6 zoning districts, and originally platted in lot sizes of forty feet by one-hundred feet (40’x100’), the minimum building site area for a single family detached home continues to be six-thousand (6,000) square feet, with lot width a minimum of  fifty (50) feet.  However, if modern resurvey of the area has shown that errors in the original survey occurred such that the original building site dimensions were in error, then the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve single-family detached home permits provided the building site area is not less than fifty-nine-hundred (5,900) square feet.  The Zoning Administrator must be satisfied that the problem is a survey correction matter and was not self-imposed by the owner or developer.

4.3120 ABUTTING PROPERTY LINES 
 
All land uses abutting the property lines of a proposed multiple-family development shall be listed on or attached to the site plan.  A list of all land use activities adjacent to the development will aid the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council in protecting the public’s health, safety and welfare against any incompatible uses. 
 
4.400 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL 
 
At the time of application for a building permit, the applicant shall supply the building department with a detailed site plan drawn to scale that shows the location and dimension of all buildings, driveways, parking areas, setbacks and areas of open space.  This site plan shall also show in the legend; legal description, existing zoning, total lot area, total number of apartment units, total common open space area, density, number of parking spaces, and typical unit size.  Each development reviewed shall require as a condition of approval the following additional criteria: 
 
1. Soil evaluation for land use compatibilities*, 


 
2. Water and sewer availability (line size and capacity), 


 
3. Ready access to an arterial (without increasing traffic in a single-family residential neighborhood), 


 
4. Compatibility with existing land uses, 


 
5. Drainage considerations, flood plain analysis **, 


 
6. And parcel size. 


 
These criteria are necessary to reduce detrimental impacts to the land/property (i.e. carrying capacity of soils, drainage, water and sewerage facilities, and surrounding land uses, specifically single-family residential areas). 
 
 
*  The soil type of the proposed development site shall be determined by the Staff, using the soil inventory developed by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.  If the site is located in a soil type that reflects limitations for high-density development, the City shall ask the Soil Conservation Service Office to provide a site-specific evaluation of the property.  If this evaluation reflects severe limitation problems for the proposed development, the developer may be required to provide a detailed soils analysis prepared by a qualified testing laboratory. 
 
**  If the proposed development site is located in an “A” zone as identified by the Flood Insurance Rate Map (F.I.R.M.), a drainage report shall be prepared by a qualified registrant outlining the method proposed to eliminate flooding problems.

10.000 LANDSCAPING 
 
10.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE 
 
To promote attractive and high quality development, it is the purpose of these regulations to establish standards for landscaping in order to preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the City.  Creative, safe, attractive landscaped areas will be encouraged to be installed adjacent to public streets, dispersed throughout parking areas and used to ensure compatibility of adjacent land uses.  It is hereby recognized that the effective use of plant landscaping controls dust, glare, and erosion; assists in the screening of objectionable light and noise; visually softens building masses; improves air quality; and helps to create harmony, continuity and the enhancement of property values throughout the community.  The style of landscape is not prescribed by the City of Kingman; however, the planting of indigenous, drought tolerant, and low maintenance plants that conserve water and minimize fire hazards will be encouraged. 
 
10.200 APPLICABILITY 
 
A. These standards shall apply to Commercial, Industrial and Multiple-Family developments in the following manner: 


 
1. This section shall apply to all new commercial, industrial, and multiple-family development. 


 
2. These regulations shall also apply to any redevelopment, addition or remodeling of any multiple-family, commercial, or industrial property that requires a building permit and for which the improvement increases the area of the building or area of the developed portion of the property by twenty-five percent (25%) or more, or for which the improvement costs exceed twenty-thousand dollars ($20,000.00) in value, based on the City’s valuation schedule used to compute building permit fees. 


 
3. Further, these provisions shall apply to any building or site that might require rezoning, variance, or conditional use permit approval. 


 
B. On lots or parcels that are one-half acre or less, prior to approval of a final inspection and occupancy of a residence, the required front and street-side yard areas shall be landscaped with decorative rock, lawn, trees, shrubs, or other plant materials, and shall be permanently maintained in a neat and orderly manner as a condition to use.  Decorative screen-types walls, forty-two (42) inches or less in height where an integral part of landscaping scheme composed primarily of plant materials are permitted.

G. SIGHT TRIANGLE:   


 
1. To ensure that landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard, a “sight triangle” will be maintained at all street intersections or intersections of driveways with streets.

1. All landscape areas containing living plant materials shall be supported by an automatic irrigation system.   



 
2. A backflow prevention assembly shall be provided with the installation of all irrigation systems according to standard details adopted by the City of Kingman.   



 
3. Under certain soil conditions, irrigation systems shall be located a minimum distance from structures as may be recommended by a geotechnical report.   



 
4. All irrigation systems and landscape areas shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to promote water conservation, and to prevent water overflow or seepage into the street, sidewalk, or parking areas. 



 
C. EXTENT OF LANDSCAPING AREAS:  Any part of a site not graded, developed, and used for buildings, parking, driveways, sidewalks, utilities, stormwater detention areas, and approved storage shall be retained in its present vegetative natural state or landscaped.

F. STORM WATER DETENTION AREAS:  Storm water detention areas, including detention areas located in perimeter landscape areas defined in Section 10.410(E)2(e), may be landscaped in accordance with the requirements of this code.  When used, weed barriers, such as landscape fabric, should be permeable to aid in the absorption of storm water generated by the development on-site.  If non-permeable sheet plastic is used in landscape areas, the project engineer shall account for the effects on runoff when calculating the storm detention required for the site.  


 
 
 
 
 
10.430 EXEMPTION 
 
Properties with over ninety-five percent (95%) of the gross site area developed with buildings, off-street parking, sidewalks, and other similar hardscape are exempt from the requirements of 10.410(A)2 when a building is being remodeled.  However, any expansion of the existing building envelope or the construction of additional buildings on the same property remains subject to the requirements of 10.410(A)2.              
 
10.440 MAINTENANCE 
 
Maintenance of all landscaping shall be the responsibility of the owner, lessee, heirs, assigns, agent, or other liable entity of the property.  Landscaped areas shall be regularly maintained, including pruning, mowing, weeding, trimming, watering, refuse removal, fertilizing, and maintenance of the irrigation systems, to create an attractive appearance for the development.  Any dead plant material shall be replaced by the property owner within forty-five (45) days of its demise. 
 
Public and private utilities will be responsible for the replacement and repair of landscaping materials specifically damaged by their construction in the public right-of-way.  However, unless otherwise specified, the continuing maintenance of landscaping in the public right-of-way is the responsibility of the adjacent property owner.

12.360 OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING 
 
See Section 22.000: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 
 
 
 
 
 
12.370 CONDUCT OF USES 
 
All business, service, storage, and merchandise display shall be conducted wholly within an enclosed building, including porches, except for off-street automobile parking, off street loading, and the usual pumping operations of gasoline sales, or as provided herein in an overlay district. 
 
Because of the unique fabric and historic character of the area characterized by a large number of National Register of Historic Places buildings, a Historic Commercial Overlay District, for all lots facing onto both the north and south sides of Beale Street from First Street to Eighth Streets is hereby created. 
 
The following regulations apply only in the Historic Commercial Overlay District created above: 
 
1. For the converted commercial uses that have traditional residential style setbacks (typically ten (10) feet to twenty (20) feet setbacks from the street line), “displays” would be allowed in fifty percent (50%) of any yard area visible from a street.  Within this fifty percent (50%) yard area, displays are allowed provided the items are displayed not higher than six (6) feet in height and displays are setback five (5) feet from side property lines. 


 
2. For “O” front lot line commercial buildings, up to three (3) items could be displayed, but not for sale, on the sidewalk (no motor vehicles), provided normal and safe pedestrian movement is not compromised. 


 
When a lot is used for commercial purposes and abuts a lot within any developed residential district, a masonry wall of not less than six (6) feet or more than eight (8) feet in height shall be erected and maintained along the abutting side and/or rear yard line prior to occupancy of the building.  
 
Said wall shall be reduced to thirty-six (36) inches in height within a required front yard of the adjacent residential property.  In the case where the developed commercial lot abuts an undeveloped residential district, which has been identified as having commercial potential by an approved land use plan, the masonry wall requirement may be deferred until such time as the abutting lot is developed in a residential manner.  At this point in time, the owner of the abutting commercial property shall have six (6) months, from the date of Certificate of Occupancy for the residence is issued, to construct the required masonry wall.  If there is a dedicated alley or public roadway separating the commercial property from the residential property, the alley or public roadway shall serve as the buffer and the masonry wall shall not be required unless so specified by ordinance relating to the rezoning of the subject property.

14.000 C-2: HMR OVERLAY DISTRICT: DISTRICT REVIEW MANUAL FOR THE HUALAPAI MOUNTAIN ROAD AREA 
 
14.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE 
 
This Design Review Manual is established to provide general development, design, and performance standards and use and conditional uses for the study areas covered by the Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan.  These standards are intended and designed to aid in the implementation of the General Plan; to encourage sound design principles; to assure the compatibility of uses; to encourage attractive appearances; to prevent blight; and to promote and enhance the health, safety and general welfare of the residents in the community. 
 
This manual establishes minimum standards.  The City encourages developers and landowners to exceed these minimums whenever possible.  Design standards and uses regulations herein shall be applied as shown in the Hualapai Mountain Road Exhibit map. 
 
14.200 INTRODUCTION 
 
The 1988 Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan required the development of a Design Review Manual to be used in conjunction with the Area Plan.  This was reinforced by the adoption of the Kingman General Plan 2020.  The City suggests designing within a broad range of southwestern architectural styles and requires high quality and creative developments that are architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and the colors and textures of the surrounding environment. 
 
During the design review process, the City will be looking at more than just a building’s design.  A project’s layout, its relationship to the immediate neighborhood and its relationship to the entire study areas will also be examined.  Special considerations are given to sign, landscaping, screening and setback requirements which are more specific than other City of Kingman Zoning districts.  It should be understood that the City Staff can make suggestions on how to solve design problems for the applicant, but the applicant should also consult their design professional. 
 
The design review guidelines have been placed under general headings to facilitate their uses. 
 
14.300 APPLICABILITY 
 
The standards set forth in this Manual shall apply to: 
 
1. Hualapai Mountain Road, and Mission Boulevard, a minimum of three-hundred (300) feet either side of the roads and all properties as outlined in the Map exhibit attached herein. 


 
2. All commercial and multiple-family developments, within the specified corridor. 


 
14.400 PROCEDURE 
 
The initial design review will be done in house by the City Planning Staff.  Currently the Planning Staff reviews all preliminary and final subdivision plats, parcel plats, site plans/building permits, sign permits, variance requests, rezoning requests, conditional use permit requests, business license applications, and general plan/area plan amendment requests.  The Mohave County Planning Department refers certain development proposals for land adjacent to the City limits to the City Planning Staff for review, in accord with the Kingman General Plan 2020 policies.  For Section 16: State Urban Land, the State Land Department will refer all development proposals to the City Staff for their review and comment.  In this manner, City Planning Staff will be able to check development in the study areas for their adherence to the design review guidelines. 
 
A checklist or required design review elements (see Exhibit A in the back of this section) shall be filled out and attached to all project reviews that are subject to these guidelines.  This in-house procedure should minimize extra paperwork and any time delays for project reviews.  Any decision or finding made on any element in Exhibit A (in the back of this section) shall be given to the applicant in writing with reasons for such decision or finding. 
 
All developments within the City limits must comply with all other applicable provisions of Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and all other relevant City regulations.  Where conflicts occur, the more restrictive regulations will be applied.  All developments outside of the City limits must adhere to the applicable Mohave County regulations.  This Design Review Manual, along with the Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan, gives City Staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Common Council a basis upon which to make policy and procedural recommendations to Mohave County and the State Land Department for the lands which are included in the Area Plan, but which lie outside of the City limits, in accord with the Kingman General Plan 2020 policies. 
 
It is recommended that anyone who is considering a development project within the study areas should make an appointment with City Planning Staff for preliminary discussions and review.  This pre-development conference can help reduce errors and omissions and can alleviate potential problems before final plan are drawn up. 
 
14.500 APPEALS 
 
Appeals from any decision made during the in-house administrative design review only shall be made to the City Planning and Zoning Commission.  Such appeal shall be in writing and shall state such reasons why the applicant feels the decision was in error.  The Commission will then forward their recommendation to the City Common Council.  Final action shall be taken by the City Council.  Uses are not subject to appeal in accord with ARS 9-466.06 H(1), but would be reviewed via text amendment process only.

2. Projects shall be designed to minimize interference with the privacy, quiet and views of neighbors. 


 
3. Projects shall be designed to minimize traffic problems. 


 
4. Projects shall be designed to retain a site’s natural topography whenever possible.  The project should be planned to fit the site’s natural conditions rather than altering the site to accommodate the project.  Excessive cuts and fills should be avoided. 


 
5. The street grid should respond to topography.  Curvilinear streets may have to be used in some instances. 


 
6. All developments shall have the buildings setback a minimum of twenty (20) feet from all property lines and along the adjacent street(s). 


 
7. Curb cuts on to Hualapai Mountain Road and Mission Blvd. and collector streets shall be limited.  The guidelines for access onto major arterial, minor arterial, and collector streets as defined by the City of Kingman Streets and Sidewalks Development Rules and Regulations are as follows: 


 
a. No driveway onto a minor arterial street or collector street shall be located closer than one-hundred (100) feet to the nearest intersecting curb line.  No driveway onto a major arterial street shall be located closer than two-hundred (200) feet to the nearest intersecting curb line.  If these minimum distances cannot be achieved within the property limits, the driveway shall be placed as far from the intersection as possible.  Commercial driveways that do not meet the minimum distance from the curb return may be restricted to right-in, right-out driveway configurations. 


 
b. Access to and from Hualapai Mountain Road and Mission Blvd. and collector streets should be limited to street intersections.  Where a corner lot abuts Hualapai Mountain Road or Mission Boulevard and a collector or local side street, driveway access shall be permitted only on the non-arterial side street.  One (1) driveway will be permitted when the frontage is less than three-hundred (300) feet.  Two (2) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is three-hundred (300) to six-hundred (600) feet.  Three (3) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is greater than six-hundred (600) feet. 


 
c. The use of shared driveways between adjacent parcels will be required when appropriate and is encouraged whenever possible. 


 
d. Adjacent driveways should be no closer than sixty (60) feet unless there is clearly no alternative access available. 


 
e. Driveways on opposite sides of a street should not be offset less than one-hundred-fifty (150) feet. 


 
8. A main driveway into a site should have adequate space for stacking of vehicles.  If over forty (40) parking spaces are required by the use and building size, fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces should be located to the side or rear of the proposed building. 


 
9. Sidewalks and tree landscaping (properly irrigated and maintained by the property owner) shall be required as properties develop along Hualapai Mountain Road. 


 
10. Exterior lighting, when used, shall adhere to Section 34.000: OUTDOOR LIGHTING CODE, of the City Zoning Ordinance. 


 
11. There should be a pleasant transition from the street to the buildings.  This can be accomplished by the use of sidewalks and landscaping. 


 
12. The site organization of a project should take into consideration the arrangement of building in relation to open spaces, landscaping and the elements of adjacent sites. 


 
13. Proportion, scale, continuity and balance should prevail in all aspects of a project. 


 
 
 
 
 
14.900 BUILDINGS 
 
1. The maximum height for all buildings shall be thirty (30) feet. 


 
2. The intent of the design review is to create architectural design quality, based on a common set of principles which include consideration of the unique environment, climate, and context of the Hualapai Mountain Road and Mission Blvd. area and its natural setting in the City of Kingman.  A broad Southwestern theme, is the appropriate and desired architectural style in the Hualapai Mountain Road, Mission Blvd. context, however this theme is not intended to limit architectural innovation within the general styles below.  These styles include: Southwestern Traditional, Arizona Territorial, Pueblo, and Spanish Colonial. 


 
3. Buildings shall be compatible with the neighborhood character. 


 
4. Buildings shall be compatible with the colors and textures of the surrounding environment.  Warm earth tone colors shall be used.  This would not exclude the ability of a user to express a corporate logo or color as a minor element in the overall design. 


 
5. Highly reflective materials that create glare shall not be used.  Preferred exterior materials shall be stucco, brick, adobe, natural stone, textured concrete, or textured and split face concrete masonry units.  Materials such as pre-fabricated metal wall panels and smooth faced concrete shall not be used. 


 
6. All glass or all metal buildings, including accessory buildings and structures visible from any street shall be avoided. 


 
7. Reduce the apparent size and mass of buildings.  Break up the mass of large buildings by dividing into basic geometric components with intersecting wall planes.  Long blank walls, even with appropriate colors, are not permitted.  Walls shall not have runs of greater than twenty-five (25) linear feet without an architectural feature breaking up the expanse.  These features could be columns with contrasting but complimentary colors, pilasters, tile contrasts, varied facades or parapets. 


 
8. Any exposed roof to street view shall use complimentary colored ceramic tile, or a method compatible with the themes and intents above.

15.000: BANK STREET DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT 
 
15.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE 
 
This Design Review Manual is established to provide general development performance and design standards for commercial, multiple-family residential or light industrial uses for the area defined as: either side of Bank Street, from Gordon Drive south to Airway Avenue.  Specifically this would include the following areas: 
 
1. The eastside of Bank from Kino to Airway, three-hundred (300) feet to the east within this metes and bounds area, and would include any portion of Kino Ranch subdivision, three-hundred (300) feet to the east, if this subdivision phase is finally recorded; 


 
2. Eastside of Bank Street including the Eastside lots in Shangri-La Estates, second Amended, two-hundred-seventy-one (271) feet deep, including the first tier of lots in Shangri-La; 


 
3. Westside of Bank from Kino to Gordon, within Lake Mohave Country Club Estates, two-hundred-twenty-five (225) feet to the west (first tier of lots); 


 
4. Westside of Bank from Kino south to Airway, a portion of Banks Airport Addition, two-hundred (200) feet to the west.  If lots face Nevada and are developed together with lots facing Bank, they would be included. 


 
The Kingman General Plan 2020 identifies this area as appropriate for commercial zoning, thus generally these standards will apply to any commercial development in this corridor.  These standards are intended and designed to aid in the implementation of the Kingman General Plan, to encourage sound design principals; to assure the compatibility of uses; to encourage attractive appearances; to prevent blight; and to promote and enhance the health, safety and general welfare of the residents in the community. 
 
This manual establishes minimum standards.  The City encourages developers and landowners to exceed these minimums whenever possible. 
 
15.200 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Bank Street design corridor Design Review Manual is to be used in conjunction with the Area Plan.  This was reinforced by the adoption of the Kingman General Plan 2020.  The City does not propose to establish a specific theme, but rather encourages high quality and creative developments that are architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and the colors and textures of the surrounding environment. 
 
During the design review process, the City will be looking at more than just a building’s design.  A project’s layout, its relationship to the immediate neighborhood and its relationship to the entire study areas will also be examined.  Special considerations are given to sign, landscaping, screening and setback requirements which are more specific than the City’s Zoning Ordinance.  It should be understood that the City Staff does not solve design problems for the applicant. 
 
15.300 APPLICABILITY 
 
The standards set forth in this Manual shall apply to: 
 
1. Specifically this would include the following areas: 


 
a. The eastside of Bank from Kino to Airway, three-hundred (300) feet to the east within this metes and bounds area, and would include any portion of Kino Ranch subdivision, three-hundred (300) feet to the east, if this subdivision phase if finally recorded; 

b. Eastside of Bank Street including the Eastside lots in Shangri-La Estates, second Amended, two-hundred-seventy-one (271) feet deep, including the first tier of lots in Shangri-La; 


 
c. Westside of Bank from Kino to Gordon, within Lake Mohave Country Club Estates, two-hundred-twenty-five (225) feet to the west (first tier of lots); 


 
d. Westside of Bank from Kino south to Airway, a portion of Banks Airport Addition, two-hundred (200) feet to the west.  If lots face Nevada and are developed together with lots facing Bank, they would be included. 


 
2. All commercial, industrial developments and multiple-family uses within the defined corridor. 


 
15.400 APPLICABILITY 
 
The primary review will be done in-house by the City Planning Staff. 
 
A checklist or required design review elements shall be filled out and attached to all project reviews that are subject to these guidelines.  This in-house procedure should minimize extra paperwork and any time delays for project reviews.  Any decision or finding made on any element in Exhibit 1 shall be given to the applicant in writing with reasons for such decision or finding. 
 
All developments within the City limits must comply with all other applicable provisions of Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and all other relevant City regulations.  Where conflicts occur, the more restrictive regulations will be applied.  This Design Review Manual, along with the Kingman General Plan, gives City Staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Common Council a basis upon which to make policy and procedural recommendations. 
 
It is recommended that anyone who is considering a development project within the Bank Street defined area should make an appointment with City Planning Staff for preliminary discussions and review.  This pre-development conference can help reduce errors and omissions and can alleviate potential problems before final plans are drawn up. 
 
15.500 APPEALS 
 
Appeals from any decision made during the in-house administrative design review only shall be made to the City Planning and Zoning Commission.  Such appeal shall be in writing and shall state such reasons why the applicant feels the decision was in error.  The Commission will then forward their recommendation to the City Common Council.  Final action shall be taken by the City Council.  Uses are not subject to appeal in accord with ARS 9-466.06 H(1), but would be reviewed via text amendment process only. 
 
15.600 PERMITTED USES 
 
The permitted uses and conditional uses are those of the underlying primary zoning.  The design review guidelines below have been placed under general headings to facilitate their uses. 
 
15.700 SITE DEVELOPMENT 
 
1. A project should be developed to be compatible with the immediate environment of the site and to be sensitive to the surrounding neighborhood.  Clear grading of lots, especially large lots, should be avoided. 


 
2. Projects should be designed to minimize interference with the privacy, quiet and views of neighbors. 


 
3. Projects should be designed to minimize traffic problems. 


 
4. All developments shall have the buildings setback a minimum of ten (10) feet from the property line or the minimum distance required in the particular zoning district, whichever is greatest. 


 
5. Curb cuts on to Bank Street shall be limited.  The guidelines for access onto major arterial, minor arterial and collector streets as defined by the City of Kingman Streets and Sidewalks Development Rules and Regulations are as follows: 


 
a. No driveway onto a major arterial street or collector street shall be located closer than one-hundred (100) feet to the nearest intersecting curb line.  No driveway onto a major arterial street shall be located closer than two-hundred (200) feet to the nearest intersecting curb line.  If these minimum distances cannot be achieved due to existing property limits, the driveway shall be placed as far from the intersection as possible.  Commercial driveways that do not meet the minimum distance from the curb return may be restricted to right-in, right-out configurations.   


 
b. Where a corner lot abuts Bank Street and a collector or local side street, driveway access shall be permitted only on the non-arterial side street.  One driveway will be permitted when the frontage is less than three-hundred (300) feet.  Two (2) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is three-hundred (300) to six-hundred (600) feet.  Three (3) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is greater than six-hundred (600) feet.

8. Exterior lighting, when used, shall adhere to Section 34.000: OUTDOOR LIGHTING CODE, of the City Zoning Ordinance.  Exterior lights shall be shielded and filtered so as not to glare off-site into adjoining neighborhoods. 


 
9. There should be a pleasant transition from the street to the buildings.  This can be accomplished by the use of sidewalks, berms, transitional surfaces, and landscaping. 


 
10. The site organization of a project should take into consideration the arrangement of buildings in relation to open spaces, landscaping and the elements of adjacent sites. 


 
 
 
 
15.800 BUILDINGS 
 
The intent of the design review is to create architectural design quality, based on a common set of principles which include consideration of the unique environment, climate, and context of the Bank Street corridor setting in the City of Kingman.  A broad Southwestern style is the appropriate and desired architectural style in the Bank Street context, however, this style is not intended to limit architectural innovation within the general styles below.  These styles include: Southwestern Traditional, Arizona Territorial, Pueblo, and Spanish Colonial. 
 
1. Buildings shall be compatible with the colors and textures of the surrounding environment.  Warm earth tone colors shall be used, such as rustic reds, green earth tones, tans and browns.  This would not exclude the ability of a user to express a corporate logo or color as a minor element in the overall design. 


 
2. Highly reflective materials that create glare shall not be used.  Preferred exterior materials for the primary aspect of the building (front) facing the street shall be stucco, brick, adobe, natural stone, textured concrete, or textured and split face concrete masonry units.

21.000 HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENTS 
 
21.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE 
 
The section of the ordinance is intended to provide for the safe, orderly and reasonable use of hillside areas while protecting the public health, safety and welfare by: 
 
1. Determining whether certain types of soil conditions exist (such as loose or easily eroded soils, or rocky soils), and utilizing appropriate engineering technology to result in stable slopes during and subsequent to development. 


 
2. Reduction of water runoff and changes in the natural drainage patterns, soil erosion, and rock slides by minimizing grading and requiring revegetation. 


 
3. Permitting intensity of development compatible with the natural characteristics of hillside terrain, such as steepness of slope, significant landforms, soil suitability, and existing drainage patterns. 


 
4. Promoting cost effective public services by encouraging development in less steeply sloped areas, and ensuring adequate access for emergency vehicles. 


 
5. Protecting the public from damage and liability by ensuring that hillside development is of a sound and reasonable nature. 


 
21.200 APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS 
 
The previsions of this ordinance apply to all single-family, multiple-family and commercial development in areas meeting the criteria listed below.  In addition to these regulations, all other applicable development regulations of the Kingman Zoning Ordinance must also be met.  No industrial development shall be permitted on lots with an average cross slope of fifteen percent (15%) or greater. 
 
1. Any parcel of land within the City of Kingman with a fifteen percent (15%) or greater Average Cross Slope (ACS). 


 
2. Any parcel of land within the City of Kingman exhibiting a slope of twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, that has at least a ten (10) foot drop and runs parallel to one of the contour lines on the site topographic map for a distance of fifty (50) feet. 


 
3. Exceptions: 


 
a. Existing buildings and structures are exempted from meeting these regulations unless any proposed modifications result in an increase in floor area of fifty percent (50%) for residences and twenty-five percent (25%) for commercial buildings. 



 
   ACS = .0023 X (I) X (L)      I = contour interval, L = contour length, A = area 
       (A)                      ACS = Average Cross Slope 
 
Average Cross Slope is calculated by adding the length of each contour line on the site topographic map.  This length is converted to scale length in feet.  The sum of the lengths (L) of all contour lines is multiplied by the contour interval (1) in feet.  The result is multiplied by the factor .023, which converts the square footage of the scale map to acres.  This result is divided by the area (A) of the site in acres.  The answer to this formula is the Average Cross Slope (ACS).  (Refer to Figure 1 at the back of this section.) 
 
 
 
 
To determine if the property has any slopes that are higher than twenty-five percent (25%) drop more than ten (10) feet, and have a parallel length of over fifty (50) feet, first determine the change in elevation of all steep areas on the contour map of the parcel.  If these are more than ten (10) feet, draw a line perpendicular to the contour lines and determine the true distance between the high and low contour line.  Divide the change in elevation by the distance and multiply by one-hundred (100) to calculate the percent of slope.  If this is twenty five percent (25%) or higher, measure the length of the contour lines parallel to the slope.  If the true distance is of any one (1) of the contour lines if over fifty (50) feet, then these hillside regulations apply to that parcel.  (Refer to Figure 1 at the back of this section.) 
 
21.300 PROCESS 
 
These requirements are meant to provide for the administrative review of hillside developments.  The Planning Office will ensure compliance with these regulations, in addition to other requirements of the Kingman Zoning Ordinance, through the normal building permit application process. 
 
Any lot with a fifteen percent (15%) or greater ACS or any lot that has a slope of twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, that drops more than ten (10) feet, and has a parallel length of over fifty (50) feet, will be required to submit a topographic site plan at the time of building permit application.  (See example at back of this section.) 
 
The contour site plan should accurately depict the site prior to any grading and show lot dimensions, lot area, setbacks to property lines, principal building footprint, accessory structures, retaining walls, driveways, sidewalks, and total area proposed to be graded.  The site plan should be in a scale no smaller than one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet, with a contour interval of two (2) feet or less.  This eight-and-one-half inches by eleven inches (8 ½” x 11”) site plan must be prepared by a qualified Arizona registrant.  Larger lots may require larger drawings with smaller scales however, in no case may the scale be reduced below one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet. 
 
If all proposed grading is limited to areas of the property with less than fifteen percent (15%) slope, no other hillside requirements shall apply.  All applicable development regulations of the Kingman Zoning Ordinance must still be met. 
 
If areas with greater than fifteen percent (15%) slope are proposed to be graded, all of the following hillside requirements must be met. 
 
21.400 REQUIREMENTS 
 
21.410 GRADING AND FILL 
 
1. A grading and drainage plan shall be submitted in accord with Chapter 33 of the 1994 Uniform Building Code and City of Kingman Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article II, Sections, 5 – 19.  A grading permit or building permit must be submitted and approved prior to any earth moving work commencing on the site, unless specifically exempted by Sections, 5 – 19 of the City of Kingman Code of Ordinances.  Failure to obtain a grading permit or building permit prior to starting earth moving work on a site shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. 


 
2. The percentage of the lot permitted to be graded shall be determined by the Average Cross Slope, with more grading allowed on less steep slopes, as outlined in Table 1. 


 
3. The remaining portion of the lot not graded is to be maintained in an undisturbed state, maintaining natural topography and vegetation. 


 
4. All areas graded, and not covered with an impervious surface, are to be revegetated with native based, drought tolerant landscaping materials to minimize the threat of erosion and 


stabilize slopes.  The density of landscaping materials should approximate what existed prior to any grading.  Revegetation shall be completed within six months of initial grading. 


 
5. The slope of a cut or fill surface shall not exceed fifty percent (50%). 


 
6. The vertical fill height shall not exceed the vertical height of the cut, and both cut and fill shall not exceed eight (8) feet individually of sixteen (16) feet total. 


 
7. Cut and fill slopes are to be setback from the site boundaries as follows; 


 
a. Top of cut slopes shall be no nearer to any property line than one fifth (1/5) of the vertical height of the cut, with the minimum specified by the zoning designation. 


 
b. Toe of fill slope shall be no nearer to any property line than one half (1/2) the height of the slope with the minimum specified by the zoning designation. 


 
8. Driveways slopes are not to exceed sixteen percent (16%) and shall provide adequate access for emergency vehicles. 


 
9. The entrance and exit points and continuity of all natural drainage channels on hillside sites shall be preserved.

29.000 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS 
 
29.100 PURPOSE AND INTENT 
 
Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S) Article 6.1, Section 9-462.01, within individual zones, there may be uses permitted on a conditional basis under which additional requirements for development must be met.  The purpose of the Conditional Use Permit is to allow integration of uses into the community, which may only be suitable in specific locations, or because of unusual operational or physical characteristics that require special consideration, or only if such uses are designed, or developed to assure maximum compatibility with adjoining uses. 
 
Conditions may be applied to the issuance of the permit such that the proposed land use would not be detrimental to persons residing or working in the vicinity, to adjacent property, to the neighborhood or to the public welfare in general.  Under no circumstances shall any of the conditions of development be reduced below the minimum standards that are imposed upon any permitted land use within a given zoning district.  A Conditional Use Permit may be granted only for those land uses expressly listed as such, and only after the Planning Commission has made a recommendation and the Common Council has authorized such use as evidenced by resolution. 
 
29.200 AUTHORITY 
 
The City of Kingman Common Council as the City’s governing body retains final authority to approve, deny, approve with conditions or modified conditions, all applications for a Conditional Use Permit. 
 
29.300 PROCEDURE 
 
1. Application:  Prior to making a formal application for a Conditional Use Permit, the applicant or agent is encouraged to review their proposal with a member of the Planning Staff.  Application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made by the property owner, or their authorized agent, on a form, available from the City Planning Department.  Application shall include: a site plan, a list of the names and addresses of all property owners within one-hundred-fifty (150) feet of the proposed conditional use and a non-refundable application fee. 


 
2. Public Hearing Required:  Two (2) public hearings shall be held on all Conditional Use Permit cases.  The first hearing will be held before the Planning and Zoning Commission.  The second hearing shall be held before the Mayor and the Common Council.  Notice of the time and place of the hearing, including a general explanation and the general location of the matter to be considered, shall be given at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing in the following manner: 


 
a. The public notice display advertisement of not less than two inches by three inches (2” x 3”) in size shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Kingman and surrounding area.  The public notice will provide information about the date, time and place of the proposed Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council hearings.  A public notice poster shall be posted on the property in question in at least one (1) location. If the property is less than one (1) acre.  If the subject property is greater than one (1) acre, a minimum of two (2) notices will be posted.  Posted notices will be placed in such location as to afford the public the best opportunity to see the notice.  In some cases, the location affording the best opportunity for public view may be in front of or beyond the actual boundaries of the property being proposed for a conditional use.  The notice shall include the present zoning classification, the proposed use and the date and time of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Common Council public hearings, as well as a location and phone number from which additional information can be received. 


 
 
 
b. In proceedings involving Conditional Use Permit applications which abut other municipalities or unincorporated areas, or combinations thereof, copies of the notice of public hearing shall be transmitted to the planning agency of such governmental unit.  Additionally, the City shall send a written notice by United States Postal Service mail, notifying those property owners of record according to the most recent Mohave County Assessors rolls within one-hundred-fifty (150) feet of any point of the property on which the proposed conditional use might occur.  The notice will describe the proposed conditional use, will include a map, and will state that public comment is encouraged during the public hearing. 


 
c. In the case of Conditional Use Permits that are not initiated by the property owner, notice by first class mail shall be sent to each property owner of record in the manner described above, within three-hundred (300) feet of any point of the property on which the proposed conditional use might occur. 


 
d. Notwithstanding the notice requirements set forth herein, the failure of any person or entity to receive notice shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the actions of a municipality for which notice was given. 


 
3. Planning Commission Public Hearing and Action:  The Planning Commission shall review a written report presented by staff concerning the conditional use request.  The applicant, or designated representative, should be present to explain the conditional use request.  Adjacent land owners and all other potentially affected citizens will be provided an opportunity to express an opinion on any issue or concern they may have with the proposed conditional use prior to the hearing or during the hearing.  Such persons may submit oral or written comments or testimony that can be presented to the Commission.  The Planning Commission will discuss the conditional use proposal and, based on the evidence submitted and its own study and knowledge of the circumstances involved may recommend approval of the conditional use request with specified conditions or may recommend denial.  After the hearing, the Planning Commission shall present a written recommendation to the Common Council.  The Commission’s written recommendation to approve or deny shall contain the reasons or findings upon which its decision is based. 


 
4. Council Public Hearing and Action:  The Common Council shall hold a second, separate public hearing from the Planning Commission.  The Council may take testimony and may consider matters not necessarily heard by the Commission.  The Common Council may adopt, modify, or reject the Commission recommendation based upon the information they receive at the public hearing.  The Council may also return the request to the Planning Commission for further consideration of issues as directed by the Council.  The Common Council may sustain a Planning Commission recommendation of denial of a conditional use request.  If the Council wishes to approve a conditional use request recommended for denial by the Commission, the Council may direct the preparation of a Resolution for consideration at the next Council meeting.  The Council shall not change the requested conditional use to another conditional use without public notice and another hearing in accord with the procedures in this section.  The Council may not increase the area of the conditional use request without additional public notice. 


 
5. Council Decision:  The decision of the City Council on the Conditional Use Permit shall be final and shall become effective by resolution immediately.  Notice of the decision shall be mailed to the property owner and/or applicant at the address shown on the application.  No conditional use case that is the same or substantially the same (in site size, intensity or text) as a request that has been denied shall be filed within one (1) year of the date of the Planning Commission decision. 


 
 
 
 
29.310 REQUIRED FINDINGS 
 
In order to make recommendations on a Conditional Use Permit, the Planning Commission should make findings based on the following elements as applies to that particular case:

The legislative body of the City, (the Mayor and Common Council), has adopted the following citizen review and participation process that applies to all rezoning cases.  By law and policy the rezoning process is designed to give the greatest opportunity possible for citizen participation in such a public process.  In the event of doubt regarding participation, more, not less public participation shall be the standard.  
 
The purpose of the citizen participation process is to: 
 
1. Ensure that applicants pursue early and effective citizen participation in conjunction with their applications, giving them the opportunity to understand and try to mitigate any real or perceived impacts their application may have on the community; 
 
2. Ensure that the citizens and property owners of Kingman have an adequate opportunity to learn about applications that may affect them and to work with applicants to resolve concerns at an early stage of the process; and  
 
3. Facilitate ongoing communications between the applicant, interested citizens and property owners, City staff, and elected officials throughout the application review process. 
 
The citizen participation plan is not intended to produce complete consensus on all applications, but to encourage applicants to be good neighbors and to allow for informed decision making. 
 
The process includes the following elements: 
 
1. Two public hearings will be held on all rezoning cases and proposed text amendments.  The first hearing will be before the Planning and Zoning Commission.  The second hearing will be before the Mayor and Common Council.

A written notice on any proposed rezoning will be sent by first-class United States Postal Service mail to all property owners of record according to the most recent Mohave County Assessors rolls, within a minimum of 300 feet of any point of the property being proposed for rezoning.  The notice will describe the proposed action, will include a map, and will state that public comment is encouraged before or during the public hearing.  Other notices may be sent beyond the above described radii, if a person places his or her name on the notification list and pays $5.00 a year. 


 
3. A public notice poster, giving the time, date and location of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Common Council public hearings, will be posted on the property in question in at least one location, if the property is less than one acre, at least 15 days before the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing.  If the property which is the subject of the rezoning request is greater than one acre, a minimum of two notices will be posted.  Posted notices will be placed in such location as to afford the public the best opportunity to see the notice.  In some cases the location affording the best opportunity to see the notice.  In some cases the location affording the best opportunity for public view may be in front of or beyond the actual boundaries of the property being proposed for rezoning.  The posted notice shall be printed so that the following are visible from a distance of one hundred feet: the word "zoning", the present zoning district classification, the proposed zoning district classification and the date and time of the hearing and state a location and phone number from which additional information can be received. 


 
A public notice, display advertisement of not less than one-eighth page in size shall be published at least once in the newspaper of general circulation in the City of Kingman and surrounding area.  The notice will be published not less than 15 days before the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing and will provide information about the date, time and place of the proposed Common Council hearing, which will be held at least 10 days after the Commission hearing. 
 
4. Adjacent land owners and all other potentially affected citizens will be provided an opportunity to express an opinion on any issue or concern they may have with the proposed rezoning prior to the hearing or during the hearing.  Such persons may submit oral or written comments or testimony that can be presented to the Commission or Common Council. 
 
5. In proceedings involving rezoning of land which abuts other municipalities or unincorporated areas of the county or a combination thereof, copies of the notices of the public hearing shall be transmitted to the Planning Agency of such governmental unit such land. 
 
6. In addition to notice by publication, mailed notices and property postings, the City of Kingman, and its Planning and Zoning Commission reserve the right to give notice of the hearing in such other manner as it may be deemed necessary in the public interest.  The Commission always encourages any person proposing a rezoning to contact surrounding property owners or neighbors to ascertain and possibly address issues and concerns before the public hearings.  Such contacts could include neighborhood meetings or other methods of address citizen comments. 
 
31.300 RECOMMENDATION OF THE PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION

 B. That the property involved in the proposed change of zoning district designation is more suitable for the purposes permitted in the proposed change of zone than is permitted in the present zone classification. 
 
 C. That the proposed change of zoning district designation would not be detrimental in any way to persons or property in the surrounding area, nor to the community in general.

The Planning and Zoning Commission may also recommend a lesser intensity zoning of the same type requested.  However, the Planning and Zoning Commission may not increase the intensity of the noticed request without a new public hearing with proper notice given in accord with this Section. 
 
31.420 PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION’S RECOMMENDATION 
 
The Commission in its consideration of any request for a change of zone may recommend to the City Council that if certain conditions concerning the development of the subject property and adjoining streets are first met, that said property would then be suitable for a change of zone. 
 
The Common Council may approve a change of zone conditioned upon a schedule for development of the specified use or uses for which rezoning is requested.  If at the expiration of the period the property has not been improved for the use for which it was conditionally approved, the legislative body, after notification by certified mail to the owner and applicant who requested the rezoning, shall schedule a public hearing to take administrative action to extend, remove, or determine compliance with the schedule for development or take legislative action to cause the property to revert to its former zoning classification.

The Common Council may also return the request to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration of issues as directed by the Common Council.  Any Common Council modification to the requested official zoning map or zoning ordinance text  amendment may include: reducing the area on the Official Zoning Map to be amended, modifying conditions of the rezoning request, or reducing the zoning district amendment to a less intense zoning district; or in the case of a zoning text amendment, reduce the intensity of the amendment.  
 
The Common Council may sustain a Planning and Zoning Commission denial of a zoning case.  If the Common Council wishes to approve a zoning case that the Planning and Zoning Commission recommended denial, the Common Council shall direct the preparation of an Ordinance for consideration at the next Council meeting. 
 
The Common Council shall not change any property from the requested zoning district classification requested in the application to another zoning district classification that imposes any regulations not imposed by the zoning district requested or that removes or modifies any such regulations previously imposed on the property without following the procedure specified in Section 31.200 of this ordinance.  
 
No rezoning or conditional use permit case that is the same or substantially the same (in site size or intensity or text) as a request which has been denied by the Common Council or was overturned by referendum shall be filed within one (1) year of the date of the Common Council’s decision or referendum vote, whichever is greater.  
 
31.600 PROTEST PROVISION 
 
In the event that the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of the property by area and number of lots, tracts and condominium units within the zoning area of the affected property file a written protest against a proposed amendment, the change shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the City Council.  If any members of the City Council are unable to vote on such a question because of a conflict of interest, then the required number of votes for passage of the question shall be three-fourths of the remaining membership of the City Council, provided that such required number of votes shall in no event be less than a majority of the full City Council. For purposes of this section, the vote shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.  A protest filed pursuant to this section shall be signed by the property owners opposing the proposed amendment and filed with the City of Kingman Office of the City Clerk, no later than 12:00 noon one business day before the date set for the City Council hearing on the proposed amendment. For purposes of this section, “zoning area,” means the area within one hundred fifty (150) feet, including all rights-of-way, of the affected property subject to the proposed amendment or change and the area of the proposed amendment or change. 
 
31.700 CLASSIFICATION OF NEW ADDITIONS 
 
All new additions and annexations of land to the City of Kingman shall be zoning classifications which permit densities and uses no greater than those permitted by the county immediately before annexation. Subsequent changes in zoning of the annexed territory shall be made as specified in this Chapter for the rezoning of land.  
 
 
 
 
 
31.800 ADMINISTRATIVELY IMPOSED DEDICATIONS OR EXACTIONS 
 
It is the policy of the City of Kingman that exactions and/or dedications requirements are made only when there is a direct, rational relationship (rough proportionality) between the increase in density and/or intensity of a development and their exaction and dedication. 
 
Exactions and dedications are required by the City of Kingman only through the final actions of the Common Council action on rezoning cases or conditional use cases.  Dedications and/or exactions will be clearly outlined in either an ordinance for a rezoning case or resolution for a conditional use case and will be in rough proportionality to the project impacts.  These will not be calculated with mathematical precision but will be shown to be direct and rational relationships. 
 
The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the Common Council a necessary dedication and/or exaction that is rationally related to the increase in intensity or density or as may be reasonably required for public, health, safety and welfare.  Property owners will not be asked to bear a burden far beyond that which the development impacts the community. 
 
Administrative agencies of the City of Kingman, including but not limited to the Planning, Engineering, Building Safety, or Public Works Departments are not authorized to require a dedication or exaction as a condition of obtaining a building permit without an express authorization in ordinance or resolution as appropriate.

35.000 OVERLAY DISTRICT: DESIGN REVIEW MANUAL FOR THE HUALAPAI MOUNTAIN ROAD AREA PLAN 
 
35.100 PURPOSE 
 
This Design Review Manual is established to provide general development performance standards for the study areas covered by the Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan.  These standards are intended and designed to aid in the implementation of the Area Plan; to encourage sound design principals; to assure the compatibility of uses; to encourage attractive appearances; to prevent blight; and to promote and enhance the health, safety and general welfare of the residents in the community. 
 
This manual establishes minimum standards.  The City encourages developers and landowners to exceed these minimums whenever possible. 
 
35.200 INTRODUCTION 
 
The 1988 Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan required the development of a Design Review Manual to be used in conjunction with the Area Plan.  The City does not propose to establish a specific theme, but rather encourages high quality and creative developments that are architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and the colors and textures of the surrounding environment. 
 
During the design review process, the City will be looking at more than just a building’s design.  A project’s layout, its relationship to the immediate neighborhood and its relationship to the entire study areas will also be examined.  Special considerations are given to sign, landscaping, screening and setback requirements which are more specific than the City’s Zoning Ordinance.  It should be understood that the City Staff does not solve design problems for the applicant. 
 
The design review guidelines have been placed under general headings to facilitate their uses. 
 
35.300 APPLICABILITY 
 
The standards set forth in this Manual shall apply to: 
 
1. Hualapai Mountain Road, all development (commercial and residential). 


 
2. All commercial developments. 


 
3. The future Parkway/collector street (located along the West section line of Sections 15 and 22, and along the east section line of Sections 16 and 21), all development (commercial and residential). 


 
35.400 PROCEDURE 
 
The review will be done in-house by the City Planning Staff.  Currently the Planning Staff reviews all preliminary and final subdivision plats, parcel plats, site plans/building permits, sign permits, variance requests, rezoning requests, conditional use permit requests, business license applications, and general plan/area plan amendment requests.  The Mohave County Planning Department refers certain development proposals for land adjacent to the City limits to the City Planning Staff for review.  For Section 16, the State Urban Land, the State Land Department will refer all development proposals to the City Staff for their review and comment.  In this manner, City Planning Staff will be able to check development in the study areas for their adherence to the design review guidelines. 
 
A checklist or required design review elements (see Exhibit 1) shall be filled out and attached to all project reviews that are subject to these guidelines.  This in-house procedure should minimize extra paperwork 
and any time delays for project reviews.  Any decision or finding made on any element in Exhibit 1, shall be given to the applicant in writing with reasons for such decision or finding. 
 
All developments within the City limits must comply with all other applicable provisions of Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and all other relevant City regulations.  Where conflicts occur, the more restrictive regulations will be applied.  All developments outside of the City limits must adhere to the applicable Mohave County regulations.  This Design Review Manual, along with the Hualapai Mountain Road Area Plan, gives City Staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Common Council, a basis upon which to make policy and procedural recommendations to Mohave County and the State Land Department for the lands which are included in the Area Plan, but which lie outside of the City limits. 
 
It is recommended that anyone who is considering a development project within the study areas should make an appointment with City Planning Staff for preliminary discussions and review.  This pre-development conference can help reduce errors and omissions and can alleviate potential problems before final plans are drawn up. 
 
35.500 APPEALS 
 
Appeals from any decision made during the in-house review shall be made to the City Planning and Zoning Commission.  Such appeal shall be in writing and shall state such reasons why the applicant feels the decision was in error.  The Commission will then forward their recommendation to the City Common Council.  Final action shall be taken by the City Council. 
 
35.600 SITE DEVELOPMENT 
 
1. A project should be developed to be compatible with the immediate environment of the site and to be sensitive to the surrounding neighborhood.  Damage to the natural environment should be minimized.  Clear grading of lots, especially large lots, should be avoided.

Commercial driveways that do not meet the minimum distance from the curb return may be restricted to right-in, right-out driveway configurations. 


 
 
b. Access to and from Hualapai Mountain Road and Mission Blvd. and collector streets should be limited to street intersections.  Where a corner lot abuts Hualapai Mountain Road or Mission Boulevard and a collector or local side street, driveway access shall be permitted only on the non-arterial side street. One (1) driveway will be permitted when the frontage is less than three-hundred (300) feet.  Two (2) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is three-hundred (300) to six-hundred (600) feet.  Three (3) driveways will be permitted when the frontage is greater than six-hundred (600) feet.

36.340 BUILDING HEIGHT 
 
Not to exceed fifty (50) feet. Churches, schools, hospital, sanitariums and other public and semi-public buildings may exceed 50-feet if the minimum depth of required rear yards and the minimum width of the required side yards required are increased one (1) foot for each two (2) feet by which the height of such public and semi-public structure exceeds the prescribed height limit. 
 
 
36.350 DISTANCE BETWEEN BUILDINGS 
 
Buildings not actually adjoining shall be provided with a minimum six (6) foot separation. 
 
36.360 OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING

Said wall shall be reduced to thirty-six (36) inches in height within a required front yard of the adjacent residential property.  In the case where the developed commercial lot abuts an undeveloped residential district, which has been identified as having commercial potential by an approved land use plan, the masonry wall requirement may be deferred until such time as the abutting lot is developed in a residential manner.  At this point in time, the owner of the abutting commercial property shall have six (6) months, from the date of Certificate of Occupancy for the residence is issued, to construct the required masonry wall.  If there is a dedicated alley or public roadway separating the commercial property from the residential property, the alley or public roadway shall serve as the buffer and the masonry wall shall not be required unless so specified by ordinance relating to the rezoning of the subject property.

1.12  RESUBDIVISION OF LAND  
 
(1) Procedure for Resubdivision

Any map of a subdivision that has been filed for record may be amended to correct an error in any course or distance or other necessary item that was omitted therefrom, or to correct a drafting, graphic, technical, or similar type error, by the filing for record of an amended map of said subdivisions.  The City Engineer shall examine such amended map, and if such examination disclosed that the only changes on the amended are changes authorized above, he shall certify this to be a fact over his signature on the amended map.  Thereafter, the amended map shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the Mohave County Recorder in which the original subdivision map was recorded.  Such map shall be marked “AMENDED MAP OF________”.   Subsequently, if more than one amended map is necessary, the successive maps shall be titled “SECOND AMENDED MAP OF ________”, and follow in numerical sequence.  The use of the terminology of Amended Map shall not be used to change or vary or add any lot lines, streets or easements, or statement that were not contained on the approved final plat, since such actions necessitate reprocessing of the plat.

(2) If no lots in a subdivision, for which a final plat has been approved and recorded, have been sold within five (5) years from the date of recordation, or if none of the improvements have been made in accordance with the assurance for completion of improvements, the Common Council may on its own motion hold a public hearing after notice to determine whether the approval of such Final Plat should be revoked.  Such revocation shall be effective upon recordation of a certified copy of such resolutions; and thereupon, all streets, rights-of-way 


and easements dedicated or offer for dedication by such plat shall be of no further force or effect.  


  
(3) When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided by all the owners of lots in such plat, by petitioning the Common Council for consideration of the revocation of all or portions of the plat.

(2) When a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or major street, the Common Council may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:  
  
a.  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the major arterial or minor arterial and front onto a parallel local street; no driveway or vehicle access shall be provided from the major arterial or minor arterial to a residential lot, and a six (6) foot fence shall be constructed along the rear property line of such lots.  
  
b.  A marginal access or service road separated from the major arterial or minor arterial and having access thereto a suitable point.  
  
(3)  In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvements to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the design criteria for roads in Table One and Table Two of these regulations are required.  Any proposed deviation from the design criteria shall be approved by the City Engineer.  
  
(4) The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the General Plan, Kingman Area Transportation Study, and Street and Sidewalks Development Rules and Regulations with due consideration to their relations to existing and other planned streets, to topographical conditions relating to drainage in and through the subdivision, to public convenience and safety, and appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets.

(3) Service of the notice to abate shall be deemed complete on the date it is hand delivered or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the property owner or responsible party. If personal service or mailed service is not practicable, service of notice also shall be deemed effective upon notification through a one time public notice published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city and by posting a duplicate notice on the property for a period of thirty (30) days.

(a) Emergency abatement.

(1) Imminent hazard. If a situation presents an imminent hazard to life or public safety or immediate likelihood of physical harm, the city manager may approve an emergency notice and order to take immediate action as is appropriate to correct or abate the condition. In addition, or instead, the city manager may approve immediate action on the part of city officials to summarily and unilaterally correct or abate the condition or authorize the commencement of an action in superior court to enjoin the responsible party to abate the imminent hazard. The inability of city officials to find or contact the responsible party, despite reasonable efforts to do so, in no way affects the city’s right or obligation under this section to summarily and unilaterally correct or abate the condition.

(2) Notice. Service of the declaration shall be complete upon delivery to the occupant, posting in an obvious and conspicuous place on the premises and upon mailing by certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at his or her last known address.

(3) Appeal and stay. The occupant or owner of the property may appeal the declaration and order to vacate to the municipal court by delivering to the court clerk a written statement of appeal within five (5) days after service is complete. Timely delivery of a written statement of appeal operates as a stay on the order to vacate until the appeal can be heard. The appeal shall be heard and a determination made by the city magistrate or hearing officer within five (5) days.

(4) Violation; removal of posting. Once a building or structure has been declared unfit for human habitation, it shall be a violation of this article to remove the posted notice unless and until it has been determined by the city that the conditions warranting the posting have been abated or the city magistrate or hearing officer has ruled in favor of the responsible party on appeal.

(5) Reoccupancy. Once a building has become unoccupied as the result of a notice and order to vacate under this section, it shall remain unoccupied until reinspected and approved for occupancy by the city.

(2) The quality of the cable operator’s service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices has been reasonable in light of community needs (but without regard to the mix or quality, of cable services or other services provided over the system).

(3) The cable operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment in its proposal; and

(4) The cable operator’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting the needs and interests.

(Ord. No. 1582, § 1, 7-16-07)


Sec. 10-23 Transfers.

(a) The rights granted under the license may not be transferred, assigned, sublet or subdivided in any way or through any mechanism, including a sale or lease of the cable system or a sale or change in the control of the licensee without the express prior permission of the city, except as otherwise provided under federal law.

The word “transfer” as used herein means a transaction in which control of the licensee is transferred from one person or group of persons acting in concert with another person or another group of persons acting in concert. “Control” for purposes of this section shall mean majority voting control of the licensee; provided that, any financing arrangement, including but not limited to a mortgage or pledge, shall not be deemed a “transfer.”

(Ord. No. 1582, § 1, 7-16-07)


Sec. 10-24 Revocation or termination of license.

(a) A license may be revoked by the city on the recommendation of the city manager and with the approval of the council, for failure to construct, operate, or maintain the cable system as required by this article or the license agreement, or for some other material breach of this article or the license agreement. If the city has issued a license specifically conditioned upon the completion of construction or other specific obligations by a specified date under subsection 10-9(c), failure of the licensee to complete construction or comply with other specific obligations as required will result in the automatic forfeiture of the license without further action by the city. However, the city, at its discretion and for good cause shown by the licensee, may grant an extension of time. The city must give a licensee written notice that it is in material breach of this article or the license agreement. If the licensee does not correct the breach within thirty (30) days of the notice, or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the licensee of its intent to revoke the license. The city must give the licensee written notice of the basis for a revocation, stating its reasons.

(b) The council must hold a public hearing, and then determine by written resolution whether or not to revoke the license based the recommendations of the city manager, information presented at the public hearing, and other evidence in the record. The resolution must include reasons for the council’s decision.

(c) The city may revoke any license one hundred twenty (120) days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the licensee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. The city must hold a public hearing before revoking a license under this subsection. The city may not revoke a license under this subsection if, during the one hundred twenty-day period:

(1) The assignment, receivership, or trusteeship is vacated; or

(2) The assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this article and the license agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by the court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms, and conditions of the license.

(d) The city may revoke the license if there is a foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a licensee, by serving notice on the licensee and the successful bidder at the sale. The license and all rights and privileges of the license will be revoked thirty (30) days after the city serves notice under this subsection unless:

(1) The city has approved a transfer of the license; and by the terms and conditions of the license.

(2) The successful bidder has agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the license.

(e) If the city revokes a license, or if for any other reason a licensee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers, the city may:

(1) Require the former licensee to remove its facilities and equipment at the licensee’s or surety’s expense, or at the expense of both, after determining that the cable system cannot be economically maintained and operated;

(2) Acquire ownership of the cable system at an equitable market price on the recommendation of the city manager and with the approval of the council;

(3) After a public hearing, sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the assets of a cable system abandoned by a licensee for the best price offer obtainable. However, the legal, character, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the purchaser must meet city approval. The city must pay any consideration received in excess of the city’s costs, and after other creditors and subscriber claims have been satisfied, to the original licensee.

(Ord. No. 1582, § 1, 7-16-07)


Sec. 10-25 Continuity of service mandatory.

It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services from the licensee if their financial and other obligations to the licensee are satisfied.

(a) If the license is terminated, the licensee must do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service. The licensee must cooperate with the city to operate the system for a transition period following termination as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The transition period must not exceed twelve (12) months without the licensee’s written consent. During the transition period, the cable system must be operated under terms and conditions to which the city and the licensee agree, or on such other terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.

(b) If the licensee discontinues service to its subscribers without city approval, the license may be terminated immediately, and the city may take possession of all facilities and property, real and personal, related to the cable system for the purpose of operating the system. The city may undertake such operation itself or authorize operation by a contractor.

(Ord. No. 1582, § 1, 7-16-07)
