PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Skokie, Illinois. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant State law have been included. A table listing the State law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between Sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Barbara Meyer, Corporation Counsel, Mark Vanderpool, Assistant Village Manager, Keith Glatz, Purchasing Agent, and Marlene Williams, Village Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Village's affairs.

(1)  "Unavailable" means either that a vacancy in office exists, or that the lawful incumbent of the office is unable to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the office. 
(2)  "Emergency interim successor" means a person designated pursuant to this Section, in the event the officer is unavailable to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of an office or until a successor is appointed or elected and qualified as may be provided by the constitution, statutes, charters and ordinances or until the lawful incumbent is able to resume the exercise of the powers and discharge of the duties. 
(3)  "Disaster" means a situation in which an occurrence or threat of catastrophic and widespread injury or loss of life or property resulting from any natural or manmade cause, including but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, epidemic and explosion.

(3)  If the vacancy is determined to be temporary, then the vacancy shall be filled in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.

(e)  Permanent vacancy. In the event a permanent vacancy occurs in any of the offices of Mayor, Clerk or Trustee during, or as the result of, a disaster, and a quorum of the Mayor and Board of Trustees is not possible, then one or more emergency interim successor(s) shall automatically succeed to the office of Trustee until there are a sufficient number of the Mayor, if available, and Trustees, including emergency interim successors serving as Trustees, to achieve a quorum. Upon achieving a quorum, the Mayor and Board of Trustees shall fill any and all permanent vacancies, including any vacancy for which an emergency interim successor is serving, in accordance with Section 3.1-5-5 of the Illinois Municipal Code and Chapter 2 of the Skokie Village Code.

The Village Manager or designee is authorized to waive the certificate of appropriateness requirement if a determination is made that no external architectural feature is involved or the work is minor in nature for which the building permit is sought. 
(b)  Preliminary consideration of certificate of appropriateness. A petitioner may receive a preliminary design critique from the Commission by presenting an abbreviated submission. This submission must adequately portray the design concept and its relationship to adjacent properties, but it need not include all of the items required for complete certificate of appropriateness consideration.

Upon the filing of an application for a building permit for which a certificate of Appropriateness is required, the Village Manager or designee shall immediately transmit the application to the Appearance Commission.

The Commission shall hold hearings at least once a month on a fixed, predetermined day or date. Upon such hearing the Commission shall consider the application and if necessary receive additional evidence (such as exterior elevation renderings) from the applicant or the applicant's agent or attorney. 
(d)  Action by Commission. The Commission shall make its decision at the meeting which the case is heard, unless the case is continued to another date, at which time a decision shall be rendered. The Commission shall issue to the Director of Community Development a certificate of appropriateness, unless the Commission finds that the plan does not conform to the appearance plan and that the proposed building, structure, sign, awning/canopy or landscaping will be inappropriate to or incompatible with the character of the immediate neighborhood or cause substantial depreciation in property values or does not comply with other Village codes or ordinances. 
(e)  Approval by Commission. The Commission shall approve a certificate of appropriateness upon the concurring vote of the majority of the Commission members present. 
(f)  Appeal from decisions of Commission. All final decisions of the Appearance Commission under this section shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq., except that cases under site plan approval or involving a planned development, as provided for in the Village Zoning Ordinance, may be reviewed by the Mayor and Board of Trustees. 
(g)  Follow-up by Director of Community Development. Upon the granting of a certificate of appropriateness, the exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and materials upon which the certificate was granted shall be turned over to the Director of Community Development, whose responsibility it shall be to determine, from time to time, that the project is in progress and, finally, upon its completion, that there have been no unauthorized deviations from the evidence upon which the granting of the certificate of appropriateness was originally based. The Director of Community Development and Appearance Commission chair may, after the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, approve minor changes in a project.

(a)  Generally. The Administrative Law Officer shall issue orders or judgments in accordance with Section 2-1072(b). 
(b)  Respondent's failure to comply with the Code or other ordinance. Upon determining a Respondent liable for violation of the Code or other ordinance, the Administrative Law Officer may order the Respondent to comply with the Code or other ordinance within a specified period of time. If the Respondent fails to do so, the Administrative Law Officer, upon the request of the Village, may then authorize the Village to take the necessary actions to cause the property owned, or controlled, by Respondent, to come into compliance with the Code or other ordinance. In such case, the Respondent shall be liable for any and all costs incurred by the Village. The provisions of Section 2-1072(11), (12) and (13) shall be applicable. 
(c)  Compliance bond. In order to ensure that Code or ordinance violations are remedied or fines are paid in a timely manner, an Administrative Law Officer, upon issuing a final determination of liability, may require a Respondent to post with the Village a compliance bond. Whenever it is necessary for the Village to make repairs or otherwise expend funds relating to a Code or ordinance violation for which a bond was posted after a Respondent has exhausted or failed to exhaust judicial review procedures, the Administrative Law Officer may, after giving the parties notice and opportunity to be heard, issue an order permitting the Village to draw against the bond in an appropriate amount. The Administrative Law Officer shall order the bond, less the costs incurred by the Village, returned to the Respondent upon proof of compliance with the applicable Code provisions and the payment of applicable fines or costs. 
(d)  Supplemental hearing. In the event a Respondent has failed to comply with a judgment ordering a Respondent to: (1) comply with the Code or other ordinance; (2) pay any costs incurred by the Village in enforcing the judgment; or (3) pay a fine or penalty, then the Village may, upon proper notice to Respondent, request the Administrative Law Officer to enter an order enforcing the prior judgment. Once determined and fixed by the Administrative Law Officer, the unpaid amount shall be considered a debt due and owing the Village. This debt may be collected in accordance with all applicable law. 
Subsequent to the Administrative Law Officer determining and fixing the amount owed the Village, the Village may cause a lien to be recorded on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the Respondent in the amount of the debt due and owing the Village. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e)  Violations of orders. Any person, having received notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided in this article, who knowingly fails to comply with an order or judgment issued by an Administrative Law Officer under this article, including the issuance of a subpoena, shall, if the order or judgment is not stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to its effective date, be guilty of contempt. Contempt shall be punishable as provided in Section 1-6 for each offense. Each day that the violation continues shall be considered a separate and distinct offense. In a prosecution under this section, it shall not be a defense that a person came into compliance with an order or judgment, sought judicial review of it, or made efforts to comply with an order or judgment, subsequent to its effective date.

Sec. 2-1094. - Violation notice. 
A violation notice shall be issued for a violation of a regulation referred to in Section 2-1093. A violation notice may be commonly referred to as a ticket or citation and such reference shall not affect the enforcement of the violation notice. 
(a)  A violation notice shall, at a minimum, state the following information: 
(1)  The date, time and place of the violation; 
(2)  The specific regulation violated; 
(3)  The fine that is assessed; 
(4)  The vehicle make; 
(5)  The state registration number of the vehicle, or if no registration number is available, then the vehicle identification number; 
(6)  The maximum amount that can be imposed including late penalties; and 
(7)  The Village identification number of the person issuing the notice. 
(b)  Whenever any vehicle is in violation of the standing, parking or compliance regulations listed in Section 2-1093, except for seat belt or child passenger protection statutes, each and every owner of the vehicle shall be prima facie liable and responsible for the violation and subject to the applicable fine and penalties for late payments. An owner shall be known as a "Respondent." Any police officer, parking enforcement officer or other person so designated by the Village Manager, who observes a violation may issue a violation notice. The violation notice shall be served on the owner of the vehicle by affixing it to the vehicle, or by handing the violation notice to the operator of the vehicle, if an operator is present. 
(c)  Whenever any operator or passenger is in violation of section 2-1093 for violation of seat belt requirements stated in Section 12-603.1 of the IVC or the Child Passenger Protection Act, the violation notice shall be served on the person in violation of the regulations by handing the notice to that person. The person identified in the violation notice for violating said statutes shall be known as the "Respondent." 
(d)  Whenever any vehicle is determined to have committed an Automated Traffic Law Violation, each and every owner of the vehicle shall be prima facie liable and responsible for the violation and subject to the applicable fine and penalties for late payments.

(e)  Whenever any vehicle or trailer is observed in violation of the regulation requiring the purchase or proper display of a Village wheel tax license, issuance and service of the violation notice shall be accomplished in the same manner and method specified in paragraph (b) of this Section. 
(f)  The Village's Director of Finance, or designee, is authorized to make a comparison of the list of vehicles or trailers registered to owners having an address in the Village, as provided by the records of the Secretary of State, to the list of vehicles or trailers that have purchased a Village wheel tax license. In the event the Director, or designee, determines that there is a vehicle or trailer registered to an owner having an address in the Village, but a valid or current Village wheel tax license for the vehicle or trailer has not been purchased in compliance with this Code, then the Director or designee shall issue a violation notice on each and every owner of the vehicle or trailer. This notice shall be served by first class mail or in person. 
(g)  The failure to name a specific owner on a violation notice does not relieve an unnamed owner from being liable or responsible for the violation, nor does it affect enforceability of the violation notice against any owner. The Village may seek to collect all fines and late penalties from any owner whether or not that owner was named on the violation notice, provided, however, that should an owner pay a fine and late penalties, the Village may not collect the same fine or late penalties from another owner. 
(h)  The person issuing and serving a violation notice shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service, or in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the Administrator attesting to the correctness of all violation notices produced by the device while it was under the person's control.

(i)  The original or a copy of the violation notice, or a printed record of the notice generated by a computer device, showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the Administrator. A violation notice issued, signed and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer generated record, shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceeding without the need to provide foundation. The person issuing or certifying the violation notice is not required to appear at an administrative or legal proceeding in order to have the violation notice admitted.

The person issuing and serving the violation notice is not required to appear at the administrative hearing due to the properly prepared violation notice being deemed to be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The Hearing Officer shall make a determination of violation liability or no liability and enter the appropriate findings or orders. 
In the event the Hearing Officer makes a determination of violation liability, the appropriate order shall be mailed by the Village via first class mail to Respondent, and to other owners if the other owners were given notice of the pending violation. The order shall bear the date of mailing on its face and specify the amount owed for a fine and penalty for late payment incurred, if any. In the event the Hearing Officer determines that a Respondent is not liable for the violation, then the appropriate order shall be entered and made a part of the file. If the finding of no liability was the result of a contest by mail, then a copy of the order shall be mailed via first class mail to the Respondent. 
(Ord. No. 08-3-C-3605, § 3, 3-17-2008; Ord. No. 09-5-C-3677, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-1099. - Petition to set aside a determination. 
Whenever an administrative hearing is held for the purpose of determining the question of violation liability, and the Respondent does not appear, the Respondent may file a written petition with the Administrator to set aside a Hearing Officer's Determination of violation liability.

(c)  Upon the Administrator's denial of a petition to set aside the Hearing Officer's Determination of liability, or upon the expiration of the 14 day period for filing such petition without a filing being made, the Hearing Officer's determination is a "final decision" for purposes of judicial review. The Administrator shall notify the Respondent of the decision on the petition via first class mail. Should the Administrator assign a new hearing date pursuant to paragraph (b)(iii), above, then the determination is not considered a final decision. Should the Respondent fail to appear at the newly assigned hearing date, then the Respondent shall not have the right to petition the Administrator to set aside a subsequent determination of violation liability and the Hearing Officer's Determination of violation liability shall be a "final decision" for purposes of judicial review. 
(d)  A Respondent that appears at the administrative hearing does not have the right to petition the Administrator to set aside the Hearing Officer's Determination. In such case, the Hearing Officer's Determination is a "final decision" for purposes of judicial review. 
(e)  A Respondent does not have the right to file a petition to set aside a Hearing Officer's Determination which is based upon the Respondent's failure to request a hearing, or pay the fine and late penalty, within 14 days of the Late Notice.

The issuance of a Class E license to a specific address is subject to the zoning classification and requirements within the various districts as outlined in Chapter 118 of the Skokie Village Code. 
(1)  Each Class E license shall only be valid at the address where the licensee's business is located. 
(2)  The existence of the five Commercial Liquor Districts, and the corresponding Class E license, does not preclude the use of any other license or the operation of any other business by a liquor licensee holding a license of another class in such districts. 
(3)  The Liquor Control Commissioner shall promulgate a set of rules detailing the timetable and procedures for initial issuance of the Class E licenses. Should the number of qualified applicants exceed the number of available licenses, the Liquor Control Commissioner shall conduct a lottery to determine the recipients. 
(f)  Class F license which shall authorize the sale or service of alcoholic liquor for consumption off the premises as part of a catering service, and limited to invited guests at private catered functions. Caterers holding class F licenses must be primarily in the business of the preparation and service of food, and must have food service available when alcoholic liquor is being served. 
(g)  Class G license which shall authorize the sale of beer, manufactured on the premises, by a Brew Pub, subject to an Operation Plan approved by the Local Liquor Control Commissioner. 
(h)  Class I license which shall authorize the sale of alcoholic liquor as part of an inclusive package for on-premises consumption. This license is not available to bars or restaurants. 
(i)  Class M license which shall authorize the retail sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption off-premises in establishments in which the sale of alcoholic liquor is a secondary function of the establishments and that encompass more than 10,000 square feet but less than 40,000 square feet of total retail space in the following areas of the Village: (i) the North Commercial Liquor District,(ii) the Central Commercial District, (iii) the South Commercial Liquor District, (iv) the East Midtown Commercial Liquor District, (v) the West Midtown Commercial District, and (vi) the Southeast Commercial Liquor District. A maximum of 300 linear feet of shelf space, including viewing coolers and all displays, may be designated for the retail sale of alcoholic liquor; notwithstanding the area restrictions stated in this paragraph. For purposes of this section, linear shelf space shall mean any single shelf, which may or may not be included in a shelving unit that is utilized for the promotion, display or retail sale of alcoholic liquor. An existing Class A license may be converted to a Class M license as provided in subparagraph 10-64(a)(5). 
(j)  Class O license which shall authorize the retail sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption off of the premises of the licensee. No alcoholic liquor shall be consumed on the premises of a Class O licensee unless such alcoholic liquor is being offered as a promotional event or taste testing without the payment of anything of value by the consuming patron. 
There will be two subclasses of Class O licenses as follows: 
(1)  A Subclass O1 shall be effective anywhere in the Village except those properties contained in the zoning district "Office Research district". A category of O1 shall be designated O1L, and will be limited to retail establishments that encompass more than 40,000 square feet of total retail space. There is no minimum percentage of floor space which is to be designated for the retail sale of alcoholic liquor. Upon adoption of Ordinance 11-1-C-3814, any licensee with over 40,000 square feet of total retail space shall be automatically converted to an O1L; and 
(2)  A Subclass O2 shall be effective solely in the zoning district "Office Research zoning district." 
(k)  Class P license which authorizes the retail sale of alcoholic liquor at a limited service or full service restaurant at a specific location. Any person or entity holding a Class A license and owning the real property on which a limited or full service restaurant, serving alcoholic liquor, is or will be operated, may convert the Class A license to a P-Right, having such rights as defined in subparagraph (2) below. 
(1)  Any Class A licensee, owning the real property (the "property owner") on which a tenant, or management entity, does or will operate a limited service or full service restaurant must obtain a P-Right from the Liquor Control Commissioner. The acquisition of a P-Right will render the Class A license null and void as if it were automatically repealed. The Liquor Control Commissioner shall not have the authority to reissue the Class A license. 
(2)  A P-Right entitles the property owner to designate to the Liquor Control Commissioner the identity of a tenant, or a successor tenant, to which a Class P license shall be issued. The tenant must submit an application, qualify for the license and comply with all sections of this Chapter. In the event the tenant's lease terminates, then the Class P license will be surrendered to the Village. The surrender, revocation or non-renewal of the Class P license will not affect the P-Right held by the property owner. 
(3)  The Liquor Control Commissioner may adopt rules and regulations regarding the exercise of P-Rights and issuance of Class P licenses. A P-Right shall continue in existence, and will not be subject to automatic termination or loss for non-use or inactivity, as long as the property owner does not violate this Chapter or the rules and regulations governing P-Rights or Class P licenses. The P-Right is transferable if the real property for which it applies, is transferred to a new property owner. A Class P license must be renewed annually. In the event no Class P license is in effect at the renewal time, the property owner must renew the P-Right, and the failure to so renew will cause the P-Right to become null and void. 
(4)  A P-Right shall only be in effect at the real property for which it was initially issued, however, it may be in effect for any location within the real property, or any adjacent real property, owned by the property owner. A Class P license shall only be in effect at the location for which it is issued. 
(5)  A property owner has the right to designate itself for the issuance of a Class P license. 
(l)  Class T license which shall authorize the retail sale of alcoholic liquor as part of the operation of live theaters and movie theaters, subject to an Operation Plan approved by the Local Liquor Control Commissioner. 
(m)  Class W license which shall authorize the retail sale of wine for consumption off of the premises. No wine shall be consumed on the premises of a Class W licensee unless it is being offered as part of a sampling or taste testing without the payment of anything of value by the consuming patron.

The determination of whether the Village has responded to an unreasonably high number of calls, or initiated an unreasonably high number of contacts, will be made by the Village's Nuisance Intervention and Prevention ("NIP") Committee, as provided in subsection (e). The NIP Committee will compare the number and character of calls or initiated contacts at a property to other properties of a similar type, that reasonably indicate that the activity at this property is out of character for that type of property and is impacting the quality of life in the area or Village. 
For the purposes of clauses (20), (21) and (22), the term property shall mean any parcel of real property, or part thereof, and may include any building and structure which is situated on the property. In the event a property includes more than one dwelling or residential unit, or one or more spaces available for occupation by a nonresidential use, then for the purposes of a determination as provided for in clause (22), above, all calls or initiated contacts, collectively made to the property, may be considered. Any activity or conduct occurring on a public way that abuts a property may be considered in the determination of whether a public nuisance is occurring, or has occurred, on the property. 
(e)  Property owner or occupant responsibility for certain nuisances. It is a violation of the Code for any person that owns, manages, occupies, or controls property (hereinafter the "Responsible Party") to create, encourage, permit or allow a public nuisance to occur on the property owned, managed, controlled or occupied by them. For purposes of the section, a person shall have the same meaning as Section 1-2 of the Code. A Responsible Party may be subject to the following procedures: 
(1)  The Village Manager shall appoint a five-person committee, comprised of one appointee from each of the following: Community Development Department, Police Department, Health Department, Human Services Division and the Manager's Office. The committee shall be known as the Nuisance Intervention and Prevention ("NIP") Committee. The NIP Committee may consult with other Village personnel as needed. 
(2)  Whenever any information is made available to a Village employee indicating that a property may constitute a public nuisance based upon activities or omissions described in clauses (20), (21) and (22) of subsection (d), above, then that employee shall refer the matter to the NIP Committee. The NIP Committee shall convene and review all facts and information in relation to the referral. If the NIP Committee reasonably believes that the activity constitutes a public nuisance, it may authorize and initiate any actions permitted by the Code or State law. 
(3)  In addition to taking any other action, the NIP Committee may initiate a "nuisance avoidance" meeting with the responsible party. The NIP Committee shall establish a nuisance avoidance meeting with the Responsible Party by giving them any type of notice that is reasonable based upon the circumstances, including, but not limited to, written notice via first class mail or telephonic or personal notice if the circumstances require expedient action. 
(4)  The purpose of the nuisance avoidance meeting between the NIP Committee and the responsible party is to discuss the facts and information and allow the responsible party to provide additional information. It is a violation of the Code for a responsible party to fail to appear at a nuisance avoidance meeting. The NIP Committee may decide to require the responsible party to take reasonable and warranted actions to correct or prevent the activity or omission that is a violation of the Code. Such decision shall be provided in writing. It is a violation of the Code for a responsible party not to implement the corrective or preventative actions. 
(5)  The corrective or preventative actions may require the responsible party to take such actions reasonably calculated to correct, or prevent the occurrence of, a public nuisance. In ordering such actions, the NIP Committee shall consider the magnitude of the harm caused by the activities or omissions, the value of the property, the impact on residents, property owners and businesses in the area or Village and other relevant circumstances. Such actions may include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Making improvements to the premises requested by the Village. 
b.  Installing alarms, lighting or other measures to enhance security. 
c.  Hiring of licensed and insured security personnel. 
d.  Hiring a third-party to take the corrective or preventative actions. 
e.  The initiation and execution of eviction proceedings against certain tenants. 
f.  Correction of a Code violation. 
(6)  The NIP Committee may recommend that the Village initiate the filing of a cause of action in the Circuit Court or a violation citation for administrative adjudication. Nothing in this Section will preclude the Village from initiating a cause of action in Circuit Court or issuing a violation notice for administrative adjudication without action or recommendation by the NIP Committee. 
(7)  Each day that a violation of this Section continues shall be a separate and distinct violation. The Village may enforce this Section through its administrative adjudication program, to the extent permitted by law, or through an action initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Village Manager is authorized to conduct hearings to determine whether any license, permit or certificate of occupancy held by the Responsible Party, or issued in connection within any property, should be revoked or suspended. 
(8)  No person evicted in relation to nuisance preventative or corrective actions shall receive relocation assistance from the Village.

Such notice shall direct the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining such nuisance to abate or remove such nuisance within 24 hours and shall state that, unless such nuisance is so abated, the Village will cause the nuisance to be abated and will charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be. 
(2)  Abatement by Village. If the nuisance is not abated within the time provided, or if the owner, occupant or person causing the nuisance cannot be found, Village Manager or designee shall cause the abatement or removal of such public nuisance. 
(c)  Abatement by court action. If the inspecting officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists on private premises but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the inspecting officer shall file a written report of the officer's findings with the Village Manager, who shall cause an action to abate such nuisance to be commenced in the name of the Village. 
(Code 1979, § 12.03)  
Sec. 42-37. - Collection of costs of abatement by Village.

(b)  Any Owner that leases property to another Person shall utilize a "Crime Free" Lease Addendum. The addendum is to make the occupancy of a leased premises by an individual engaged in violent or drug-related crimes or the use of a leased premises in the commission of a crime, or in furtherance of the commission of certain criminal activity, by a Tenant, a Tenant's invitee or other Person authorized or allowed by the Tenant or the Tenant's family to be on the leased premises, a lease violation. The language for a Crime Free Lease Addendum is in subsection (h), below. 
(c)  In the event that criminal activity occurs in a leased premises that constitutes (i) any class of felony, or (ii) a Class A misdemeanor at least twice in one year, then an Owner, or authorized agent, shall initiate eviction proceedings against the Tenant participating in the criminal activity as specified in the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 ILCS 5/9-101 et seq. For the purposes of this Section, a Tenant that was a non-culpable victim or was not participating in criminal activity shall not be evicted for the reason of the criminal activity. This Section shall also not apply to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking for any violation of the Crime Free Lease Addendum. In the event the Owner, authorized agent, or Tenant believes that the circumstances are such that eviction should not be undertaken, then they shall file a written request detailing the circumstances with the Nuisance Intervention and Prevention Committee, (hereinafter "NIP Committee") and request a determination of whether eviction is inappropriate. The NIP Committee may, at its discretion, meet with the Owner, authorized agent, and any other Person, including the Tenant, that may have relevant information regarding the circumstances. The NIP Committee shall render a written determination on the question of whether eviction is inappropriate and may deliver it via first class mail. The NIP Committee may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
1.  The activity itself, 
2.  The age of the participants involved in the activity, 
3.  Whether the Tenant was a non-culpable victim of the activity, or 
4.  Any other factors the NIP Committee deems relevant.

An Owner may include language in the lease that authorizes eviction for more minor offenses than indicated in paragraph (h). In the event criminal activity occurs that is not a felony, or a Class A misdemeanor twice within twelve months, then the decision to initiate eviction proceedings is discretionary for the Owner. 
(e)  Whenever an Owner is proceeding with an eviction pursuant to paragraph (h), the Owner may request that the Village of Skokie Corporation Counsel or designee appear before the court or prepare a written submission when there is a hearing on the eviction, not to represent the Owner, but to support the eviction proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Code. The decision to appear is at the discretion of the Corporation Counsel. 
(f)  It is a violation of the Code for an Owner to not include a Crime Free Lease Addendum in a written lease affecting property in the Village. If the leasing of a property is an oral arrangement, then the Owner must notify the Tenant in writing that the Crime Free Lease Addendum is a condition of the lease and the Tenant is obligated to adhere to its language. The Owner, or authorized agent, must keep sufficient records to demonstrate that such notice is provided. It is a violation of the Code for an Owner to not enforce the Crime Free Lease Addendum. 
(g)  The Village may conduct "Crime Free Property" seminars from time to time. Any Owner, agent of an owner, or Tenant may be required to attend the Village's Crime Free Property seminars at the request of the Village Manager based on the following considerations: 
(1)  If the property rented or leased by the Owner is a nuisance property as defined in this Section 42-35; 
(2)  Criminal activity occurred on the property; or 
(3)  Upon the recommendation of the NIP Committee.

Proper disposal of underground tanks. If a tank is to be disposed of as junk, it shall be retested for flammable vapors, and, if necessary, rendered gas-free (so that vapors from the combustible or flammable liquid from the tank are not present in a concentration sufficient to support combustion). After junking and before releasing to a junk dealer, a sufficient number of holes or openings (at least 2 percent of the total surface area of the tank) should be made in it to render it unfit for further use. NFPA 327, Standard Procedures for Cleaning or Safeguarding Small Tanks and Containers, provides information on safe procedures for such operation.

(6)  Adherence to the regulations of the Office of the State Fire Marshal, Title 41, Chapter 430, Act 15/2, Regulation of Tanks, as well as any other applicable State and federal regulations, is required. 
Properly safeguarding an underground tank means that:

b.  The court may, without entering a judgment of guilty, place such person under court supervision for any period not exceeding 1 year. Such supervision may include any of the conditions provided for in subsection (a)(2) of this section as the court determines appropriate. If the person completes the period of supervision without violating the conditions imposed by the court, the court shall discharge the defendant from supervision and dismiss the charge against the defendant. If the person, while under court supervision, is convicted of any criminal offense in any jurisdiction and the State's Attorney or municipal prosecutor, as the case may be, moves for termination of supervision, the court shall terminate the supervision and enter a judgment of guilty on the plea or finding. 
(2)  The conditions of court supervision may, in addition, require that the defendant:

When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period of court supervision, may impose an additional period of not more than 2 years. Only the conditions of payment shall continue to apply during such additional period. The court shall retain all of the incidents of the original sentence, including the authority to modify or enlarge the original conditions and to revoke the penalty of court supervision if the conditions of payment are violated during such additional period. 
(4)  When the petition is filed charging a violation of a condition imposed for court supervision, the court: 
a.  May order a summons to the offender to appear, or order a warrant for the offender's arrest where there is danger of the offender fleeing the jurisdiction or causing serious harm to others or when the offender fails to answer a summons. The issuance of such warrant or summons shall stay the sentence of court supervision until the final determination of the charge, and the term of court supervision shall not run so long as the offender has not answered the summons or warrant. 
b.  Shall conduct a hearing of the alleged violation. The court may admit the offender to bail pending the hearing. 
c.  Shall receive evidence in open court with the right of confrontation, cross examination and representation by counsel. The Village has the burden of going forward within the evidence and proving the violation by the preponderance of the evidence. 
d.  Shall not revoke court supervision for failure to comply with conditions of a sentence which imposes financial obligations upon the offender unless such failure is due to the offender's willful refusal to pay. 
e.  May modify the conditions of court supervision on motion of the Village or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice to all parties and a hearing. 
(5)  If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue the offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time of the initial penalty. 
(6)  A judgment revoking a sentence of court supervision is a final appealable order.

Sec. 70-306. - Truancy.

Truancy has an effect on society as a whole, which may be realized through parents missed work time, truant kids engaging in more severe or criminal activity or the downgraded education of our population. 
The intent of this section is to address the issue of chronic truancy regarding those students enrolled in schools located within the corporate limits of the Village of Skokie and, if appropriate, mandate through the Circuit Court of Cook County available services as may be necessary to resolve the underlying issues of chronic truancy.

It shall be a violation of this section for a minor who is 16 years of age or younger enrolled in any school located within the corporate limits of the Village of Skokie and subject to the compulsory attendance requirements of the Illinois School Code, to engage in a pattern of continuing or chronic absenteeism from a school accredited or certified by the Illinois Department of Education, without cause or an acceptable excuse. 
b.  A Chronic Truant Minor shall be identified to the Skokie Police Department by the minor's school, along with any and all information detailing his or her absences from school. 
c.  Prior to a minor being cited under this section for chronic truancy, his or her school must have provided supportive services, including prevention, diagnostic, intervention and remedial services, alternative programs and other school and community resources that have failed to result in the cessation of habitual or ongoing truant behavior, or has been offered to the student and refused.

It shall be a violation of this section for any parent, guardian, or person having custody or control of a child, who is enrolled in any school accredited or certified by the Illinois Department of Education located in the Village of Skokie, to cause, permit or encourage a child he or she is responsible for, to violate this section of the Village Code. 
(e)  Excused Absences. If a parent, guardian or person having legal custody and control over a student presents in writing to school officials, any of the following reasons for a student's absence, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is a legitimate and acceptable excuse:

(g)  Penalty. A violation of this section shall be punishable by the penalties set forth in Section 1-6, including but not limited to a fine of $750.00.

If this option is offered to and accepted by the individual, and he or she completes the ordered course of action, the Corporation Counsel's Office will dismiss the violation.

The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article, including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village Manager or designee in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village Manager or designee or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village Manager or designee. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and

(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Manager or designee, and may also include reasonable directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in 1 location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Manager or designee may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) of this section for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee under this article; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for such withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of fund.

Within 90 days following written notice from the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(2)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(3)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or 
(4)  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise. 
(c)  Emergency removal or relocation. The Village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way located within the Village, as the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the Village shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility, and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(d)  Abandoned facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way located within the Village, the utility shall notify the Village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the Village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Village Manager or designee determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. If the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.

(1)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way, including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Village Manager or designee or the Manager's duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing the Manager or designee or agent as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs.

Sec. 94-4. - Interpretation and severability. 
(a)  Interpretation. The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, general welfare, and the purposes provided above. Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this chapter upon the subdivision of land are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of these regulations or of any other applicable law, ordinance, rule, or regulation of any kind, the regulations that are more restrictive and impose higher standards or regulations shall govern. 
(b)  Severability. The provisions of this chapter shall be severable in accordance with the following:

Each separate common area and outlot shall be counted as an additional lot. All petitioners filing for subdivisions shall also pay an additional fee to cover the cost of recording the plat with Cook County.

Chapter 95 - RIGHT OF WAY VACATIONS 
 
Sec. 95-1. - Vacation initiated by Village. 
(a)  The vacation of unopened or unimproved public rights of way may be made, as determined by the Village. In the event the Village initiates the process for vacating an unopened or unimproved public right of way as part of the Village's Program to Vacate Unopened and Unimproved Streets or Alleys, the Village shall perform all required steps of the vacation process and pay all costs associated with the vacation case. In such case: (i) the Village will remove any driveway aprons and restore any affected parkway, and (ii) if the vacated land is divided equally amongst all abutting property owners, no compensation will be due to the Village. 
(b)  Compensation shall be paid to the Village for vacated public rights of way if any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The entire area is directed to one property owner, then nominal compensation in the amount of $1,000 shall be paid to the Village. 
(2)  Property owners who receive front footage that creates sufficient lot area to subdivide into two buildable lots, shall compensate the Village for the fair market value of the rights of way vacated. Payment shall be due at the time of the subdivision or transfer of title of a buildable portion of the lot, whichever occurs first. 
(c)  The Village Manager or designee shall promulgate rules and procedures for the Village's Program to Vacate Unopened and Unimproved Streets or Alleys, which may be amended from time to time.

Sec. 95-2. - Vacation initiated by abutting property owners. 
(a)  Property owners that petition the Village for the vacation of public rights of way that is not part of the Village's Program to Vacate Unopened and Unimproved Streets or Alleys, shall pay all costs involved in the vacation process and compensate the Village for the fair market value for the rights of way vacated. 
(b)  Any exception to the requirement to compensate the Village for the fair market value of vacated rights of way must meet one of the following conditions and be approved by the Mayor and Board of Trustees: 
(1)  When the property adjacent to the public right of way to be vacated was sold within the previous two years and the square foot purchase price for the property is less than the Village's appraised value for the right of way, then the square foot purchase price sale shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the rights of way. 
(2)  When the Village retains an easement for existing Village utilities (not electric or gas) or for the installation of future Village utilities, the fair market value of the rights of way shall be discounted by 60 percent to reflect that a structure cannot be built on the vacated rights of way or there may be other restrictions on the use of the vacated right of way related to the maintenance or installation of Village utilities. 
(3)  When the abutting property owner dedicates new public rights of way equal or greater area than the rights of way being vacated, then the property owner shall not pay compensation for the rights of way vacated. Dedications of portions of streets for widening purposes, radii improvements or other improvements to the public rights of way shall not be considered as a fair market value offset for any rights of way vacated. 
(4)  When the rights of way to be vacated are located in an established redevelopment district, tax increment finance district, or special service area, the compensation due the Village may be reduced if the fair market value of the rights of way is more than 5 percent of the value of the property into which the vacated rights of way will merge. If the fair market value of the rights of way is: 
i.  5 to 10 percent of the value of the property into which the vacated rights of way will merge, then the abutting property owner must pay 75 percent of the appraised value; or if 
ii.  Over 10 percent, then the abutting property must pay 50 percent of the appraised value. 
(5)  Residential property owners receiving front or rear footage that does not create sufficient lot area to subdivide into two buildable lots shall not be required to pay compensation for the property acquired. However, nominal compensation in the amount of $1,000 shall be paid to the Village. This amount shall be used to recover the costs incurred by the Village related to the vacation. 
(6)  The Village Manager or designee shall promulgate rules and procedures, which may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 10-2-C-3738, § 1, 2-16-2010; Ord. No. 19-7-C-4474, § 1, 7-15-2019)  
Sec. 95-3. - Appraisal for Fair Market Value. 
Whenever compensation for the fair market value of vacated rights of way would be due to the Village, the Village shall retain an appraiser to determine the fair market value of the rights of way.

(e)  Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the Village. 
(f)  It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available its books and records for inspection by the Village.

(g)  If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within 45 days of the Village's determination of the amount of overpayment.

If a tax return is not filed within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing penalty of 5 percent of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of 5 percent of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the Village issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be assessed equal to 18 percent of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 01-1-F-2964, § 1(3.28.9), 1-2-2001)

Sec. 98-43. - Installment contracts. 
The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency.

(Ord. No. 01-1-F-2964, § 1(3.28.12), 1-2-2001)  
Sec. 98-45. - Voluntary disclosure. 
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1 percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than 4 years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this article must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

Sec. 98-47. - Review of liens. 
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall: 
(1)  Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense; 
(2)  Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and 
(3)  Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

Deed means any deed, any assignment of beneficial interest in an Illinois land trust, any assignment of partnership or limited liability company membership interest, assignment of stock, or articles of merger, or any other assignment, instrument or document of transfer or conveyance reflecting the transfer of or otherwise transferring legal title, equitable title, or both legal and equitable title to any real property or interest therein, the beneficial interest in an Illinois land trust owning any real property or interest therein, or the controlling interest in a real estate entity. 
Grantee means any grantee, transferee, purchaser, assignee or the person accepting or named in a deed as the person to which or to whom any real property or interest therein, any beneficial interest in real property or interest therein or the controlling interest in a real estate entity is transferred by such deed.

Sec. 98-75. - Imposition of tax. 
(a)  A tax is imposed on the transfer of real property located in the Village as evidenced by the recordation or delivery of a deed by any person made after September 1, 1987, whether investing the owner with the beneficial interest in or legal title to the real property or merely the possession or use thereof for any purpose or to secure future payment of money or the future transfer of any such real property. 
(b)  The tax imposed in this article shall also be imposed on the transfer of a controlling interest in a real estate entity for all such transfers made after January 17, 1997. The tax imposed by this article shall be due whether the transfer of a controlling interest in a real estate entity is effected by 1 transaction or by a series of related transactions. For purposes of this subsection, it shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, that transactions are related if they occur within the same 24-month period. 
(c)  The tax imposed shall be $3.00 for every $1,000.00 of the transfer price or fraction thereof as stated in the declaration. 
(d)  Delivery of any deed shall be deemed to have occurred when the grantee, or the grantee's representative or agent, receives possession of the deed or, in the case of an Illinois land trust, when the trustee receives possession of a valid assignment of a beneficial interest. In the case of other transfers, delivery shall be deemed to occur when the grantee, or the grantee's representative or agent, receives or becomes entitled to receive possession of the deed.

Sec. 98-76. - Liability for payment. 
The primary liability for payment of the tax imposed by this article shall be borne by the grantor involved in any such transaction unless otherwise negotiated by contract; provided, however, it shall be unlawful for the grantee to accept a deed if the transfer tax has not been paid. If the tax has not been paid, then the real property that is the subject of the transfer shall be subject to the lien provided in Section 98-84 and the grantee or purchaser shall be liable for payment of the tax. The tax levied in this article shall be in addition to any and all other taxes. 
(Code 1979, § 10.03)

Where the declaration is signed by an attorney, agent, licensed real estate salesperson or broker, on behalf of the person or persons who have the power of direction to direct the trustee under a land trust agreement to act, the trustee being the mere repository of record legal title with a duty of conveying the real estate subject to the trust agreement only when and if directed in writing by the person or persons having the power of direction, the attorney, agent, licensed real estate salesperson, or broker need only identify the land trust which is the repository of record legal title and not the person or persons having the power of direction under the land trust agreement. 
(Code 1979, § 10.04)  
Sec. 98-78. - Deeds. 
Every deed shall show the date of the transaction which it evidences, the names of the grantor and grantee, and the common address, permanent real estate tax identification number and legal description of the real property to which it relates.

(6)  Transactions in which the deed is a tax deed; 
(7)  Transactions in which the deed releases real property which is security for a debt or other obligation, unless the grantee of the deed intends to own the property which is the subject of the transaction and: (i) lease it or part of it to a third party; (ii) operate a business on it; (iii) construct or rehabilitate any building; or (iv) reside in a building on the property. If the grantee is an agency of the United States of America or the State of Illinois, or a bank, savings and loan or other financial institution that is chartered by a U.S. agency or regulated by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, the transaction remains exempt; 
(8)  Transactions in which the deed is from a bank, trust company, financial institution, insurance company or other similar entity, or nominee, custodian, or trustee therefor, to a public officer or commission, or person designated by such officer or commission or by a court, in the taking over of its assets, in whole or in part, under State or federal law regulating or supervising such institutions, or upon redelivery or retransfer by any such transferee or successor thereto;

(10)  Transactions from a bankrupt or person in receivership due to insolvency to the trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, from such receiver to such trustee or from such trustee to such receiver, or upon redelivery or retransfer by any such transferee, trustee or successor thereto; 
(11)  Transactions between subsidiary corporations and their parents for no consideration other than the cancellation or surrender of the subsidiary corporation's stock; 
(12)  Transactions wherein there is a contemporaneous exchange of real property involving the same parties, except that the money difference or money's worth paid from 1 or the other shall not be exempt from the tax; 
(13)  Transactions representing transfers subject to the imposition of a documentary stamp tax imposed by the government of the United States; 
(14)  A transfer by lease (other than by means of a ground lease which constitutes a transfer of the beneficial interest in real property); and

Sec. 98-80. - Construction of exemptions. 
All exemptions from the taxes imposed by this article shall be strictly and narrowly construed, and all other provisions of this article shall be broadly construed in order to give effect to the intent of this article, which is to tax all transfers of real property within the Village, unless specifically exempt. 
(Code 1979, § 10.07)  
Sec. 98-81. - Method of collection; revenue stamps required; exempt transaction fee. 
(a)  The tax levied and imposed by this article shall be collected by the Village Manager or designee for the Village through the sale of revenue stamps, which shall be caused to be prepared by the Village Manager or designee in such quantities and denominations as the Village Manager or designee may from time to time prescribe. Such revenue stamps shall be available for sale at and during the regular business hours of the Village offices or at other locations designated by the Village Manager or designee. Upon payment of the tax levied and imposed by this article, the revenue stamps so purchased shall be affixed to the deed or other instrument of conveyance. Any person so using and affixing a revenue stamp or stamps shall cancel it and so deface it as to render it unfit for use by marking it with the person's initials and the day, month and year when the affixing occurs. Such markings shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or by perforating with a machine or punch. However, the revenue stamp(s) shall not be so defaced as to prevent ready determination of its denomination and genuineness. 
(b)  An exempt stamp and compliance with Section 98-88 and all other provisions of this article shall be required for all real estate transfers which are exempt pursuant to Section 98-79. There shall be a fee as provided in Section 46-34 for any exempt transaction. The property owner shall be responsible for payment of the fee provided for in this section. 
(Code 1979, § 10.08)

(Code 1979, § 10.09)  
Sec. 98-83. - Acceptance of assignment of interest by trustee of land trust. 
No trustee of an Illinois land trust shall accept or acknowledge an assignment of beneficial interest in real estate located in the Village without first obtaining a real estate transfer declaration from the assignor and assignee and unless Village revenue stamps in the required amount or a Village exemption stamp, as set forth in this article, have been affixed to the assignment. 
(Code 1979, § 10.10)  
Sec. 98-84. - Lien for unpaid tax.

To prevent actual multi-state or multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this State on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this State which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this State.

Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Ordinance shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the manner provided by the Department.

(b)  Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

(4)  Driving a motor vehicle when the driver's license has been expired for more than one year, or the driver's permit, restricted driver's permit or other driving privilege has expired, regardless of whether such expired license, permit, restricted driver's permit or other driving privilege was previously issued by the State of Illinois or another state. 
(b)  No vehicle shall be seized and impounded pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3) and (4), above, if the driver was driving pursuant to certain exceptions to the licensing requirements, as allowed in Section 5/6-102 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(c)  In the event a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this Division, the owner of the motor vehicle shall be liable to the Village for an administrative and public safety fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00), in order to cover the costs incurred by the Village in ensuring that the motor vehicle is properly removed from the scene of the incident and the vehicle, and personal property enclosed therein, is secured and safeguarded.

(d)  Upon demonstration that it has the right to possession of a seized motor vehicle, a lessor, whether a rental agency or otherwise, or lien holder of a motor vehicle shall have the right to pay the administrative and public safety fee and be issued a release from the Skokie Police Department authorizing it to gain possession of the vehicle.

(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008)  
Sec. 106-143. - Seizure and impoundment procedures. 
(a)  Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to Section 106-142, above, the police officer shall order that the vehicle be seized and impounded. The Skokie Police Department shall utilize the services of a private towing company. If towed, the motor vehicle must be impounded and stored in a secure facility owned, leased, or operated by the private towing company. 
(b)  The police officer shall inform the person being arrested for the offenses identified in Section 106-142, or any owner of the vehicle at the scene of the arrest, of the circumstances, rights and obligations related to the: 
(1)  Seizure and impoundment of the vehicle; 
(2)  Owner's right to retrieve the vehicle by payment of the administrative and public safety fee to the Village and towing and storage fees and costs to the private towing company; and 
(3)  Availability of posting a bond in the full amount of the administrative and public safety fee and to request a hearing before an administrative hearing officer to determine whether or not the seizure and impoundment was proper. 
(c)  The police officer shall allow for another properly licensed and otherwise fit person to drive the vehicle, if insured, from the scene of the arrest if that person is the owner, or is authorized by the owner, and such person is present at the scene prior to the arrival of the tow truck. The police officer shall not be under any duty or requirement to: 
(1)  Inform the person being arrested that he or she may contact another person to remove the vehicle from the scene of the incident;

(d)  Upon the arrest of a driver for violations referenced in Section 106-142 above, the vehicle shall not be removed from the scene by any owner, or another person authorized by the owner, if the police officer determines that the vehicle should not be released due to the applicability of Section 106-149, below. 
(e)  The imposition of the administrative and public safety fee shall not apply if the vehicle driven by a person arrested in connection with the offenses identified in Section 106-142, was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within twenty-four (24) hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008)  
Sec. 106-144. - Release of motor vehicle. 
(a)  The owner of a motor vehicle that is seized and impounded pursuant to this Division may regain possession of the vehicle by first: (i) paying to the Village the $500 administrative and public safety fee; or (ii) posting a bond in the full amount of the fee, pursuant to Section 106-145. The fee or bond shall be paid at the Skokie Police Department. The fee or bond shall only be paid with cash, credit card, cashier's or certified check, or other type of payment acceptable to the Village that has the legal effect of being equivalent to the aforementioned methods of payment. 
(b)  Upon payment of the fee or bond, the Department shall provide the owner with a document authorizing the release of the vehicle from the private towing company. No release shall be granted unless proof of insurance is provided. The owner may present the Department-issued document authorizing release to the private towing company, and upon payment of any fees and costs to company for towing and storage of the vehicle, shall regain possession of the vehicle. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008)  
Sec. 106-145. - Right to a hearing; posting of bond. 
(a)  Any owner, or lien holder or lessor of record, shall have the right to a hearing before an administrative hearing officer to contest whether the seizure and impoundment was proper. All requests for a hearing shall be made in person at the Skokie Police Department. If a request for a hearing is made, a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) must be posted with the Skokie Police Department and it shall be held by the Village until the administrative hearing officer makes a final decision. 
(b)  Administrative hearings shall be held at the time and date as the Village may schedule for the conduct of business by the administrative hearing officer. If a request for a hearing is not made at the time the administrative and public safety fee is paid or the bond is posted, the owner shall be deemed to have waived the right to an administrative hearing. No party shall have a right to a hearing unless requested within 10 days of the date of the notice referenced in Section 106-146. 
(c)  Administrative hearing procedures shall be as follows: 
(1)  All parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present testimony and evidence at the administrative hearing. Continuances of the administrative hearing date must be made in person before the administrative hearing officer and may be granted upon a showing of good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible, subject to the discretion of the administrative hearing officer. 
(2)  The Village shall not be required to produce any police officer or other witness at the administrative hearing. The Village may file any and all documents, records or other tangible items prepared or maintained in the normal course of business that it desires the administrative hearing officer to consider at the hearing. The filing of the documents, records or items shall be accompanied by a certification from a Skokie police officer of a rank of Commander or higher, certifying that the records, documents or items were prepared or maintained in the normal course of business. Any records, documents or items filed and certified, shall be admitted as evidence at the hearing, and the facts and contents contained therein shall be presumed true and correct without the need for any additional foundation. 
(3)  If an owner appears at the administrative hearing and the administrative hearing officer determines that the seizure and impoundment was proper, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner does not appear at the hearing, then the administrative hearing officer, upon a review of the file, shall make a determination on the question of whether the seizure and impoundment was proper. 
(4)  If the administrative hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the seizure and impoundment was proper, the administrative hearing officer shall enter a final order finding the owner of the vehicle liable to the Village for the administrative and public safety fee in the amount of $500.00. In the event a bond was posted, it will be retained by the Village as final payment of the administrative and public safety fee. If the administrative hearing officer finds that the seizure and impoundment was not proper, the bond will be returned to the owner and the Department shall issue a release for the vehicle, if still impounded. A finding that the seizure and impoundment was not proper shall not have any bearing on whether the owner is obligated to pay the towing and storage fees and costs, and the owner must pay all fees and costs owed to the private towing company. 
(5)  The decision by the administrative hearing officer on the issue of whether the seizure and impoundment was proper, shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. (2006), as now or hereafter amended. A party must exhaust its administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008; Ord. No. 09-3-C-3667, § 1, 3-2-2009)  
Sec. 106-146. - Notice of seizure and impoundment. 
(a)  The Village shall, within five (5) business days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this Division, send a written notice by first class mail to all owners of the vehicle. Copies of the notice shall be sent to any lien holder or lessee or lessor, if determinable using reasonable efforts. 
(1)  The notice shall: (i) state that the motor vehicle was seized and impounded; (ii) contain all pertinent facts relating to the date, time and reason for the seizure and impoundment; (iii) specify the procedures by which possession of the vehicle may be regained; (iv) state that the failure to regain possession of the vehicle, pursuant to the provisions of this Division, shall result in the vehicle being disposed of pursuant to law; and (v) explain the right to request an administrative hearing. In the event an administrative hearing was requested, then the notice shall provide the date and time of the scheduled hearing and the identity of the person requesting the hearing. 
(2)  The notice shall not be mailed if: (i) the administrative and public safety fee has been paid, and possession of the vehicle has been regained by an owner, within five (5) business days after the vehicle is seized and impounded; or (ii) possession of the vehicle may not be regained due to the vehicle being retained by the Skokie Police Department pursuant to the provisions of Section 106-149, below. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008; Ord. No. 09-3-C-3667, § 1, 3-2-2009)  
Sec. 106-147. - Collection of unpaid administrative and public safety fee. 
If an administrative and public safety fee is imposed pursuant to this Division, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing the Village of Skokie. The Village may collect on the debt using all means permitted by law, including, without limitation, obtaining a judgment on the debt and enforcing such judgment against the owner, or disposing of the vehicle as unclaimed vehicle. 
The Village may commence legal proceedings to collect an unpaid administrative and public safety fee, or take actions to dispose of the impounded vehicle: (i) 35 days after a determination was made at the requested administrative hearing that the seizure and impoundment was proper, and no petition was filed in the Circuit Court seeking judicial review of the administrative hearing officer's determination; (ii) 30 days after a final order is rendered by a judge of the Circuit Court whenever a petition seeking judicial review was filed by a party; or (iii) 15 days after the notice referenced in Section 106-146, above, was mailed and no administrative hearing was requested. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008; Ord. No. 09-3-C-3667, § 1, 3-2-2009)  
Sec. 106-148. - Lien holders. 
Except as may otherwise be provided by law, no owner, lien holder, lessor, or other person, shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this Division, until the administrative and public safety fee has been paid or a bond is posted. However, whenever a lien holder against the impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, then possession of the vehicle shall be given to lien holder without the requirement that the administrative and public safety fee be paid or bond posted, conditioned upon the lien holder agreeing in writing to pay to the Village the fee from the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008)  
Sec. 106-149. - Release of motor vehicle not allowed. 
The provisions of this Division authorizing an owner, or other party, to regain possession of a motor vehicle are not applicable when vehicle or asset forfeiture proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws or Article 36 of the Illinois Criminal Code of 1961. In such case, the Village shall not release, or dispose of, the vehicle to any person, except as consistent with those proceedings. 
In the event the Skokie Police Department determines that the vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to this Division should not be released to its owner or other persons, or disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle, due to the need to retain the vehicle as part of a continuing criminal investigation, or as evidence in a crime, then the Village shall notify the owner that the vehicle will be retained and not released except as required by law. 
(Ord. No. 08-2-C-3593, § 1, 2-4-2008)  
Sec. 106-150. - Multiple owners. 
Whenever in this Division the word owner is used, it shall apply to all owners. This Division presumes that all owners have equal rights to a seized and impounded vehicle. In instances of multiple owners of a vehicle, the Village shall not have any duty or responsibility to inquire or determine whether all owners concur with, or object to, any action taken, or omissions, by any one owner in relation to the vehicle seized and impounded.

DIVISION 5. - VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION PURSUANT TO ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, adopted Apr. 7, 2008, supplied provisions to be added to the Code as §§ 106-151106-159. In order to maintain the existing numbering system and ease of use of the Code, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been redesignated as §§ 106-150.1106-150.9 to read as set out herein. 
 
Sec. 106-150.1. - Program of vehicle immobilization. 
Chapter 2, Article XII, establishes procedures and processes for the administrative adjudication for violations of vehicular parking, standing, compliance and Automated Traffic Law regulations (hereinafter referred to as "Administrative Adjudication System"). This Division 5 creates a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. This Division authorizes the immobilization of eligible vehicles for unpaid final determinations of violation liability. 
The Traffic Compliance Administrator, as defined by Section 2-1092, or designee, in conjunction with the Skokie Chief of Police, or designee, are hereby authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization as provided in this Division. This program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon a public way, public property, or private property with consent of the property owners, by placement of a wheel restraint device in such a manner as to prevent the vehicle's operation. 
In the event an eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of Chapter 106 concerning obstruction of traffic, access or egress from driveways, alleys, fire lanes, hydrants or station, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or a hazard, the Chief of Police or designee may cause the eligible vehicle to be towed, without the need to first immobilize the vehicle or provide notice to the owner prior to such towing, by the Village or an authorized contractor thereof, to a Village vehicle pound or an approved vehicle storage facility pursuant to Section 106-93 et seq., of the Village Code. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.2. - Definitions. 
Unless the context shall otherwise require, words, terms and phrases used in this Division shall have their meaning as defined or stated in Chapter 2, Article XII. The definitions of the words, and the descriptions of the procedures, contained in Chapter 2, Article XII, are hereby incorporated into this Division as if stated in full. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.3. - Eligibility for immobilization. 
(a)  All vehicles eligible for immobilization shall be included on the immobilization eligibility list prepared by the Administrator. In the event an owner or vehicle accumulates five or more unpaid final determinations of liability, then all vehicles which are registered to that owner, or to the owner or owners of that vehicle, shall be eligible for immobilization. Specifically, those vehicles eligible for immobilization shall include: 
(1)  Any vehicle or vehicles registered to an owner, subsequent to the owner accumulating five or more unpaid final determinations of violation liability for parking, standing, compliance or Automated Traffic Law violations rendered pursuant to the Administrative Adjudication System on any vehicle or vehicles currently or previously registered to that same owner shall be eligible for immobilization. 
(2)  The State registration number or vehicle identification number of any vehicle registered to an owner who accumulated five or more unpaid final determinations of violation liability for parking, standing, compliance or Automated Traffic Law violations pursuant to the Administrative Adjudication System shall be eligible for immobilization. 
(3)  The name and address of any person that has accumulated five or more unpaid final determinations of violation liability for parking, standing, compliance or Automated Traffic Law violations pursuant to the Administrative Adjudication System shall be eligible for immobilization. 
(b)  In order to determine whether a subject vehicle is eligible for immobilization under this Division, the Administrator shall take into consideration and total all unpaid final determinations of violation liability: (i) in which the subject vehicle was the subject of the violation; (ii) whereby the owner of the subject vehicle has outstanding unpaid final determinations issued against the owner regardless of the identity or description of the vehicle for which the violation notice was issued against; and (iii) in relation to other vehicles which are, or were at the time of the violation notice, registered to the same owner of the subject vehicle. Each and every owner of a vehicle is deemed to be responsible for every violation notice issued in relation to that vehicle, regardless of whether a specific owner was named as a Respondent in the violation notice, the Late Notice, the Hearing Officer's Determination, or the Notice of Final Determination of Violation Liability. 
(c)  Notice of Impending Immobilization of an owner's vehicle or vehicles shall be sent by the Administrator or designee to the owner by first class mail to the address of the owner as recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State, or in the case of a vehicle bearing a registration of a state other than Illinois, the address of the owner recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles. The Notice shall be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to placing the vehicle, the owner, other vehicles registered to the owner, or the State registration number or vehicle identification number of the vehicle or vehicles on the immobilization eligibility list. Prior to sending Notice of Impending Immobilization, the Administrator or designee may verify with the Illinois Secretary of State, or a comparable keeper of records in another state, the address of record of the owner, however, the Administrator or designee has no duty to so verify such address due to the requirement placed on the owner in Chapter 2, Article XII, to keep the Administrator informed of the owner's current address. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.4. - Notice of impending immobilization, pre-immobilization hearings. 
(a)  The Notice required by 106-150.3(c) shall advise the owner that any vehicle registered to that owner is eligible for immobilization. The Notice shall also include the State registration numbers of the vehicle or vehicles to which the unpaid final determinations of violation liability were issued, the identification and nature of the regulations violated, and the issue dates of the violation notices. The Notice shall inform the owner that a challenge to the validity of the owner's inclusion on the immobilization list may be made to the Skokie Chief of Police or a designee by requesting, in writing, a pre-immobilization hearing. 
(b)  An owner of a vehicle who has received Notice of Impending Immobilization or whose vehicle has been placed on the immobilization list may be removed from the list by appearing at the Skokie Police Department and pay the amount owed in the Notice. The owner shall have the right to a pre-immobilization hearing to determine whether the owner or a vehicle was properly included on an immobilization list. The owner may file a written request for a hearing with the Chief of Police or designee and include a telephone number at which the person may be contacted. The Chief of Police or designee shall contact the person by telephone. A pre-immobilization hearing shall be conducted within seven business days of the receipt of the request for a pre-immobilization hearing, unless another date is mutually agreed upon by the owner and the Chief of Police or designee. The sole issue to be determined in a pre-immobilization hearing is whether the owner or a vehicle was properly included on the immobilization list. 
(c)  The owner may appear in person and may submit evidence at the pre-immobilization hearing, which would conclusively prove that the owner was not liable for the unpaid final determinations of violation liability for the parking, standing, compliance, or Automated Traffic Law violations listed in the Notice of Impending Immobilization. A person or a vehicle shall not be placed on the immobilization list if the Chief of Police or designee concludes that the number of unpaid final determinations that should not be considered would reduce the total below five unpaid final determinations, based upon the following: 
(1)  That the person was not the owner of the vehicle on the date or dates a violation notice was issued; or 
(2)  That the amount owed for a violation referenced in the Notice of Impending Immobilization was paid. 
(d)  Any vehicle eligible to be immobilized may be immobilized if payment of the amounts owed as stated in the Notice of Impending Immobilization is not made within 30 days of the date of said Notice. Subsequent to the mailing of a Notice of Impending Immobilization, no owner has the right to pay for any of the unpaid final determinations of violation liability without payment being made for all unpaid final determinations of violation liability listed in the Notice and any unpaid final determinations of violation liability that have arisen after the date of the Notice. The acceptance by a Village employee of payment for less than the full amount owed as stated in the Notice of Impending Immobilization plus amounts owed on unpaid final determinations arising subsequent to the Notice, does not impact the enforceability of the Village's right to immobilize eligible vehicles and the Village may proceed with the immobilization process. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008; Ord. No. 09-5-C-3677, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 106-150.5. - Post-immobilization. 
(a)  Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a Notice of Immobilization shall be affixed to the vehicle. The Notice shall state that the vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its damage or damage to the immobilizing restraint device. The Notice shall include the date and time that the immobilizing restraint device was affixed to the vehicle and provide information specifying the procedure: (i) to obtain the release of the vehicle from the immobilizing restraint device; and (ii) to pursue a post-immobilization hearing, should the owner desire such a hearing. 
(b)  The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall be permitted to secure release of the vehicle from the immobilizing restraint device by: 
(1)  Paying the immobilization fee, as specified in Section 46-230 of this Code, and any towing and storage fees, if applicable, and 
(2)  Taking one of the following actions: 
(A)  Paying the entire amount owed for the unpaid final determinations as specified in the Notice of Impending Immobilization plus an amount for any unpaid final determinations that arose subsequent to date of the Notice of Impending Immobilization to the Skokie Police Department; or 
(B)  Filing a written demand for a post-immobilization hearing and depositing a bond with the Skokie Police Department in the amount of 110% of the total amount owed in clauses (1) and (2)(A) above. 
All payments and bonds shall be in the form of U.S. currency, money order or certified check. No personal checks or credit cards shall be accepted. 
(c)  In the event the immobilizing restraint device has not been released pursuant to this Section within 72 hours of its placement, the restraint may be released and the vehicle towed and impounded pursuant to Section 106-93 et seq. In the event an owner has made a request for an post-immobilization hearing within 72 hours, then the vehicle shall not be towed and impounded until such time as the owner has had the opportunity to attend the post-immobilization hearing, but in no event shall this delay in towing and impounded exceed five days beyond the date that the request for a hearing is received by the Chief of Police or designee. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.6. - Post-immobilization hearing. 
(a)  The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a post-immobilization hearing. The owner may file a written request for hearing with the Skokie Chief of Police or designee within seven days of the immobilization. The person filing the request shall include a telephone number and the Chief of Police or designees shall contact that person by telephone to schedule the hearing. 
(b)  A post-immobilization hearing shall be conducted by the Chief of Police or designee within 48 hours of the receipt of a written request unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the owner and the Chief of Police or designee. Failure to request a hearing within seven days of the immobilization or attend a scheduled post-immobilization hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing. 
(c)  In the event an owner does not appear at a post-immobilization hearing, any bond posted pursuant to subsection 106-150.5(b)(2)(A) shall be forfeited to the Village. 
(d)  The sole issue to be determined in a post-immobilization hearing is whether the inclusion of the owner or vehicle onto the immobilization list was proper. If the Chief of Police or designee concludes that a sufficient number of unpaid final determinations referenced in the Notice of Impending Immobilization should not be considered, based upon the same reasons stated in Section 106-150.4(c)(1) and (2), and the resulting number of unpaid final determinations would be reduced below a total of five unpaid final determinations, then the person's vehicle shall be released without cost and the person or vehicle shall be removed from the immobilization list. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008; Ord. No. 09-5-C-3677, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 106-150.7. - Improper tampering with an immobilized vehicle. 
It is a violation of this Code to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilizing device. It is a violation of this Code to tamper with, remove, destroy or damage any immobilizing restraint device used in the immobilization of a vehicle. Any person that withholds an immobilizing restraint device from the Village or destroys or damages said device shall be liable for the cost to replace or repair the device. In addition to paying costs associated with the replacement or repair of the device, the person violating this Section shall be subject to a fine in the maximum amount allowed by this Code. Any person aiding or abetting in a violation of this Section shall be liable to the Village for damages and subject to the fine. Any citations, tickets or violation notices written for a violation of this Section shall be assigned to the administrative adjudication hearing process established pursuant to Chapter 2, Article X, of this Code. This Section shall not apply to a contractor performing its duties pursuant to an agreement with the Village. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.8. - Immobilization fee. 
The fee for immobilization shall be as set forth in Section 46-230. 
(Ord. No. 08-4-C-3608, § 4, 4-7-2008)  
Sec. 106-150.9. - Rules, regulations and agreements. 
(a)  The Chief of Police or designee, and the Administrator or designee, are authorized to establish rules, regulations, procedures and forms for the implementation of this Division. 
(b)  The Village Manager or designee is hereby authorized to enter into agreements, subject to the approval of the Corporation Counsel, with property owners in the Village of Skokie, to enable the Skokie Police Department to enter on to the property owner's private property for purpose of immobilizing eligible vehicles under this Division.

(d)  Foreclosure of lien. 
(1)  Property subject to a lien for unpaid water and sewer charges may be sold for nonpayment of the charges, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied towards payment of the charges, after deducting costs, as in the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. 
(2)  The Corporation Counsel shall institute such proceedings, in the name of the Village, in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which the bill for water and sewer service has remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered.

PREFACE 
    This Code volume contains the zoning chapter for this recodification of the general and permanent 
ordinances of the Village of Skokie, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the zoning chapter were the zoning ordinance, as 
supplemented through 1999 and subsequent ordinances. The source of each section is included in the 
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in 
the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the zoning ordinance Code, as 
supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have 
been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the zoning 
chapter is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 118 is numbered 118-2. Under this 
system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in 
their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting 
of one section that would logically come between sections 118-1 and 118-2 is desired to be added, such 
new section would be numbered 118-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same 
way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the 
case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive 
number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of 
the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is 
maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. The following are the parts of volume II, and their 
corresponding prefixes:

ZCD118:1 
ZONING COMPARATIVE TABLES 
ZCDCT:1 
ZONING STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 
ZCDSLT:1 
ZONING CODE INDEX 
ZCDi:1 
 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie 
Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Barbara Meyer, Corporation Counsel, Mark Vanderpool, Assistant 
Village Manager, and Keith Glatz, Purchasing Agent and Marlene Williams, Village Clerk, for their 
cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their 
efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of 
the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day 
administration of the village's affairs.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
ORDINANCE NO. 05-1-C-3333 
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 118 OF THE SKOKIE VILLAGE CODE PERTAINING TO THE 
INCLUSION OF EXISTING ZONING ORDINANCES INTO THE SKOKIE VILLAGE CODE 
    WHEREAS, on April 15, 2002, the Mayor and Board of Trustees of the Village of Skokie adopted the 
recodification of the Code of Ordinances for the Village of Skokie into the Skokie Village Code 
(hereinafter "SVC") that provided the additional benefit of making the SVC available to the public in an 
electronic format; and 
    WHEREAS, at the time the recodification was adopted, Chapter 118 was reserved for the Skokie 
zoning ordinances, however, they were not included in the recodification process because there were 
numerous amendments under consideration by the Skokie Plan Commission; and 
    WHEREAS, the Skokie Plan Commission and the Mayor and Board of Trustees have since 
completed their review of most major sections of the Village of Skokie zoning ordinances in 2004 and as 
a result, the Community Development Department and the Municipal Code Corporation (hereinafter 
"MCC") were able to complete the zoning ordinances recodification process; and 
    WHEREAS, Chapter 118 will contain the Skokie zoning ordinances and the content will be the same 
as the existing zoning ordinances, however, the numbering system will be consistent with the rest of the 
Village Code. In addition, the order of some sections have been changed to make them easier to find and 
use; and 
    WHEREAS, the Community Development Director recommended in his memorandum dated

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 1, adopted Oct. 7, 2013, deleted the former Art. I, §§ 118-1
118-30, and enacted a new Art. I as set out herein. The former Art. I pertained to in general. See the 
Code Comparative Table for a complete history of the former Art. I. 


Sec. 118-1. - General. 
(a) ?Title. This chapter may also be referred to as the "Zoning Ordinance." 
(b) ?Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard public health and welfare and to conserve the 
value of property by controlling the design, location, use, or occupancy of all buildings and structures 
through the regulated and orderly development of land and land uses within the Village. It is intended 
to benefit the public as a whole and not any specific person or class of persons. This chapter fulfills 
this intent by: 
(1) ?Determining the methods and procedures to implement and enforce this chapter, including, but 
not limited to, when site plan approval and planned developments are required and providing 
variations or relief from its requirements. 
(2) ?Considering the existing and future development or use of land in the Village under the 
guidance of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(3) ?Dividing the entire Village into districts, revising those districts as necessary, and defining and 
restricting uses allowed in those districts. 
(4) ?Restricting and regulating the location of buildings and structures on a lot or lots, including 
height and bulk, setbacks from property lines or other buildings or structures, the amount of 
open space, and the intensity of use. 
(5) ?Establishing standards for certain improvements such as building design and the amounts and 
locations of required landscaping and parking in a way that is compatible with the intended use 
of the zoning district. 
(c) ?Scope. The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, addition, alteration, moving, 
repair, and use of any building, structure, parcel of land, sign, or public rights-of-way within the 
Village. These provisions do not apply to towers, poles, and equipment of a public utility. 
    Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different requirements, the more 
restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific 
requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. Although not intended to abrogate any 
easement, covenant, or other private agreement, the requirements of this chapter shall govern whenever 
the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements. 
    Through the implementation, administration, and enforcement of this chapter, benefits and 
detriments may be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals, which is merely a byproduct of the overall 
benefit to the whole community. 
    If any portion of this code is held invalid for any reason, the remaining herein shall not be affected.

(b) ?Additions, alterations, or repairs. Additions, alterations, or repairs are permitted to be made to any 
building without requiring the existing building to comply with the requirements of this chapter, 
provided the addition, alteration, or repair conforms to the provisions of this chapter. 
(c) ?Maintenance. All buildings or parcels of land must be maintained by the owner. To determine 
compliance with this section, the Zoning Official is permitted to inspect any building or parcel of land. 
(d) ?Moved or temporary buildings, structures, and uses. Buildings, structures, or uses moved into or 
within the Village must comply with the provisions of this chapter.

Sec. 118-64. - Stormwater control. 
(a) ?Purpose . The purpose of this section is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, by 
controlling stormwater runoff resulting from the urbanization of the Village. Because the Village is 
located in a Combined Sewer Area, is committed to reduce combined sewer overflows occurrences, 
and is encouraging the use of Green Infrastructure on private development projects. 
(b) ?Applicability of the WMO. The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District's (MWRD) Watershed 
Management Ordinance (WMO) applies to all development within the Village boundaries. 
Components that are regulated under the WMO include qualified sewer construction, drainage and 
detention, volume control, floodplain management, isolated wetland protection, riparian environment 
protection, and soil erosion, and sediment control. As such: 
(1) ?The Village requires that all development obtain a permit letter of determination from MWRD's 
Engineering Department. 
(2) ?As developments within the Village may not be required to meet certain site stormwater 
management requirements under the WMO, the Village maintains its rights to enforce the 
Village's stormwater requirements as applicable under this section. 
(3) ?The Village requires that an Earthwork/Foundation permit consistent with WMO requirements 
be obtained from MWRD if site disturbance is to commence prior to the issuance of the MWRD 
permit. The purpose of this limited scope permit is to allow the issuance of an advanced 
'Foundation' permit from the Village. 
(4) ?Credit shall be given to Village required stormwater detention volumes for any volume control, 
as expressly required by WMO, or as installed by the developer. 
(c) ?Definitions . The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the 
meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different 
meaning: 
    Allowable release rate means the rate at which stormwater runoff is allowed to flow from the site 
into the Village sewer system. 
    Control structure means a structure having an outlet designed to control the stormwater runoff 
release rate. 
    Developed state means the condition of the site after development that is represented by a 
composite runoff coefficient based upon an imperious runoff coefficient of 0.95 and a pervious runoff 
coefficient of 0.25. 
    Excess stormwater runoff means the portion of the stormwater runoff that exceeds the allowable 
release rate. 
    100-year frequency rainfall shall be as defined by the Illinois State Water Survey. 
    On-site stormwater detention means the utilization of an on-site stormwater storage facility that 
is designed and maintained to temporarily contain stormwater only when excess stormwater runoff 
occurs. 
    On-site stormwater retention means the utilization of an on-site stormwater storage facility that 
is designed and maintained to temporarily contain stormwater when excess stormwater runoff occurs 
and to permanently hold an additional volume of water at a level which is at or below the level of the 
discharge point for such a storage facility. 
    Peak runoff rate means the rate of stormwater runoff that occurs when the duration of the 
rainfall is equal to or greater than the time of concentration. 
    Rainfall intensity means the amount of precipitation that occurs within a given period, expressed 
in inches of rainfall per hour. 
    Rational Method means the empirical method that relates stormwater runoff to rainfall intensity 
by the formula "Q = CiA" where "Q" is the peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second, "i" is the average 
rainfall intensity in inches per hour, and "A" is the area of the site in acres. 
    Runoff coefficient means the percentage of precipitation that appears as stormwater runoff. 
    Stormwater runoff means the portion of the precipitation from a rainfall event remaining after 
interception and evaporation losses which flows from the site into the Village sewer system. 
    Time of concentration means the time required for the stormwater runoff to become established 
and flow from the most remote part of the site to the point under consideration into the Village sewer 
system. 
    Two-year frequency rainfall shall be defined by the Illinois State Water Survey. 
    Undeveloped state means the natural condition of the site prior to development that is 
represented by a runoff coefficient of 0.15.

Sec. 118-175. - OR Office Research district. 
    The OR Office Research district is established to allow the development of business and 
professional offices, uses with "higher intensity" multifamily residences, and other compatible uses in a 
planned park-like setting. The district is intended to serve the Village and the surrounding urban region. 
Because of the unique character of properties located within this district and its proximity to the Edens 
Expressway, the Old Orchard Interchange, Cook County Forest Preserve and adjacent residential 
properties in other municipalities, all properties within this district require site plan approval in accordance 
with Article II of this chapter. Relief from any of the requirements of this district shall only be granted by 
the Mayor and Board of Trustees. The petitioner shall have the burden of providing evidence and 
persuasion that any such relief is necessary and desirable. Similarly granted relief to existing 
developments in the district shall not be sufficient to base justification for approval upon an already 
existing development. Each development shall be presented and judged on its own merits. The following 
requirements shall apply to the OR district: 
(1) ?Building height. The maximum building height shall be: 
a. ?North of Old Orchard Road: 105 feet. Buildings that exceed a height of 60 feet are required 
to have a yard to building height ratio of 2.5 to 1, from residentially zoned property. 
b. ?South of Old Orchard Road: 180 feet. Buildings that include residences shall have a 
minimum height of 80 feet. 
(2) ?Front yard. A front yard of 50 feet is required. 
(3) ?Side yards. Side yards of 50 feet are required. 
(4) ?Rear yard. A rear yard of 50 feet is required. 
(5) ?Yards abutting residential districts. 
a. ?All yards abutting residentially used property, whether or not such a residential district is 
located within the Village or is separated by a street or other public right-of-way, shall be 
not less than 150 feet in depth, from the nearest lot line of the residentially used property 
outside the OR district. 
b. ?Within the yards abutting residentially used property, no building or structure of any kind is 
permitted. 
c. ?On-grade off-street parking is permitted as close as 50 feet away from a lot line that abuts 
residentially used property, provided it is landscaped or screened as provided in this 
chapter. 
(6) ?Maximum land coverage by buildings. Land coverage of all buildings shall not exceed 30 
percent of the lot area. 
(7) ?Landscaping and site development. Berms, trees, walls and/or other forms of landscaping and 
site development are to be used to screen receiving and service areas as well as off-street 
parking which are visible from side and rear boundaries. This landscape screening may be 
located within the required yards. Earth berms banked on both sides, or with 1 side banked 
toward the yard boundary line and a retaining wall, shall have a side slope ratio of 3 to 1 for 
ease of maintenance. Planting used for screening shall be a mixture of low wide-spreading 
evergreens, with taller deciduous trees. 
(8) ?Landscaping and site development plan. A plan showing the proposed landscaping and site 
development must be prepared. It must be submitted as a part of or in addition to the site plan. 
Such items as embankment ratios, types of planting, materials and their quantities are to be 
spelled out. 
(9) ?Materials testing. All testing activities shall be conducted within a building or enclosed 
structure. Outdoor testing of materials and products, such as done by the Portland Cement 
Association, shall be limited to natural weathering only, and is to be located in either side or rear 
yard areas. The materials and products themselves may not exceed 2 stories or 26 feet in 
height. 
(10) ?[Reserved.] 
(11) ?Restricted uses. Uses listed as restricted uses in the district shall be permitted uses and be 
located within buildings containing other unrestricted uses or residences. Residences shall only 
be located south of Old Orchard Road.

Sec. 118-181. - Purpose. 
(a) ?Mixed-use districts are intended to provide for, but not mandate, a vertical mix of commercial, 
institutional, recreational, and residential uses within the same building; a physical pattern of 
development that promotes building designs incorporating environmental sustainability, pedestrian 
orientation, and storefront-style shopping streets consistent with the 2020 Plan for Downtown Skokie: 
Sector A and other updates to the Comprehensive Plan. These districts promote retail sales and the 
health and well being of residents, employees, and consumers by encouraging physical activity, 
alternative transportation, and greater social interaction. 
(b) ?The NX Neighborhood Mixed-Use district is intended for commercial areas adjacent to single-family 
districts that are not adjacent to CX Core Mixed-Use districts. Buildings shall be designed to promote 
walking and pedestrian orientation. Ground floor uses must be commercially used but not 
necessarily reserved for retail and other service uses open to customers. Upper story uses can be 
other commercial uses or residences. Buildings can be up to 39 feet in height, compatible to uses in 
the R1 and R2 Single-Family residential districts. 
(c) ?The TX Transit Mixed-Use district is intended for areas within 2,000 feet of rapid transit or adjacent 
to CX Core Mixed-Use districts. Buildings shall be designed to promote walking and pedestrian 
orientation, with curb cuts discouraged on retail streets. Ground floor uses on commercial streets 
must be reserved for retail and other service uses open to customers. Upper story uses may be 
other commercial uses or residences. Buildings can be up to 75 feet in height, compatible to uses in 
the residential districts that include multifamily housing, but must have a minimum of two usable 
floors along retail streets. Entire blocks shall be zoned TX, where possible, to increase opportunities 
for pedestrian-oriented site and building design, conveniently located public parking, and open 
spaces. 
(d) ?The CX Core Mixed-Use district is intended for areas close to rapid transit hubs and employment 
centers. Buildings shall be designed to promote walking and have a pedestrian orientation, with curb 
cuts on retail streets strongly discouraged. Ground floor uses on retail streets must be reserved for 
retail and other service uses open to customers. Upper story uses may be other commercial uses or 
residences. Taller buildings up to 156 feet in height are encouraged and shall have a minimum of 
two usable floors of building along retail streets. Entire blocks shall be zoned CX, where possible, to 
increase opportunities for pedestrian-oriented site and building design, conveniently located public 
parking, and open spaces.

Sec. 118-182. - Design guidelines. 
    Development of any lot within the district shall be in conformance with Design Guidelines for Mixed-
Use Districts , a set of design guidelines that are approved by the Appearance Commission. These 
guidelines shall assure that buildings, circulation, and open spaces conform to the intent of the district. 
Individual buildings are still subject to the review and approval by the Appearance Commission to assure 
that each conforms to the approved design guidelines.

b. ?On streets not classified as arterials: Not less than 16 feet. 
(5) ?On corner lots, the spacing between the driveway entrance and the right-of-way line of the 
adjacent intersecting street shall be as follows: 
a. ?To intersecting arterials: Not less than 15 feet. 
b. ?To an intersecting street not classified as an arterial: Not less than 8 feet. 
(d) ?Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such 
applicable width and design as set forth in this article in order to provide safe and efficient means of 
vehicular access to such parking space. Tandem parking shall not be allowed to meet off-street 
parking requirements, except as part of a Village-approved plan in designated redevelopment areas 
in the M1 Office Assembly Industry, M2 Light Industry and M3 Industry districts. In these areas 
tandem parking can be provided, however, only the parking spaces on private property that are 
accessed from a public street where there is approved parkway parking shall be allowed to meet off-
street parking requirements. 
(e) ?Vertical clearance. Enclosed parking spaces shall have a vertical clearance of at least 7 feet. All 
pipes, sprinklers, vent fans and other such obstructions shall not encroach into the clearance. 
(f) ?Surfacing. All off-street parking areas shall be fully improved with a pavement meeting the Village 
design standards. This standard shall not apply to storage lots unless such lots are paved. Unpaved 
storage lots shall be surfaced with gravel and drained subject to the approval of the Engineering 
Division.

the pavement surface shall be provided to define each parking space. 
(2) ?Signage and striping shall be in accordance with this Code. 
(i) ?Curbing and walks. 
(1) ?All surface parking lots shall have continuous curbing located a minimum of 6 feet from, and 
parallel to, any property line which is adjacent to a street frontage, except as noted in this 
subsection. 
(2) ?The required continuous curbing may be located closer than 6 feet to the property line when 
the area between the curbing and the property line does not equal more than 10 percent of the 
total area of the off-street parking lot. 
(3) ?Any parking area serving either detached or 2-unit multifamily residences shall be exempt from 
the curbing requirement of this section. 
(4) ?For unimproved existing lots and deficient existing lots which are to be improved, where the 
continuous curbing is not used as wheel stops, such curbing may be closer than 6 feet to the 
property line when it would result in a reduction in the number of standard off-street parking 
spaces or if it would reduce the width of an access aisle or driveway below the minimum 
requirements. 
(5) ?For unimproved existing lots and deficient existing lots which are to be improved, where the 
continuous curbing is used as wheel stops, such curbing may be located up to a minimum of 3 
feet from the property line if the placement of the curbing at a distance of greater than 3 feet 
would result in a reduction in the number of standard off-street parking spaces which were 
previously provided or if it would reduce the width of an access aisle or driveway below the 
minimum requirements. 
(6) ?When the continuous curbing would fall within a utility easement, the requirement must be 
reviewed by the Director of Engineering. The Director of Engineering shall determine, after a 
review of written statements from the public utility companies, whether each utility company is 
now using the easement or plans to do so in the future, and the characteristics of such use, the 
type of utility line, its horizontal and vertical placement, its relationship to other utilities, and the 
access needed for installation and maintenance. When the utility easement is or will be in use, 
the Director of Engineering shall determine whether the continuous curbing on the easement 
will interfere with the utility companies' use of the easement and shall then determine a suitable 
location for the continuous curbing. 
(7) ?If the continuous curbing cannot be so placed as to avoid interference with the utilities, then 
alternate curbing and/or location shall be determined by the Director of Engineering. When none 
of the foregoing are possible, a variance to waive this requirement may be sought from the 
Zoning Board of Appeals, or, if the subject site is under consideration for a special use permit, 
then the waiver of this requirement may be sought from the Plan Commission as part of the 
special use. 
(8) ?Perimeter curbing shall meet the curve of the street curb. Where this continuous street-to-
parking-area curbing meets a pedestrian sidewalk, there shall be no on grade separation. 
(9) ?Continuous curbing shall be required within the interior of an off-street area, to ensure the 
public safety and protect landscaping, or as required by the Director of Engineering. Adequate 
methods of containing vehicular parking shall be provided, subject to the approval of the 
Director of Engineering, if continuous curbing cannot be provided. Such methods shall include 
but not be limited to wheel stops and approved roping devices. 
(10) ?For all new parking lots with aisles, a minimum 5-foot sidewalk shall be provided alongside a 
building abutting an off-street parking area to provide access to the building from the parking 
area. If the building depth (or width) is less than the depth (or width) of the property, the 
sidewalk shall extend beyond the building and run the length (or depth) of the parking area. In 
addition, the minimum 5-foot sidewalk shall be provided at the rear of a building or structure 
behind which aisle parking is provided. 
(11) ?The required sidewalk may be reduced in width to 3 feet under the following circumstances: 
a. ?Where any parking area has direct access to the parking stalls from an alley and is also 
located directly to the rear of the building; and 
b. ?Where the sidewalk abutting the parking area or which provides access to the building from 
the parking area is not in conflict with vehicular traffic maneuvers, including backup 
maneuvers. 
(j) ?Screening and landscaping. 
(1) ?For all new and existing lot improvements, adequate visual screening shall be erected along 
any lot line of a nonresidential property which abuts residentially zoned property and is not 
separated by an alley from such property. If an intervening alley separates residentially zoned 
property from nonresidentially used property, then the visual screening shall be erected 1 foot 
within the side or rear lot line of the nonresidentially used property to screen the off-street 
parking and/or loading areas. 
a. ?Only the following types of visual screening shall be permitted for the purpose of this 
article: 
1. ?Face brick wall. 
2. ?Reinforced concrete wall with decorative finish. 
3. ?Solid board-on-board wooden fence. 
4. ?Dense evergreen living shrubs. 
5. ?A combination of the types of screening listed in this subsection. 
b. ?The height of the required screening shall be 5 feet, except in residentially zoned districts it 
shall be 4 feet. Screening shall not be required in the R1 and R2 residential districts, 
except by special use permit. 
c. ?Where access to an intervening alley is provided from an off-street parking and/or loading 
area, the height of the required screening on either side of the access area shall be 30 
inches for a minimum of 10 feet. 
d. ?All required screening other than permitted screening types shall be subject to the approval 
of the Appearance Commission. 
e. ?All required screening shall be adequately protected from vehicular maneuvers. Protection 
may include wheel stops, curbing, guardrails and/or earth berming. Where required 
screening other than landscaping is provided at an alley, the 1-foot area between the 
property line and the required screening shall be covered with a hard surface, subject to 
the approval of the Director of Engineering. 
f. ?When the required screening would fall in a utility easement or an alley boundary which is 
used by 1 or more of the utility companies for its service, the requirement must be 
reviewed by the Director of Engineering. The Director of Engineering shall determine, after 
a review of written statements from the public utility companies, whether each utility 
company is now using the easement or plans to in the future and the characteristics of 
such use, the type of utility line, its horizontal and vertical placement, its relationship to 
other utilities and the access needed for installation and maintenance. When the utility 
easement is or will be in use, the Director of Engineering shall determine when the 
required screening on a lot would interfere with the utility companies' use of the easement 
and shall then determine a suitable location for such screening. If required screening 
cannot be so placed to avoid interference with the utilities, alternate screening and location 
shall be determined by the Director of Engineering and the Director of Community 
Development. 
(k) ?Lighting. 
(1) ?Lighting shall be required for all new commercial and industrial off-street parking areas. 
Lighting shall also be required for all residential parking areas with more than 20 spaces. 
Residential developments consisting of only detached residences shall be exempt. 
(2) ?Any lighting shall be directed away from abutting or adjacent properties, streets, or public 
rights-of-way. 
(3) ?The illumination level for all off-street parking areas shall be as follows: 
a. ?The illumination level for an off-street parking area shall be an average maintained 
horizontal footcandle ratio of 1.0 to 3.0 footcandles or per IES required standards for other 
application purposes. 
b. ?Uniform illumination is desirable, and the lowest footcandle value at any point on the 
pavement should not be less than ¼ the designed average maintained horizontal 
footcandles. 
c. ?The type of luminaries, shielding, pole height and the lighting design, uniformity ratio and 
the entire lighting scheme shall be subject to the approval of the Village Traffic Engineer. 
All lighting units shall be of the full cutoff type.

(1) ?[ Required. ] The preservation of trees is required for all public and private new construction, 
enlargement or expansion of buildings or structures and other increases in impermeable surface 
over 600 square feet in area in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(2) ?Tree removal permit. Trees having a diameter of 8 inches or greater measured at 4.5 feet 
above the ground line, at construction sites described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, shall 
not be removed without first obtaining a tree removal permit. The only exception to this 
requirement shall be in emergency situations posing a threat to a person, property, or the 
community where such emergency renders compliance with the permit process unreasonable. 
The person removing the tree must contact the Community Development Department within 48 
hours of the removal of the tree. 
(3) ?[ Submissions. ] Prior to the issuance of a building permit and/or tree removal permit, a tree 
survey, final grading plan, and tree preservation plan shall be submitted to the Community 
Development Department for review and approval. 
a. ?Tree survey. The tree survey shall be indicated on a recent plat of survey, with land 
contours, and include the location and size of all trees 8 inches or greater in diameter. 
b. ?Final grading plan. The final grading plan shall integrate the existing trees on the tree 
survey to be preserved into the proposed development. If the Community Development 
Department determines that integration of trees into the final grading plan cannot be 
accomplished, the developer or property owner may remove the trees in dispute and 
replace the trees with new trees based upon the exchange rate set forth in subsection (5) 
of this section. 
c. ?Tree preservation plan. The tree preservation plan shall indicate the location and species of 
those trees to be preserved and the methods to be used to preserve such trees. This plan 
shall also indicate the protective fencing of trees, methods of protecting trees from 
construction activities, material storage, and the protection of trees and vegetation on 
adjacent property along the property line. The plan shall be in compliance with the Village 
of Skokie Standard Tree Protection Requirements for Construction Projects. 
(4) ?Removal of trees. 
a. ?Trees approved for removal for which a permit has been issued shall be removed prior to 
the implementation of the final grading plan. 
b. ?Removal of trees designated for preservation shall be allowed by amending the final 
grading plan with the approval of the Director of Community Development or designee. The 
amended plan shall indicate the location and size of all trees being removed and all 
replacement trees in accordance with the approval of the Director of Community 
Development or designee. 
c. ?Field adjustments to trees designated for preservation on the preservation plan may be 
necessary during the course of the construction. In such instances, the developer or 
property owner shall not remove any trees designated for preservation prior to site 
inspection and approval by the Director of Community Development or designee. 
Adjustments approved by the Director of Community Development or designee shall be 
reflected on the final grading plan. 
(5) ?Replacement of trees. 
a. ?The replacement of trees 8 inches or greater in diameter and trees designated for 
preservation shall be replaced with new trees from the approved list of trees by the Village 
Forester, each of which shall have a minimum diameter of 2.5 inches measured at a 
distance of 6 inches above ground level. Trees shall be replaced based on the Village of 
Skokie Parkway Tree Removal and Replacement Policy, as amended from time to time, 
within 6 months of the tree removal. These trees must be planted on site in accordance 
with an approved grading plan. If the Director of Community Development or designee 
determines that adequate or suitable space is not available on site for the replacement 
trees the developer shall pay into a tree fund for the trees, based on the Village of Skokie 
Parkway Tree Removal and Replacement Policy. 
b. ?Any relocated or replaced trees shall be guaranteed survival for up to one growing season. 
In the event that a relocated or replaced tree dies or is in declining condition, the tree shall 
be replaced with a new 2.5-inch diameter tree. 
(b) ?Any development subject to the provisions of this chapter shall provide a landscape plan to be 
approved by Village Manager or designee and the Village Appearance Commission. The landscape 
plan shall include existing and proposed plantings, including species, spacing, quantity, and size, 
areas to be sodded, and locations and specifications of other materials. The landscape plan shall 
address all requirements of this chapter. 
(c) ?Maximum feasible (live) landscaping shall be provided. 
(1) ?For existing developments, landscaping shall be provided at parking lots between the property 
line and the continuous curbing adjacent to street frontages. 
(2) ?For new developments, additions and uses requiring a special use permit, landscaping shall be 
provided along street frontages, along the perimeter and interior of parking lot areas, and 
adjacent to buildings and other areas of the site not dedicated to parking, drives, sidewalks or 
other improvements. 
(d) ?All unpaved areas not planted by trees, shrubs, ground cover, etc., shall be sodded. Grass seeding 
shall not be allowed. 
(e) ?New parking lots and improved existing commercial lots shall provide, at a minimum, 1 tree within 
the interior of the parking area for every 15 parking spaces. Open sales lots and storage lots shall be 
exempt from this landscaping requirement. Trees to be used in the interior portions of parking areas 
shall be limited to those on the "Approved Species for Parking Lot Tree Planting" list, approved by 
the Village Manager or designee as may be amended from time to time. All trees shall have a 
minimum trunk diameter of 2.5 inches measured at a distance of 6 inches above ground level. 
(f) ?Trees, shrubs, ground cover and other plants selected for planting at a site shall be acclimated to 
Northern Illinois. 
(g) ?Planting used for screening shall be a combination of tall, low and wide shrubbery. 
(h) ?Earth berms banked on both sides, or with 1 side banked toward the yard boundary line and a 
retaining wall, shall have a maximum side slope ratio of 3 to 1 for ease of maintenance. The 
embankment ratio shall be indicated on the required landscape plan. 
(i) ?Perimeter curbing, landscaping timbers, railroad ties, etc., shall be used to delineate and protect 
landscaped areas from motor vehicles. 
(Zon. Ord., § 14.3; Ord. No. 03-11-Z-3222, §§ 1, 2, 11-3-2003; Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 5, 10-
7-2013) 


Sec. 118-234. - Maintenance. 
(a) ?All landscaping on public or private property that is part of an approved development plan shall be 
properly maintained, by the owner of the development, in a vigorous growing condition. Any 
landscaping which has been permitted to deteriorate shall be replaced. 
(b) ?All shrubbery, trees, plants or vegetation within a 10-foot sight distance triangle in R1, R2, R3, and 
R4 districts, or within a 15-foot sight distance triangle in all other districts, shall not exceed 30 inches 
in height. 
(c) ?Shrubbery planted in such a manner as to create a continuous barrier along a street frontage of a 
property shall not exceed 4 feet in height, except in mixed-use, business, and industrial districts 
where the purpose of the landscaping is to screen outdoor storage or along the side or rear yards of 
residential property. 
(d) ?The entire site must be free of weeds, including areas behind required screening and along fences. 
(e) ?The property owner shall sign an agreement for installation and maintenance of landscaping with 
the Village. This agreement recognizes that the installation and maintenance of landscaping is an 
integral part of the property owner's plan for the development and/or use of the property and is 
necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of the Village's land use objectives, and that the 
permits would not have been approved by the Village without the assurance that this agreement 
would be executed by the property owner. The purpose of this agreement is to ensure installation of 
the landscaping in accordance with the landscaping plan approved by the Village, and continued 
maintenance and care of the landscaping, including any landscaping indicated in the parkway. 
(Zon. Ord., § 14.4; Ord. No. 08-6-C-3621, § 1, 6-2-2008; Ord. No. 09-1-C-3657, § 2, 1-5-2009; 
Ord. No. 11-3-C-3823, § 1, 3-7-2011; Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 5, 10-7-2013) 


Sec. 118-235. - Relief. 
    When the landscaping required pursuant to this article for an existing development will interfere with 
required off-street parking, loading, driveway or aisle facilities, or the site is dimensionally deficient to 
provide landscaping pursuant to this article, the Director of Community Development and the Director of 
Engineering may require alternate landscaping requirements.

occupied by a conforming use in compliance with this chapter. Any nonconforming use without a 
valid certificate of occupancy is prohibited to be reestablished upon vacancy. 
(b) ?Damage. If any nonconforming structure or use is, by any cause, damaged to the extent of 50% of 
its value immediately prior to the event as determined by the Zoning Official, it shall only be 
reconstructed in compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 6, 10-7-2013) 


Sec. 118-253. - Enlargements and modifications. 
(a) ?Maintenance and repair. Maintenance, repairs, and alterations to structures shall be permitted to 
nonconforming structures or to a building housing a nonconforming use with valid permits.

Sec. 118-254. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a) ?No lot of record may be improved unless it is in conformity with the requirements of this chapter, 
except that a lot of record in a residential district that does not meet the requirements of this chapter 
as to area or lot width may nonetheless be improved for a detached residence in the district, 
provided that it shall meet all the other requirements of this chapter. 
(b) ?Where 2 or more abutting lots shown in a plat properly recorded with the office of the County 
Recorder are held or become held in common legal or equitable ownership at any time subsequent 
to March 2, 1965, and the use of such abutting lots as separate parcels would not meet the 
requirements of this chapter, the ownership of the lots shall not be separated nor shall any of the lots 
be used in any way to conflict with the regulations of this chapter. No building permits shall be issued 
for the use of any lot or portion of lot sold, transferred or conveyed in violation of the provisions of 
this section; provided, however, that this provision shall not prevent the dividing of presently existing 
townhouses and multifamily residences into separate ownership units.

--- (13) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 19-4-C-4451, § 1, adopted April 15, 2019, renumbered Art. VII as Art. XIV. 


Sec. 118-271. - General. 
(a) ?Approval. Planned developments (PDs) are allowed with site plan approval in all zoning districts. No 
PD shall be granted unless it conforms to the use limitations, densities, bulk regulations, and design 
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, except as those requirements may be lawfully 
modified as allowed by this chapter. Compliance with the regulations of this chapter in no way 
excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of the subdivision chapter of this code, 
unless those modifications are specifically authorized in the approval of the PD. 
(b) ?Intent. These regulations are to encourage and provide means to promote desirable and quality 
development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom than is permitted under the basic 
district regulations and to accomplish a well-balanced, aesthetically-satisfying, and economically-
desirable development of building sites within a PD. These regulations are established to permit 
latitude in the development of the building site if such development is found to be in accordance with 
the purpose, spirit, and intent of this chapter and is found not to be hazardous, harmful, offensive, or 
otherwise adverse to the environment, property values, or the character of the neighborhood or the 
health, safety and welfare of the community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification 
and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces, and bulk requirements for 
developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is 
further intended to encourage more rational development with relationship to public services, 
preservation of open lands, and storm water management. 
(Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 7, 10-7-2013) 


Sec. 118-272. - Conditions. 
(a) ?Exceptions to use. A PD may only contain allowable uses listed in Appendix A of this chapter for the 
zoning district in which it is located, except as listed in this section with a special use permit for the 
additional uses and based on findings of fact for a special use permit. 
(1) ?Sites in multiple districts. If a site is located in more than 1 zoning district, the uses applicable 
to such property in 1 district may be extended into the adjacent district as part of the special use 
permit. 
(2) ?Proportionate exception. Up to 20% of the ground floor area or 20% of the gross floor area of 
the PD may be devoted to additional uses listed in Appendix A. 
(b) ?Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or 
the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property. 
(c) ?Design. The Commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces within the 
site development plan as necessary to ensure that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected. 
(1) ?Density. When units per acre requirements exist, the number of units per acre may be 
increased in no case higher than 9.6 in R1, 12.1 in R2, 23.2 in R3 and, 24.8 in R4. 
(2) ?Floor area ratio (FAR). When FARs requirements exist, the FAR may be increased in no case 
higher than what may be allowed in the zoning district with site plan approval, except for 
demonstration projects in (6). 
(3) ?Arrangement. Where feasible, the height and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged in 
a way that is complementary with the regulations of adjacent and abutting districts. 
(4) ?Specific regulations. The area of lots, lot width, required yards, and coverage regulations shall 
be determined by site plan approval. 
(5) ?Specific design requirements. Additional relief may be granted from design requirements only 
when such relief is consistent with the purpose of the district and the Comprehensive Plan. 
(6) ?Demonstration projects. Relief may be granted from FAR and height requirements beyond the 
maximum allowed in the zoning district. The calculation of the FAR may also be reduced by the 
floor area of the parking spaces that are required for residence uses and adjacent driveways 
that would otherwise be calculated in the FAR. 
(d) ?Open spaces. Preservation, maintenance, and ownership of required open spaces within the PD 
shall be accomplished by either: 
(1) ?A dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system, or 
(2) ?Creating a permanent open space easement on and over the said private open spaces to 
guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and 
maintenance being the responsibility of an owners' association established with articles of 
association and bylaws, which are satisfactory to the Village Board. 
(e) ?Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing, screening, grading, and drainage related to the uses within the 
site and as a means of integrating the proposed PD into its surroundings must planned and 
presented to the Commission for approval, together with other required plans for the PD. 
    A planting plan showing proposed trees, shrubs, and other perennial plantings shall be prepared for 
the entire site to be developed. 
(f) ?Signs. If relief is requested from the Signs chapter, the size, location, design and nature of signs 
relevant to the relief detailed in the application must be presented to the Commission for approval. 
(g) ?Additional findings of fact. In addition to the findings of fact for site plan approval, the Commission 
must make the following findings for PDs: 
(1) ?The proposed use of the particular site, including any exceptions to use, shall be shown as 
necessary or desirable to provide a service, amenity, or facility that will contribute to the general 
well-being of the surrounding area. 
(2) ?Under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the 
health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing within or in the vicinity of the PD. 
(Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 7, 10-7-2013; Ord. No. 16-8-C-4241, § 1, 8-1-2016) 


Sec. 118-273. - Intent and authorization to make requirements. 
(a) ?Professional expertise. Site and building plans for a PD must be prepared by a designer or team of 
designers having professional competence in urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, 
and engineering, as proposed in the application. The Commission shall be permitted to require the 
applicant to engage additional professional expertise if it deems the application team is lacking such 
services. 
(b) ?Design. It is the intent of this section that the design control exercised be the minimum necessary to 
achieve the purpose of this section. 
(c) ?Conditions. The Commission is authorized to recommend approval or disapproval of an application 
for a PD and to attach any conditions it deems necessary to secure compliance with the purposes 
set forth in this chapter. 
(d) ?Contributions. The Village Board, as part of the approval of a PD, is permitted to require an 
applicant to make reasonable contributions , including, but not limited to, any combination of the 
following: 
(1) ?Dedication of land for public park purposes. 
(2) ?Dedication of land for public school purposes.

addition is reasonably related to the traffic to be generated. 
(5) ?Installation and maintenance costs of required traffic safety devices. 
(6) ?Installation of lighting, landscaping, sidewalks, and bus shelters on public right-of-way and 
private property. 
(7) ?Preservation of areas containing significant natural, environmental, historic, archeological or 
similar resources. 
(Ord. No. 13-10-C-4010, § 7, 10-7-2013) 


Sec. 118-274. - Commission action. 
(a) ?Approval. The Commission has the authority to require that the following conditions for a PD 
(among others it deems appropriate) be met by the applicant: 
(1) ?That the applicants intend to start construction within 1 year of either the approval of the project 
or of any necessary zoning district change, and intend to complete said construction, or 
approved stages thereof, within 4 years from the date construction begins. 
(2) ?That the PD is planned as 1 complex land use rather than as an aggregation of individual and 
unrelated buildings and uses. 
(b) ?Limitations on application. 
(1) ?Upon approval of a PD by the Village Board, construction must proceed only in accordance 
with the approved ordinance. 
(2) ?An amendment to approved plans and specifications for a PD must be obtained only by 
following the procedures in this chapter.
