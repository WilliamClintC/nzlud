WEED MUNICIPAL CODE 1978 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Weed, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Weed, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1978, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of J.P. Correia, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 454-2019, passed June 13, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06 can be added between 2.04 and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 6, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 6, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 6, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

Chapter 3.28 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX[7] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
For statutory provisions authorizing local transient occupancy taxes, see Rev. and Tax. Code §§7280 and 7281. 
 
3.28.010 - Title. 
The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. 68-66 §1, 1966).  
3.28.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  Hotel. "Hotel" means any structure or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, and shall also include any campground, mobile home park, trailer park, recreational vehicle park, or similar places where outdoor living spaces are rented to transients. 
B.  Occupancy. "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and shall also include the use or possession of any outdoor space for camping or occupation by a trailer, mobile home, or recreational vehicle. 
C.  Operator. "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  Person. "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee or syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  Rent. "Rent" means the consideration charge, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  Tax administrator. "Tax administrator" means the city clerk. 
G.  Transient. "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or fewer, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying a space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. 
(Ord. 266-89 §§1, 2, 1989; Ord. 190-78 §1, 1978; Ord. 68-66 §2, 1966).  
3.28.030 - Tax imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the city clerk may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city clerk. 
(Ord. 316-93 §1, 1993: Ord. 266-89 §3, 1989: Ord. 209-78 §1, 1978: Ord. 95-69 §1, 1969: Ord. 68-66 §3, 1966).  
3.28.040 - Exemptions. 
A.  No tax shall be imposed upon any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
B.  No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the city clerk. 
(Ord. 68-66 §4, 1966).  
3.28.050 - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. 68-66 §5, 1966).  
3.28.060 - Registration. 
A.  Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the city clerk, and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate, to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. 
B.  Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
1.  The name of the operator; 
2.  The address of the hotel; 
3.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
4.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the City Clerk for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the City Clerk. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 68-66 §6, 1966).  
3.28.070 - Reporting and remitting.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the city clerk. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established, in a manner prescribed by the city clerk, that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the city clerk, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the city clerk that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right to such refund by written records showing entitlement thereto.

5.10.135 - Successor and assignee responsibility. 
A.  If any person, while liable for any amount under this chapter, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers half or more of a commercial cannabis business, whether voluntarily or involuntarily; the person's successor, assignee or other transferee, or other person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the business ("transferee") shall satisfy pay that amount when due. A transferee shall notify the city manager of a transfer thirty days before the transfer date; or if the agreement to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the commercial cannabis business is made less than thirty days before the date of transfer, on the first day city hall is open for business after the transfer. 
B.  A transferee shall be deemed to have satisfied an unpaid liability if the transferee complies with the requirements of California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5 and this section by withholding from the purchase price, for the benefit of the city, an amount sufficient to cover the liability, or by otherwise paying the liability and obtaining from the city manager a "tax clearance certificate" showing that all outstanding liability has been paid through the date of transfer. 
C.  Within ninety days of receiving a written request from a transferee, the city manager may issue a "tax clearance certificate" stating either the amount due as to the business under this chapter, or stating that there is no liability due for the business through a stated date. The city manager may also request financial records from the transferor to audit the amount due under this chapter. The city manager shall issue a tax clearance certificate within thirty days of completing the audit, stating any amount owed, unless the city manager determines the records provided for audit are insufficient to determine whether taxes, fees, penalties and/or interest are due and in what amounts. If so, the city manager may rely on available information to estimate any amount due and shall issue a tax clearance certificate stating that amount. A written application for an appeal hearing on the amount assessed on a tax clearance certificate must be made within ten days after the city manager serves or mails the certificate. If a timely application for a hearing is not made, the tax clearance certificate shall serve as conclusive evidence of the liability under this chapter associated with the business through the date stated on the certificate.

In applying this subsection, the planning commission shall not consider such removal to be necessary for a private improvement unless the applicant has actually applied for, and has paid plan checking fees for a building permit for the subject improvements. The request to remove a tree shall not be denied if the applicant shows that the tree would unreasonably interfere with a building, road, or other necessary appropriate improvement, or with grading required for appropriate drainage, and parking areas necessary to provide for sufficient use of the property so as to make a project economically feasible; 
C.  The number of mature trees existing on the subject property; 
D.  Good forestry practices, i.e., the number of healthy mature trees that a given area will support, and stem spacing no greater than twenty-five feet. This also applies to Section 8.28.060;

C.  Trees planted, grown, or held for sale by a licensed nursery; 
D.  Christmas tree farms; 
E.  Dead or diseased trees. 
(Ord. 328-95 §4, 1995; Ord. 284-91 §1(part), 1991).  
8.28.090 - Trees on city lands and rights-of-way. 
The following procedure shall be followed for removal of trees from any lands owned or leased by the city, or over which the city has any easement or right-of-way: 
A.  The director may issue a permit for the removal of any of the following, without first submitting the same to the planning commission: 
1.  Trees deemed by the director to be necessary to obtain adequate line-of-sight distances for public streets or roads; 
2.  Trees within or adjacent to the public right-of-way which, in the opinion of the director, will likely cause damage to existing public improvements. 
B.  Before issuing such a permit, the director shall, not less than fifteen days in advance, cause to be posted in a conspicuous place at City Hall, and mailed to every owner of real property within one hundred feet of the subject tree, a notice of the director's intention to issue the permit. Thereafter, not later than fifteen days after such mailing and posting, whichever is later, any interested person may protest, in writing, the proposed issuance of the permit. 
C.  Any protest of a proposed permit under this section shall be considered by the planning commission within forty-five days. If the planning commission fails to act on the protest within forty-five days, the protest shall be deemed rejected, unless both the director and the protesting party have agreed to extend such time. 
(Ord. 284-91 §1(part), 1991).  
8.28.100 - Appeals. 
Decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 18.40 of this code. 
(Ord. 284-91 §1(part), 1991).  
8.28.110 - Fees. 
The city council may, from time to time, by resolution, set fees for all tree cutting permits required hereunder, which shall reimburse the city's expenses for processing applications and the other costs of regulation and enforcement.

(Ord. 346-99 §1, 1999: Ord. 284-91 §1(part), 1991).  
8.28.130 - Compliance with other laws and regulations.

B.  Ownership or Control. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any proposed change in, transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major partners or stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of persons of twenty-five percent of the aggregate partnership interests in or voting share of the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto, except as provided in subsection (A) of this section. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change in ownership or control of the grantee, the grantee shall have the responsibility to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the city: 
1.  Whether the proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the "proposed transferee") which, in the case of a partnership or corporation, shall include all partners, officers, directors, and all persons having a legal or equitable interest in five percent or more of its partnership interests or voting stock, or any of the proposed transferee's principals; 
a.  Has never been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral turpitude or is presently under an indictment, investigation or complaint charging such acts; or 
b.  Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, or misrepresentation entering against it, her, him, or them by any court of competent jurisdiction; or 
c.  Has pending against it, her, him, or them any legal claim, lawsuit, or administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable communications system; and 
2.  Whether the proposed transferee has the financial and technical capability to enable it to maintain and operate the cable communications system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise provisions. 
C.  Right of Lender to Operate System. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the cable communications system operating under authority of such franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city will take control and operate the cable communications system in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the city in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to franchise to another grantee. If, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualities of the proposed transferee, the city finds that such transfer is satisfactory, the city will approve the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise to such proposed transferee. 
D.  No Transfer Before Completion of Construction. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction or reconstruction of the proposed cable communications system. 
E.  Transferee to Assume Grantee's Obligations under Franchise. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest to the grantee assuming all of the grantee's obligations under its franchise. Notwithstanding the requirements of the grantee's franchise, the city may require, as a condition of the transfer of such franchise, that the proposed transferee furnish either or both a security fund and a performance bond in such amount or amounts as the city shall designate. 
F.  Permitted Encumbrances. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the grantee may pledge, assign, hypothecate, or create a security interest in its franchise without the consent of the city in favor of any bank, financial institution, or other lender with respect to any indebtedness of the grantee to such person. 
(Ord. 272-89 §1 (part), 1990).

14.06.040 - Definitions. 
The following definitions will apply to interpretation of this chapter. 
A.  "Air gap separation" means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle, and must be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case may the gap be less than one inch. 
B.  "Auxiliary supply" means any water source or system other than the public potable water system, that may be available in the building or on the premises. 
C.  "Backflow" means the reversal of flow, other than in the intended direction into the distribution of the public water system, from a service connection. 
1.  "Back pressure" means the backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the city water supply. 
2.  "Back siphonage" means a form of backflow due to a negative or sub-atmospheric pressure within the water system. 
D.  "Backflow prevention device" means a state-approved device to counteract back pressure or prevent back siphonage. 
E.  "Cross-connection" means any physical arrangement whereby a public water system is connected directly or indirectly, with any other nonpotable water system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage, reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination into the public water system as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, movable sections, swivel or changeover devices, or other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of which, backflow could occur, are considered to be cross-connections. 
F.  "Double check valve assembly (DCVA)" means an approved assembly composed of two single, independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the watertightness of each check valve which are approved by the State of California Department of Health. 
G.  "Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device (RPBD)" means an approved device incorporating two or more check valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two checks, two shutoff valves, and equipped with the necessary appurtenances for testing. The device must operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves, less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve the differential relief valve must operate to maintain the reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure drops below two pounds per square inch, the relief valve must open to the atmosphere thereby providing an atmospheric zone between the two check valves. 
(Ord. 257-87 (part), 1987).  
14.06.050 - Cross-connections prohibited. 
A.  Except as provided below, all cross-connections, whether or not they are controlled by automatic devices such as check valves or by hand operated mechanisms such as gate valves or stop clocks, are prohibited. 
B.  Failure on the part of persons, firms, or corporations to discontinue the use of all cross-connections and to physically separate cross-connections is sufficient cause for the immediate discontinuance of public water services to the premises. 
(Ord. 257-87 (part), 1987).  
14.06.060 - Installation of backflow prevention device. 
Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service connection or within any premises where in the judgment of the director of public works the nature and extent of activity on the premises, materials used in connection with the activities, or materials stored on the premises would present an immediate or potential hazard to the public's health should a cross-connection flow occur, even though such cross-connection does not exist at the time the backflow prevention device is required to be installed. This includes: 
A.  Premises having an auxiliary water supply; 
B.  Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impracticable to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist; 
C.  Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure that cross-connections do not exist; 
D.  Premises having a history of cross-connections being established or reestablished; 
E.  Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public water system, or where a cross-connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This includes the handling of process waters and cooling waters; 
F.  Premises with commercial or residential water softener units (backwash); 
G.  Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled such that if backflow should occur, a serious health hazard may result; 
H.  The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above categories where a backflow prevention device shall be installed at these facilities as set forth in the California Administrative Code, Title 17-Public Health, unless the director of public works determines that no health hazard exists: 
1.  Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics,

14.06.070 - Types of backflow prevention devices required. 
The type of prevention device required by the city depends on the degree of hazard which exists as follows: 
A.  An air-gap separation or reduced pressure backflow prevention device shall be installed where the water supply may be contaminated by sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other contaminant which would cause a health hazard. 
B.  In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, air-gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed. 
C.  Pressure type vacuum breaker units (spring loaded) are the approved units for city supplied irrigation systems. The unit must be installed at least twelve inches above the highest fixture point of water usage and in such a manner that drainage will preclude back pressure. 
(Ord. 257-87 (part), 1987).  
14.06.080 - Location. 
Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter must be installed at the meter, at the property line of the premises when meters are not used, or at a location designated by the director of public works.

14.08.050 - Liquid waste disposal policy—General statement. 
A.  The city operates the Weed sewage facility, serving homes, industries and commercial establishments within the city limits and a certain industrial user holding a contractual right for such service within the area immediately adjacent to the city. 
B.  The following basic city policies apply to regulate waste discharges within the area served and will also apply to other discharges that are tributary to the city's facilities. 
C.  Generally, liquid wastes originating within the area served will be removed by the city's sewerage system provided that the wastes will not damage structures, create nuisances such as odors, menace public health, impose unreasonable collection, treatment or disposal costs on the city, interfere with wastewater treatment processes, exceed quality requirements set by regulatory government agencies, or detrimentally affect the local environment. 
D.  The highest and best use of the city's sewerage system is the conveyance, treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater. 
E.  To comply with the stated policies of the federal government and to permit the city to meet increasingly higher standards of treatment plant effluent quality, provisions are made in this chapter for the regulation of industrial wastewater discharges. This chapter establishes quantity and quality limitations on industrial wastewater discharges which may adversely affect the city's sewerage system or effluent quality. Methods of cost recovery from industrial wastewater dischargers are also established where the discharges impose inequitable collection, treatment or disposal costs on the city. 
F.  Recovery and reuse procedures established by industrial wastewater discharges to meet the limitations set on their discharges will be preferred by the city over those procedures designed solely to meet wastewater discharge limitations. Methods providing for beneficial reuse of otherwise wasted resources shall be the approved method of industrial wastewater treatment whenever feasible. 
G.  Optimum use of the facilities of the city may necessitate that the director of public works, in this chapter sometimes referred to as the director, require that certain industrial wastewaters be discharged during periods of low flow in the sewerage system of the city.

(Ord. 355-2001 §1, 2001).  
14.08.260 - Connection-Payment of charges. 
A.  Sewer connection fees on both new buildings and remodels shall be due and payable at the time a building permit is requested for that work of improvement; when the amount thereof is to be based on the number of water closets to be constructed, that number shall be as shown on the plans, except as provided in subsection B of this section. 
B.  The building official may defer the payment of the connection fee, if at the time of applying for a building permit, the owner certifies that the rough plumbing for a water closet is for future use or expansion only, that it will not immediately be placed into service, and requests a deferral of the payment of the connection fee until the finish plumbing is installed and the water closet is placed into service. If the fee is deferred in this manner, the fee shall be due and payable prior to placing the water close into service. If the property owner makes such an installation, or places the water closet into service, prior to payment of the deferred connection fee, a penalty equal to one hundred percent thereof shall be levied against such owner. The amount of any deferred connection fee shall be the amount required by the city at the time of payment, rather than the original amount which was deferred. 
C.  This section shall not apply to residential dwelling units. 
(Ord. 306-93 §1, 1993: Ord. 74-66 §12, 1966).  
14.08.270 - Water pollution control facility-Funding-Requirements. 
A.  The purpose of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380 is to provide a system of charges to assure that each recipient of waste treatment services will pay his, her or its proportionate share of the costs of operation, maintenance, initial capital investment and capital reserve accruals (wastewater capital investment fund). "Initial capital investment," within the meaning of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380, refers to the direct initial capital costs incurred by the city in the construction of the water pollution control facility exclusive of the initial grant funds provided by the United States government, the state and either or both of them. 
B.  The elements of the Weed water pollution control facility sought to be funded by Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380 are the following: 
1.  Water pollution control facility, per se; 
2.  Collection system, repair of existing lines; 
3.  Collection system, replacement and additions; 
4.  Collection system, replacement and additions for future capacity. 
(Ord. 216-78 §1, 1978).

(Ord. 216-78 §2(part), 1978).  
14.08.290 - Connection charqes. 
The total charges for initial connection of residential and other users to the city sewage system shall include a connection to main fee and charges for capital costs of the system. 
A.  Connection Fees. The connection to the main fee shall be a minimum of two hundred dollars. The charges for capital costs of the sewerage system will be based on an established fee of two thousand dollars (household equivalent base rate), effective on each July 1st, according to changes in the Consumer Price Index as follows: 
The index for computing the adjustment is the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose Index for all Urban Consumers published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982-84 = 100). The base under that index shall be the figure published for April, 1992. 
B.  Additions to Existing Businesses. The household equivalent base rate and household equivalent multipliers shall be applied to any covered plumbing facilities which are added to existing businesses. 
C.  Sewer Connection Charge Equivalent Rate Structure. The city council finds that the connection charge equivalent rate structure set forth below reasonably reflects the actual costs of same to the city.

D.  Calculation of Total Connection Charge. Example: In order to determine the total connection charge, the household equivalent base rate is multiplied by the household equivalent multiplier. For example, a food service operation with three public water closets, one kitchen sink and one dishwasher is computed as follows: 
3 water closets 	× 1.33 × $2,000.00 (base rate)       = 	$ 7,980.00 
1 kitchen sink 	× 1.00 × 2,000.00       = 	2,000.00 
1 dishwasher 	× 0.03 × 2,000.00       = 	600.00 
		
		$10,580.00 
estimated charge for city labor and 	
materials to make the physical connection 	$ 200.00 
Total connection charge 	$10,780.00 
 
E.  Negotiated Charges. As an incentive to business development, and to reflect the fact that the true cost to the city of connections to some businesses may not always be accurately reflected in the published schedules, the city council reserves the right to defer the connection fees, capital costs, and other charges for major projects within the system. 
The deferment of payment shall be evidenced by a written agreement executed by the parties. 
Deferments hereunder shall not exceed seven years as follows: no payment is due the first year; payments thereafter will be billed in equal interest free annual installments at the commencement of the second and third years; payment thereafter will be billed with interest in equal annual installments at the commencement of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years. Interest rates will be prime at Tri Counties Bank or its successor. There is no penalty for prepayment. 
For the purposes of this subsection, a "major project" is defined as one which, in the opinion of the city council, is likely to result in any of the following: 
1.  Full-time employment, or equivalent, in excess of ten persons at any time during the first twelve months of operation; 
2.  Sales tax revenues to the city during the first twelve months in an amount greater than the scheduled total connection charge as provided in subsection A of this section; 
3.  Significant transient occupancy tax (TOT) revenues or other benefit to the city. 
Nothing herein shall obligate the city council to negotiate charges which differ from the published rates. The decision of the city council in all matters related to this subsection shall be final. 
F.  Labor and Materials. In addition to connection fees hereinabove, the customer will be charged for actual labor and materials used in making the physical connection from the main to the customer's line. Unless prior to having the connection made the customer has requested and received an estimate of charges from the director of public works, the customer shall be billed for actual time and materials. 
(Ord. No. 397-2010, § 1, 4-8-2010; Ord. 331-95, § 1, 1995; Ord. 320-94, § 1, 1994; Ord. 296-93, § 1, 1993; Ord. 287-92, §§ 2, 3, 1992; Ord. 277-90, § 1, 1990; Ord. 216-78, § 2(I), 1978).  
14.08.300 - Basic service charges. 
The basic service charge shall be computed annually by adding all costs of operation and maintenance to the annual amount set aside for capital reserve accrual, and the annual amount necessary to amortize the initial capital investment of the city over a period of forty years; the sum of all such expenses being then apportioned in accordance with the following: 
The basic user rates are derived from the following formula: 
Cu = 1.1(CovVu + CobBu) + (CdvVu + CdbBu) + CiiNcu + CaaFaa 
Where: 
Cu = Annual rate to be charged to user (dollars) 
Vu = Annual volume contributed by user (million gallons) 
Bu = Annual B.O.D. contributed by user (pounds) 
Cov = Annual unit cost of operation and maintenance attributable to volume ($/MG) 
Cob = Annual unit cost of operation and maintenance attributable to B.O.D. ($/lb) 
Cdv = Annual unit cost of debt service attributable to volume ($/MG) 
Cdb = Annual unit cost of debt service attributable to B.O.D. ($/lb) 
Cii = Annual unit cost of handling infiltration and inflow ($/equivalent connection) 
Caa = Annual unit cost of administration and accounting (dollars) 
Ncu = Number of equivalent service lateral connections of user (a rational factor based on one normal residential building having Ncu = 1) 
Faa = A rational factor for allocating administrative and accounting costs (fixed-rate users, Faa = 1.0 per account; variable-rate users, Faa = 2.0; apartment buildings, Faa = 2.0; schedule on file in the office of the city clerk.) 
(Ord. 216-78 §2(II), 1978).  
14.08.310 - Industrial cost recovery fees. 
In addition to the basic user rate, industrial users will be charged industrial cost recovery fees which must be collected by the city and repaid to the United States government. Industrial cost recovery fees are calculated from the following formula: 
Cicr = $146.65 Vu + $0.010090 Bu. 
For the purposes of this section, "industrial user" means any user who contributes more than twenty-five thousand gallons of wastewater per day, or more than forty-two pounds of B.O.D. or of suspended solids per day. 
(Ord. 216-78 §2(III), 1978).  
14.08.330 - Statements required for determination of charges. 
A.  The city administrator and the city council may require of any person who applies for connection to, or whose premises are connected with, the sewer system of the city to file a statement or affidavit for the guidance of the city administrator, and the city in ascertaining the amount of the service charge or rental payable under Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380, which statement or affidavit shall contain the information as may be required. A failure of such person to file such statement or affidavit containing the information requested or required is a violation of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380. 
B.  No statement or affidavit shall be deemed conclusive as to the matters set forth therein nor shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable under the provisions of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380. 
C.  The information furnished or secured pursuant to this section shall be confidential and any unwarranted disclosures or use of such information by any officer or employee of the city, constitutes a misdemeanor, and such officer or employee shall be subject to the penalty provisions of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380 for the violation of this section. 
(Ord. 216-78 §7, 1978).  
14.08.340 - Payment of bills. 
A.  Periodic bills are due and payable on the date of presentation and become delinquent fifteen days after presentation. Payment may be made at the city clerk's office or by mail. 
B.  Ten percent is added to the total amount of each bill as follows: 
1.  For billing dated the first day of the month, ten percent will be added on the fifth day of the following month after presentation; 
2.  For billing dated the fifteenth day of the month, ten percent will be added on the twentieth day of the following month after presentation. 
C.  Closing bills, if service is closed or discontinued, are due and payable on the date of presentation.

14.08.350 - Delinquent payments-Penalty fee. 
On charges specified in Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380, there shall be a basic penalty of ten percent of each month's charges for the first month delinquent. In addition to the basic penalty, there shall be a further penalty of one-half of one percent per month for nonpayment of the charges and basic penalty. 
(Ord. 216-78 §4, 1978).  
14.08.360 - Delinquent payments-Lien-Disconnection. 
Any charge or rental levied by the city or pursuant to the provisions of Sections 14.08.270 through 14.08.380 on any premises within the corporate limits of the city having a connection to the city sewer system is a lien upon such premises. The city administrator is authorized, and it shall be his duty, to disconnect any sewer connection on premises located either within the corporate limits of the city or outside the corporate limits of the city upon failure of the person to whom such rental is charged or billed to pay such charge or rental prior to delinquency. 
(Ord. 216-78 §5, 1979).  
14.08.370 - Service disconnection-Procedure. 
A.  A customer's sewer service may be discontinued (shut off) if the total charges on a customer's bill are not paid by forty-five days following the date of presentation. 
B.  When a disconnect notice has been presented to a customer, all outstanding bills, up to and including the current bill, must be paid or all of the utility services will be discontinued as provided in this section. 
C.  All charges for garbage and rubbish service, water service, sewer service and any other service rendered by the city, may be billed upon the same bill and collected along with any ten percent charges as designated in subsection B of Section 4.08.340 and subsection A of this section, as one total item. If all or part of the bill is not paid, any or all of the services for which the bill is rendered may be discontinued. 
(Ord. 216-78 §9, 1978).  
14.08.380 - Service disconnection—Reestablishment. 
When sewer service has been disconnected as provided in Sections 14.08.360 and 14.08.370, the city administrator may require that a sum equal to two years' monthly service charges shall be deposited with the city clerk, in cash (such deposit to be returned after a three-year period of nondelinquent payment of service charges. Any one month delinquent will cause this period to commence again.) In addition, a fifty-dollar connection fee shall be paid before service is resumed. 
(Ord. 216-78 §6, 1978).  
14.08.390 - Fees and charges—Recordation. 
The city clerk shall keep a permanent and accurate account of all fees and charges received under this chapter, giving the names and addresses of the persons on whose account the fees and charges were paid, the date and amount thereof, and the purpose for which charges were paid. 
(Ord. 217-78 §208, 1978).  
14.08.400 - Fees and charges—Estimates. 
Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever the fees and charges required by this chapter are based on estimated values or estimated quantities, the director shall make such determinations in accordance with established estimating practices.

14.08.410 - Fees and charges—Delinquency fee. 
All fees and charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter, except Sections 14.08.250 through 14.08.380 are due and payable upon receipt of the notice of charges. Unpaid charges shall become delinquent twenty days after mailing or delivering the notice of charges. A basic penalty charge of twenty percent of the unpaid amount shall be added to any fee or charge that becomes delinquent. Interest at the rate of one-half percent per month shall accrue on the total of all delinquent charges plus all penalty charges. 
(Ord. 217-78 §211, 1978).  
IV - INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS 
 
14.08.420 - Permit—Requirements. 
A.  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to sewerage facilities owned by the city without first obtaining a city permit for industrial wastewater discharge. 
B.  The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, relocation of point of discharge, prohibition of discharge of certain wastewater components, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased costs of the city created by the wastewater discharge and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. 
C.  No city permit for industrial wastewater discharge is transferable without the prior written consent of the director. 
D.  No person shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by the permit for industrial wastewater discharge. Any person desiring to discharge wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with the industrial wastewater permit shall apply to the city for an amended permit. 
(Ord. 217-78 §401, 1978).  
14.08.430 - Permit—Application—Form and processing. 
A.  Applicants for a permit for industrial wastewater discharge shall complete a city application form. The city may require additional information on the characteristics of the wastewater discharge beyond that required on the application form. 
B.  Upon receipt of all required information, the application shall be processed and, upon approval, be signed by a representative of the city and one copy returned to the applicant. When properly signed, the application form shall constitute a valid permit for industrial wastewater discharge. 
(Ord. 217-78 §402(part), 1978).  
14.08.440 - Permit—Application—Approval. 
The application will be approved if the applicant has complied with all applicable requirements of this chapter and furnished all information requested by the city, and if the director determines that there is adequate capacity in the city's facilities to convey, treat and dispose of the wastewaters. 
(Ord. 217-78 §402(part), 1978).  
14.08.450 - Permit—Change of restrictions, conditions. 
The city may change the restrictions or conditions of a permit for industrial wastewater discharge from time to time as circumstances may require. The city shall allow an industrial discharger a reasonable period of time to comply with any changes in the industrial wastewater permit required by the city. 
(Ord. 217-78 §403, 1978).  
14.08.460 - Permit—Suspension—Process. 
The director may suspend a permit for industrial wastewater discharge for a period of not to exceed forty-five days when such suspension is necessary in order to stop a discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or welfare to the local environment or to the city's sewerage system. 
Any discharger notified of a suspension of his industrial wastewater permit shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of industrial wastewater to the sewerage system. In the event of a failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to insure compliance. 
(Ord. 217-78 §404(part), 1978).  
14.08.470 - Permit—Suspension—Hearing. 
A.  Any suspended discharger may file with the director a request for hearing, in which event the city council shall meet within twenty days of the receipt of the director of such request. The council shall hold a hearing on the suspension and shall either confirm or revoke the action of the director. Reasonable notice of the hearing shall be given to the suspended discharger in the manner provided for in Section 14.08.670. At this hearing the suspended discharger may appear personally or through counsel, cross examine witnesses, and present evidence in his own behalf. 
In the event that the council fails to meet within the time set forth in subsection A or fails to make a determination within a reasonable time after the close of the hearing, the order of suspension shall be stayed until a determination is made either confirming or revoking the action of the director. 
B.  The director shall reinstate the industrial wastewater permit upon proof of satisfactory compliance with the discharge requirements of the city. 
(Ord. 217-78 §404(part), 1978).  
14.08.480 - Permit—Revocation—Procedure. 
A.  The city council may revoke a permit for industrial wastewater discharge upon a finding that the discharger has violated any provisions of this chapter. No revocation shall be ordered until a hearing on the question has been held by the city council. At this hearing, the discharger may appear personally or through counsel, cross examine witnesses and present evidence in his own behalf. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the discharger in accordance with Section 14.-08.670 at least fifteen days prior to the date of hearing. 
B.  Any discharger whose industrial wastewater permit has been revoked shall immediately stop all discharge of any liquid carried wastes covered by the permit to any public sewer that is tributary to a sewer or sewerage system of the city. The director may disconnect or permanently block from such public sewer the industrial connection sewer of any discharger whose permit has been revoked if such action is necessary to insure compliance with the order of revocation. 
(Ord. 217-78 §405(part), 1978).  
14.08.490 - Permit—Revocation—Reapplication. 
Before any further discharge of industrial wastewater may be made by a discharger whose permit has been revoked, he must apply for a new city permit for industrial wastewater discharge, pay all charges that would be required upon initial application, together with all delinquent fees, charges and penalties and such other sums as the discharger may owe to the city. Costs incurred by the city in revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial connection sewer shall be paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new permit for industrial wastewater discharge. 
(Ord. 217-78 §405(part), 1978).  
14.08.500 - Prohibited discharges—Determination. 
In most cases, the concentration or amount of any particular constituent which will be judged to be excessive or unreasonable cannot be foreseen but will depend on the results of technical determinations and the actions of regulatory agencies. The list of constituents which may be regulated provides specific limits only where they are now reasonably well established. The other constituents in the list are presented with the objective of enumerating the types of wastes which will be regulated from time to time. 
(Ord. 217-78 §406(part), 1978).  
14.08.510 - Prohibited discharges—Designated. 
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the city's sewerage system, or to any sewer which directly or indirectly connects to the city's sewerage system, the following wastes:

No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the city's sewerage system, or to any sewer which directly or indirectly connects to the city's sewerage system, any wastes which, in the opinion of the director, may have an adverse or harmful effect on sewers, maintenance personnel, wastewater treatment plant personnel or equipment, treatment plant effluent quality, public or private property, or may otherwise endanger the public, the local environment or create a public nuisance. The director, in determining the acceptability of specific wastes, shall consider the nature of the waste and the adequacy and nature of the collection, treatment and disposal system available to accept the waste. 
(Ord. 217-78 §406(part), 1978). 
(Ord. No. 409-2012, §§ 1, 2, 12-13-2012)  
14.08.515 - Temporary discharge permits. 
The contents of a swimming pool, pond, storage tank, or other container of water, may be drained and discharged into the city's sewerage system only with a temporary permit issued by the city. The temporary permit shall be given only upon a determination by the director of public works that the sewerage system has available the capacity to handle the proposed discharge, and upon such conditions as the director of public works may deem appropriate. The city clerk shall establish the form of the written application for a temporary permit. Fees, if any, for such a temporary permit may be established upon approval by city council resolution. Violation of this section shall be punishable as provided in Section 14.08.720, hereinbelow, and violators shall be liable for any resulting damage to city facilities and private property. The owner and party in possession and control of the real property where the prohibited discharge was made shall be jointly liable for the payment of fines, penalties, and damages imposed by this section. 
(Ord. No. 409-2012, § 3, 12-13-2012)  
14.08.520 - Availability of city's facilities. 
If sewerage capacity is not available, the city may require the industrial wastewater discharger to restrict his discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available. The city may refuse service to persons locating facilities in areas where their proposed quantity or quality of industrial wastewater is unacceptable in the available treatment facility. 
(Ord. 217-78 §407, 1978).  
14.08.530 - Pretreatment. 
An industrial wastewater pretreatment system or device may be required by the director when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge to the sewer of certain waste constituents, to distribute more equally over a longer time period any peak discharges of industrial wastewaters, or to accomplish any specific pretreatment result. All pretreatment systems or devices shall be subject to the approval of the director prior to installation, but such approval shall not absolve the industrial discharger of the responsibility of meeting any industrial effluent limitation required by the city. In special cases, the director may require construction of sewer lines by the discharger to convey certain industrial wastes to a specific trunk sewer. All pretreatment systems judged by the director to require engineering design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed by the state. 
Normally, a gravity separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber and control manhole will be required respectively to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and quality, or quantity or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flows and to facilitate inspection, flow measurement and sampling. Floor drains from commercial or manufacturing buildings, warehouses or multi-use structures shall not discharge directly to the sewer, but shall first discharge to a gravity separation interceptor. 
(Ord. 217-78 §408, 1978).  
14.08.540 - Separation of wastewaters—Control manholes. 
A.  All domestic or sanitary wastewaters from toilets, lavatories, restrooms, showers, drinking fountains and like facilities shall be kept separate from all industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment system or device. 
B.  A control manhole of a design approved by the director shall be furnished and installed by certain designated industrial wastewater dischargers to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow measurements by personnel of the city. This control manhole shall be located off the industrial premises or, if within the plant fence, the manhole shall be accessible to authorized personnel of the city at all times. The control manhole may be used as a junction manhole for domestic sewerage and industrial wastes; provided the junction occurs downstream of the sampling or flow measuring point. 
(Ord. 217-78 §409, 1978).  
14.08.550 - Sampling, analysis, flow measurements. 
A.  Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, COD and suspended solids for use in determining the amount of the industrial wastewater treatment surcharge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary by the director shall be made by all industrial wastewater dischargers, unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the director. All sampling, analysis and flow measurements of industrial wastewaters shall be performed by a state certified independent laboratory, by a laboratory of an industrial discharger approved by the director, or by personnel of the city. If performed by city personnel, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the discharger requesting the test. Prior to submittal to the city of data developed in the laboratory of an industrial discharger, the results shall be verified by a responsible administrative official of the industrial discharger under penalty of perjury. 
B.  All wastewater analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedure contained in "Standard Methods." If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the industry of a procedure judged satisfactory by the director shall be used to measure wastewater constituents. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing tests shall furnish any required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used, if requested to do so by the director. 
C.  All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at the control manhole or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter or similar device approved by the director and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the director. 
D.  The sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedure, equipment and results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the city. Sampling and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to authorized personnel. 
E.  Those industrial wastewater dischargers required by the director to make periodic measurements of industrial wastewater flows and constituents shall annually make the minimum number of such measurements required. The minimum requirement for such periodic measurements shall be at least one twenty-four-hour measurement per year, the date of such measurement to be selected by the director. Representative samples of the industrial wastewater shall be obtained at least once per hour over the twenty-four-hour period, properly refrigerated, composited according to measured flow rates during the twenty-four hours and analyzed for the specified wastewater constituents. Industrial plants with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analysis for every working day. When required by the director, dischargers shall install and maintain in proper order automatic flow-proportional sampling equipment and automatic analysis and recording equipment, or any one or more of them. 
F.  Measurements to verify the quantities of waste flows and waste constituents reported by industrial dischargers will be conducted on a random basis by personnel of the city. 
(Ord. 217-78 §410, 1978).  
14.08.560 - Discrepancies between actual and reported industrial wastewater discharge quantities. 
A.  Should measurements or other investigations reveal that the industrial discharger is discharging a flow rate, or a quantity of flow, BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or suspended solids significantly in excess of that stated on the industrial wastewater permit or in excess of the quantities reported to the city by the discharger and upon which the industrial wastewater treatment surcharge is based, the discharger shall apply for an amended industrial wastewater permit and shall be assessed for all delinquent charges together with the penalty and interest provided for in Section 14.08.640. Before these charges shall be assessed, at least two additional twenty-four-hour samples and flow measurements shall be obtained by the city with all costs of sampling and analysis to be paid by the discharger. 
B.  For the purpose of establishing the correct treatment surcharge, the data obtained in these samplings, along with any other relevant information obtained by the city or presented by the discharger, shall be used by the director in determining the surcharge formula. An industrial discharger found in violation shall, in the absence of other evidence, be presumed to have been discharging at the determined parameter values over the preceding three years or subsequent to the previous city verification of quantity parameters, whichever period is shorter. 
(Ord. 217-78 §411, 1978).  
14.08.570 - Industry classification. 
The director may classify dischargers and establish an industrial wastewater treatment surcharge based upon average flow quality and flow quantity for the industrial category adjusted by some commonly recognized parameter selected by the director that establishes the relative size of the industrial discharger being charged. 
(Ord. 217-78 §412, 1978).  
14.08.580 - Damage caused by prohibited wastewater discharge. 
Any industrial wastewater discharger who discharges or causes the discharge of prohibited wastewaters which cause damage to city's facilities, detrimental effects on treatment processes or any other damages resulting in costs to the city shall be liable to the city for damage occasioned thereby. 
(Ord. 217-78 §413, 1978).  
V - TRUCKER'S DISCHARGE PERMIT 
 
14.08.590 - Required. 
All persons owning vacuum or cesspool pump trucks or other liquid waste transport trucks and desiring to discharge septic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents, industrial liquid wastes or other liquid wastes to sewerage facilities of the city or to facilities that discharge directly or indirectly to such sewerage facilities shall first have a valid city's trucker's discharge permit. All applicants for a trucker's discharge permit shall complete the application form, pay the appropriate fee, receive a copy of the city's regulations governing discharge to sewers of liquid wastes from trucks and shall agree, in writing, to abide by these regulations. 
(Ord. 217-78 §414(part), 1978).  
14.08.600 - Validity. 
The trucker's discharge permit shall be valid for one year from date of issuance. 
(Ord. 217-78 §414(part), 1978).  
14.08.610 - Discharge locations. 
Discharge of septic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents or other wastes containing no industrial wastes may be made by trucks holding a city permit at any of the city's designated public dumping manholes. Truck transported industrial wastes shall be discharged only at the locations and during the time periods specified by the director for the specific waste. The city may require payment for treatment and disposal costs or may refuse permission to discharge certain prohibited wastes. 
(Ord. 217-78 §414(part), 1978).  
14.08.620 - Revocation. 
Any person negligently or wilfully violating the city's requirements for liquid waste discharges from trucks shall be in violation of this chapter and may have his permit revoked by the director. 
(Ord. 217-78 §414(part), 1978).  
VI - VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS 
 
14.08.630 - Trade secrets. 
In respect to the trade secrets, it is determined that the public interest served by not making said records public clearly outweights the public interest served by the disclosure of said records. Accordingly, any trade secrets acquired by the city in the course of implementation or enforcement of this chapter shall not be made public except to the extent necessary to enforce this chapter. 
(Ord. 217-78 §415, 1978).

Chapter 16.20 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT* 
Sections:  
I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 
 
16.20.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of city of Weed are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway". 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 16.20.500 et seq., of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" means the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Section 16.20.500 et seq., of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system that consists of a levee or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet flood-proofing standard in subsection 16.20.400(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in subsection 16.20.400(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in subsection 16.20.400(B); and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 16.20.410. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" is determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation that has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
"New construction" for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
"Obstruction" means and includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 16.20.500 et seq., of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake or river, bay, stream, canal or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis; is four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
Sheet flow area. See "Area of shallow flooding". 
"Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99 or AH. 
"Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
16.20.200 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Weed. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.210 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated July 20, 1981 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated January 20, 1982, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 550 Main Street, Weed, California. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.220 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the term of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor.

Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.260 - Severability. 
This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
IV. - ADMINISTRATION 
 
16.20.300 - Establishment of development permit. 
A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 16.20.210. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
A.  Site plan, including but not limited to: 
1.  For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and twenty-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one foot contour elevations throughout the building site; 
2.  Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer and utilities; 
3.  If available, the base flood elevation from the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map; and 
4.  If applicable, the location of the regulatory floodway. 
B.  Foundation design detail, including but not limited to: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
2.  For a crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in subsection 16.20.400(C)(3) of this chapter and FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93; and 
3.  For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill, and compaction requirements (compacted to ninety-five percent using the Standard Proctor Test method). 
C.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be flood proofed, as required in subsection 16.20.400(C)(2) of this chapter and FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93;

E.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.310 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city administrator or his or her designated representative is appointed to administer, implement and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.320 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
B.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. 
1.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 16.20.210, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 16.20.400 et seq. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption; or 
2.  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas—A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (one hundred-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 16.20.400 et seq: 
a.  Simplified method. 
i.  One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge drainage area method, and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA. 
b.  Detailed method. The one hundred-year or base flood discharge and the base flood elevation shall be obtained using detailed methods identified in FEMA Publication 265, published in July 1995 and titled: "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas—A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (one hundred-year) Flood Elevations". 
C.  Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
2.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse is maintained. 
D.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available, as needed, the following: 
1.  Certification required by subsection 16.20.400(C)(1) and Section 16.20.430 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by subsection 16.20.400(C)(2) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by subsection 16.20.400(C)(3) (wet flood proofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by subsection 16.20.420(B) (subdivision standards); 
5.  Certification required by subsection 16.20.450(A) (floodway encroachments). 
E.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 16.20.500 et seq. 
F.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 16.20.220. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.330 - Appeals. 
The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
V. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
 
16.20.400 - Standards of construction. 
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
A.  Anchoring. 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
2.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 16.20.430. 
B.  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
1.  With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 2-93, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
2.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
3.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and 
4.  Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
C.  Elevation and Floodproofing. (See Section 16.20.100 definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement".) 
1.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement; 
a.  In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified, 
b.  In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in subsection 16.20.320(B) of this chapter, 
c.  In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
2.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with subsection (C)(1) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
a.  Be flood proofed below the elevation recommended under subsection (C)(1) of this section so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy, and 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above-grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater, or 
b.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
4.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 16.20.430. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.410 - Standards for utilities. 
A.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.420 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
B.  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
C.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
D.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
E.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.430 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, AE, V1-30, V and VE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection A of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation (the state of California recommends at least two feet above the base flood elevation); or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above-grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.440 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use—a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
2.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 16.20.300 et seq. of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection 16.20.430(A). 
B.  Recreation vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V and VE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will meet the requirements of subsection A of this section. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.450 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 16.20.210 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 16.20.400 et seq. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
VI. - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 
 
16.20.500 - Nature of variances. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level, are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.510 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
C.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).  
16.20.520 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 16.20.300 and 16.20.400 et seq. of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 16.20.100 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 16.20.100 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 16.20.100 - see "Public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 16.20.100) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or chapters. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (A) through (E) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 16.20.510(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. 366-2003 §1(part), 2004).

17.12.310 - Variance. 
A.  Variances Based On Hardship. It is realized that there are certain parcels of land of such dimension, subject to such title restrictions, so affected by physical conditions and/or devoted to such use that it is impossible for the subdivider to conform to all of the rules of this chapter when subdividing property. 
The planning commission may recommend to the city council the granting of a variance from the requirements of this chapter when all of the following conditions are found to apply: 
1.  That any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same vicinity; 
2.  That, because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict literal application of this title is found to deprive subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity; 
3.  That, under the circumstances of this particular case, the variance, rather than the sections at issue in this title, actually carries out the spirit and intent of this title. 
B.  Exception Based on Improved Design. The standards required by this chapter may be varied when gross density of an area remains the same, and where, in the opinion of the planning commission (or on appeal the city council), said exception will: 
1.  Reduce the area and unsightliness of cut and fill banks; 
2.  Reduce the danger of erosion; 
3.  Create better community environment through dedication of public areas, rearrangement of lot sizes, reforestation of barren areas; 
4.  Use other techniques which will produce a more desirable and liveable community than the minimum requirements in this chapter. 
As an incentive to creating better overall communities the planning commission may recommend exceptions of up to twenty percent reduction in lot size but with no increase in density in the overall development. Said planning commission may authorize similar deviations from other standards of this chapter where said deviations are for the purposes outlined above. 
Before any variance based on improved design is recommended it shall be passed by not less than a two-thirds vote of the total membership of the planning commission, upon a finding that the variance, as recommended, will result in a community which is a substantial improvement over the community which could have been developed by following the actual requirements of this chapter.

Chapter 17.32 - LAND DEDICATIONS/PAYMENT OF FEES 
Sections: 
 
17.32.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to California Government Code Section 66477, and the general police power of the city. The park and recreation facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this chapter are consistent with the recreation element of the Weed General Plan. 
(Ord. 304-93 §1(part), 1993).  
17.32.020 - Requirement. 
At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the approving body shall determine the land required for dedication or amount of in-lieu fee pursuant to Sections 17.32.050 and 17.32.060. As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, at the option of the city, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. 304-93 §1(part), 1993).  
17.32.030 - Determination of land or fee. 
Whether the approving body of the city accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
A.  The compatibility of dedication with the general plan of the city; 
B.  The natural features, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
C.  The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
D.  The feasibility of dedication; 
E.  The location of existing and proposed park sites and trail ways; 
F.  The then-current availability of resources to properly develop and maintain a dedication. 
(Ord. 304-93 §1(part), 1993).  
17.32.040 - General standard. 
The city council finds that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five acres of land for each one thousand persons residing within this city be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreational purposes in accordance with the open space recreational element of the General Plan of the city. 
(Ord. 304-93 §1(part), 1993).  
17.32.050 - Formula for dedication of land. 
A.  The city council finds, based on historical experience and current statistical trends, that the average occupancy of a single-family dwelling is 2.44 persons, that for a duplex or triplex dwelling is 2.07 persons and that for an apartment unit is 1.79 persons. 
B.  The formula for the minimum area of land to be dedicated under this chapter is thus: 
(DUs x Persons per Unit) x Gen. Std. = Dedication 
Where: 
"DUs" = Number of new dwelling units within the subdivision; 
"Persons per Unit" = Statistical average occupancy under subsection A of this section; 
"Gen. Std." = General Standard of park land required per person under Section 17.32.040; 
"Min. Acre. Dedication" = The minimum area of land to be dedicated by the property owner to the city of Weed under this chapter. 
(Ord. 304-93 §1(part), 1993).  
17.32.060 - Fee in lieu of land. 
If the city opts to accept a cash payment in lieu of a dedication of land, the subdivider shall pay a fee in an amount calculated as follows: 
Min. Acre. Dedication x FMV per Acre = Amount of Cash Payment 
Where: 
"Min. Acre. Dedication" = The minimum area of land to be dedicated under this chapter, as calculated under Section 17.32.050; 
"FMV per Acre" = Fair market value of an acre of buildable park land, as determined according to Section 17.32.070, plus twenty percent of that amount for minimum improvement costs.

Chapter 18.20 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 
Sections: 
 
18.20.010 - Purpose. 
Planned unit developments, involving the careful application of design, are encouraged to achieve a more functional, aesthetical pleasing and harmonious living and working environment within the city which otherwise might not be possible by strict adherence to the regulations of this title. The planned unit development district is designed to accommodate various types of developments, such as neighborhood and district shopping centers, professional and administrative areas, multiple housing developments, single-family housing developments, commercial service centers and industrial parks, or any other use or combination of uses which can be made appropriately a part of a planned unit development. The planned unit development district is intended to enable and encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such manner as to promote its most appropriate use; to allow diversification in the relationship of various uses, structures and spaces; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space and offer recreational opportunities close to home; to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural green spaces; and to counteract the effects of urban congestion and monotony. 
The proposed development shall be designed to produce an environment of a stable and desirable character and shall provide standards of open space and permanently reserved areas for off-street parking adequate for the occupancy proposed, and at least equivalent to those required elsewhere by the provisions of this title for such use. In case of residential development, it shall include provisions for recreation areas to meet the needs of the anticipated population. 
Any land use permitted by this title may be considered as a use within the planned unit development district. 
(Ord. 148—76 (part), 1976: Ord. 45—63 §4.32(1), 1963).  
18.20.020 - Located in any district. 
A planned unit development may be located in any district upon the amendment of Ordinance 45—63 to provide for redistricting as a planned unit development district, otherwise designated as a PD district.

18.20.030 - Permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses. 
Any land use permitted by this title may be considered as a use within a planned unit development (PUD) district provided such use is shown on the development plan. A use permit is required for each subsequent use or groups of uses within a multi-use planned unit development. A use permit is not required for a single use planned unit development. A "single use" is defined as a use or group of uses intended as the primary use of the parcel. Uses subordinate to the identified primary use are subject to a use permit.  
18.20.040 - Minimum site area. 
The minimum site area for a planned unit development shall be determined by the minimum conventional zoning site area for the types of uses proposed within the development.

18.20.050 - Standards. 
The standards of site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, distances between structures, off-street parking and off—street loading facilities and landscaped areas need not be equivalent to the standards prescribed for the regulations for other districts which involve similar uses if the applicant has demonstrated, by his design proposal, that the objectives of this title will be achieved. 
The average population density per net acre may not exceed the maximum population density prescribed by the site area regulations or the site area per dwelling regulations of other comparable districts, unless the applicant can demonstrate, by his design proposal and such additional evidence as may be submitted, that the objectives of this title will be achieved. Since planned unit developments may also involve the subdivision process, the applicant must be prepared to show what changes in conventional street and lot design will be necessary to achieve the desired goals. 
(Ord. 148-76 (part), 1976: Ord. 45-63 §4.32(5), 1963).

C.  When a planned unit development involves proposals which necessitate the filing of a tentative subdivision map and which would also necessitate the granting of exceptions of the regulations of the subdivision ordinance, the city council, on the recommendation of the planning commission, may grant tentative approval of the proposal. Where such tentative approval is requested by the applicant, the requirements of subsections A and B of this section may be waived temporarily, provided the applicant submits the following:

D.  The planning commission may issue a report recommending a planned unit development as the application for such planned unit was applied for or in modified form if, on the basis of the application and the evidence submitted, the commission makes the following findings: 
1.  That the proposed location of the planned unit development is in accordance with the objections of this title; 
2.  That the proposed location of the planned unit development and the conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity; 
3.  That the proposed planned unit development will comply with each of the applicable provisions of this section; 
4.  That the standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, heights of structures, distance between structures, off-street parking and off-street loading facilities and landscaped areas will produce an environment of stable and desirable character consistent with the objectives of this title; 
5.  That the standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, height of structures, distances between structures and off-street parking and off-street loading facilities will be such that the development will not generate more traffic that the streets in the vicinity can carry without congestion and will not overload utilities; 
6.  That the combination of different dwelling types and variety of land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity; 
7.  The proposed planned unit development or the first use or group of uses can be substantially completed with two years after the district is established. 
E.  At the first regular city council meeting held more than ten days after a decision on such an application by the planning commission, the city council shall review the decision. The city council may affirm, reverse or modify a decision of the planning commission on an application for a planned unit development, provided that, if a decision denying such an application is reversed or a report covering a planned unit development is modified, the city council, on the basis of the record transmitted by the planning commission and such additional evidence as may be submitted, shall make the findings prerequisite to the approval of an application for a planned unit development as prescribed in subsection D of this section.

3.  That no improvement or modification of the building shall be made without issuance of a building permit by the city. 
   The city council has the right to terminate the continued use of the accessory dwelling unit if, after a public hearing on the matter, it determines that a violation of any zoning, building, fire or other health and safety code of the city exists.

4.  The certificate of registration shall be signed and acknowledged by the owner(s) of record. 
5.  The certificate of registration may be conveyed with title to the property; however this in no way relieves any property owner or successor from compliance with all the terms of the ordinance codified in this chapter and all other applicable regulations. 
6.  Failure to comply with the requirement of this or any other section of this title will comprise a violation that, in addition to penalties cited in Section 1.20.010 of this code, can result in the revocation of the certificate of registration by the city council after public hearing on the matter.
