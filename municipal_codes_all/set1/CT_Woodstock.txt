of this ordinance shall not effect the validity of any other part which can be given effect without such

SECTION 8. PROCEDURE FOR CITATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF
INLAND WETLANDS REGULATIONS.
(a) At any time within twelve months of issuing a citation of violation to a person who has
violated the Regulations, upon authorization from the Inland Wetlands Agency, the
Inland Wetlands Enforcement Officer or his designee (the "Officer") shall send notice
to the person cited informing the person: (1) of fees or fines due; (2) that he or she may
contest his liability before a citation hearing officer by delivering in person or by mail
written notice within ten days of the date of the notice; (3) that if he or she does not
demand a hearing, an assessment and judgement shall be entered against him or her;
and (4) that such judgment may issue without further notice.
(b) If the person who is sent notice pursuant to Subsection 2(a) wishes to admit liability for
any alleged violation, he may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the
22
fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to the Officer. Such
payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the
conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does
not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten days of the date of the first
notice provided shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the Officer shall certify
such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall
thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by the
applicable ordinances and shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection (d) of this
section.
(c) Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and
place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days nor more
than thirty days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall
grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for
postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial notice of
violation issued by the Officer shall be filed and retained by the Town, and shall be
deemed to be a business record within the scope of section 52-180 of the Connecticut
General Statutes and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the
Officer or policeman shall be required at the hearing if the person cited so requests. A
person wishing to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing and may present
evidence in his behalf. A designated municipal official, other than the hearing officer,
may present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If the person cited fails to appear,
the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of
proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the hearing officer may accept from the person cited copies of police
reports, investigatory and citation reports,and other official documents by mail and may
determine thereby that the appearance of the person cited is unnecessary. The hearing
officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof
as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall
not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The
hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines
that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in
writing accordingly. If he determines that the person is liable for the violation, he shall
forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person either in
the amount originally assessed by the Inland Wetlands Agency or in such other amount,
not to exceed $1,000, as the hearing officer deems appropriate.
(d) If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by
first class mail a notice of assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less
than thirty days nor more than twelve months after such mailing, a certified copy of the
notice of assessment with the clerk of the superior court for the Geographical Area of
Windham together with an entry fee of eight dollars. The certified copy of the notice of
assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period,
assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one record of
assessment and court costs of eight dollars, against such person in favor of the Town.
23
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Connecticut General Statues, the hearing
officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment shall have the effect of a civil
money judgement and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further
notice of such person.
(e) A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is
entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted with thirty
days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen
assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small
claims case pursuant to section 52-259 of the Connecticut General Statues, in the
superior court for the Geographical Area of Windham, which shall entitle such person
to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the superior court.
(f) The First Selectman shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers, to serve at the
pleasure of the First Selectman, to conduct hearings under this Ordinance; such hearing
officers shall not be police officers or employees of the Town or persons who issue
citations under this Ordinance.

The Legislature of the state of Connecticut has in Section 7-148(c)(7) of the General
Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town Meeting of
the Town of Woodstock, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:
1.2 FINDING THE FACT
1.2.1 The flood hazard areas of the Town of Woodstock are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairments of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
1.2.2 These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard area by uses
vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
1.3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
27
1.3.1 Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities:
1.3.2 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
1.3.3 Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
1.3.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or
flood damage, and;
1.3.5 Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which may increase flood hazard
to other lands.
1.4 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this ordinance are:
1.4.1 to protect human life and health;
1.4.2 to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects;
1.4.3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
1.4.4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions;
1.4.5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;
1.4.6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
flood prone areas in such manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and;
1.4.7 to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a home, a gas or liquid
storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures.
"Substantial Improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or
improvements to a structure, taking place during the life of a structure in which the cumulative cost
equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure
should be (1) appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or
(2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of
this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.
"Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a
manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship.
"Water Surface Elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in
the flood plains of coastal or river line areas.

AND/OR FLOODING
Obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
Federal, State or other source, including data developed pursuant to Section 4.3.1(k) of this ordinance,
as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone
A on the Community's FIRM meet the standards in Section 5.3, and Section 6.
5.2.1 In A Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway
is designated, require that no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any
point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the
proposed development.
5.2.2 Should data be requested and/or provided, adopt a regulatory floodway based on the
principal that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the
water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse.
5.3 SPECIFIC STANDARDS
5.3.1 In all areas of special flood hazard A1-30, where base flood elevation data has been
provided, as set forth in 3.2 or 4.3.1(k), the following provisions are required:
(a) Residential Construction: New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at
least to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.

5.3.3 FLOODWAYS
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways on the
community's Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or as may have been determined in Section 4.3.1.(k).
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
38
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer
is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00) increase in flood levels
during occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its consents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(e) The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent facility;
(f) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage for
the proposed use;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
40
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters, and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site, and;
(k) The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges.

Woodstock Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency shall attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
7.5.3 Conditions for Variances
(a) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical
building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic
character and design of the building.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. a showing of good and sufficient cause,
2. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship,
and
3. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on a
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25.00 for
$100.00 of insurance coverage.
(d) The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

sections 7-147a through 7-147k, inclusive as amended, to provide guidance to property owners as to
factors to be considered in preparing an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness. Such

interest and distinctiveness of this community. The purpose of regulations should be to uphold the
general spirit of preserving the character of a district, but the Commission will in its deliberations

and agricultural activities. Specifically, in the interests of promoting the welfare of the town, the

or remaining bond released until such costs have been paid.

consultative assistance in reviewing and evaluating matters directly related to applications for land
development projects if the Commission determines that the nature, intensity, scope or impact of

that the actual costs of processing such municipal land use applications exceeds the established
minimum fees. The requested assistance shall directly pertain to the statutory jurisdiction of the
Commission. The requested supplemental fees shall be limited to the documented actual costs of

applicant exceed 110% of the approved fee.

have been completed, the Commission may, in its discretion, and subject to any contrary
provisions of state law, use the funds available in the Bond(s) on file, to complete
improvements as deemed required by the Commission or restore all or any portion of the
site to an acceptable and stable condition.

H. Stormwater Pollution, Soil Erosion & Sediment Control
In order to protect the water quality and properties surrounding development sites, it is important to
Town of Woodstock Zoning Regulations, Article VI
108
control Stormwater pollution, erosion and sedimentation on sites under construction and afterwards
when the site has been put to the approved use.
1. Purpose
a. The following are the Town objectives for stormwater runoff, erosion and sediment
control:
i. Prevent flooding of onsite and offsite property
ii. Recharge Inland Wetlands, surface and subsurface waters
iii. Minimize pollutant loads in stormwater runoff into Inland Wetlands, surface and
subsurface waters
iv. Utilize the least intrusive and most natural methods of handling stormwater and other
typical waterflow
v. Maximize the use of Low Impact Development (LID) and the most effective
stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs)
b. A single family dwelling that is not part of a subdivision of land shall be exempt from this
portion of the Regulations.
H. 2. Standards for Stormwater Runoff, Erosion & Sediment Control
The proposed development shall be designed so as to meet the following standards:
a. Preserve pre-development site hydrology (i.e., runoff, infiltration, interception, evapotranspiration,
groundwater recharge, and stream baseflow);
b. Preserve and protect wetlands, stream buffers, natural drainage systems and other
natural features that provide water quality/quantity benefits;
c. Manage runoff velocity and volume in a manner that has minimal impact on the physical
and biological character of existing drainage systems and prevents increases in
downstream flooding/streambank erosion;
d. Prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters and wetlands in amounts that exceed
the systems’ natural ability to assimilate the pollutants and provide the desired functions;
and,
e. Seek multi-objective benefits (i.e., flood control, water quality, recreation, aesthetics,
habitat) from stormwater control measures.
f. After construction has been completed and the site is permanently stabilized, reduce the
average annual total suspended solids loadings by eighty (80) percent. For high-quality
Town of Woodstock Zoning Regulations, Article VI
109
receiving waters and sites with the highest potential for significant pollutant loadings,
reduce post-development pollutant loadings so that average annual post-development
loadings do not exceed pre-development loadings (i.e.: no net increase, as the term is
defined in 2004 The Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual as may be amended).
g. The first design priority is to use LID methods for managing stormwater and minimizing
the impact of pollutants, whether direct or indirect, on the surrounding environment.
Preference will be given to methods that mimic natural drainage patterns. Where LID
methods cannot be utilized, consideration will be given for more traditional stormwater
treatment practices.
h. To minimize erosion and sedimentation the proposed development shall comply with the
standards as detailed in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment
Control, as may be amended. The following criteria shall be met:
i. Any proposed development shall conform as closely as possible to the existing
topography, while minimizing the area of disturbance so as to create the least
erosion potential.
ii. To the greatest extent possible, existing vegetation shall be retained and protected,
including the root zones around trees that are to be saved.
iii. The permanent stabilization of the site shall be implemented during the planting
seasons of April 1st through June 15th and August 15th through October 1st or a
landscaping bond shall be required. The landscaping bond may be released upon
completing the permanent stabilization of the site as confirmed by an inspection by
the ZEO.
iv. Proposed development shall be designed using Best Management Practices to
effectively accommodate the increased runoff caused by the development during and
after construction. Computations for runoff shall be in accordance with 2004 CT
Stormwater Quality Manual as amended.
H. 3. Stormwater Runoff, Erosion & Sediment Control Plan
A Stormwater Pollution, Erosion & Sediment Control Plan is required for all site development
and construction, including but not limited to subdivisions, resubdivisions, Village Green
Districts and Special Permitted uses when the disturbed area of such development is more
than one-half acre.
a. Plan Requirements
The Stormwater Runoff, Erosion & Sediment Control Plan shall be prepared in
accordance with BMPs as detailed in both the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality
Manual and the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, as
each may be amended.

110
H. 4. Certification Procedure
Per Connecticut General Statute, Sec. 22a-329, the Commission or its designee, on behalf
of the municipality, shall certify that the E&S portion of the Plan complies with the
requirements of this Regulation before an application can be approved. If the E&S portion
of the Plan is not certified then the entire application shall be denied.
a. To be eligible for certification, it shall contain BMPs or proper provisions to adequately
control erosion and sedimentation and reduce the danger from storm water runoff on the
proposed site and does not allow for erosion or sedimentation based on the best available
technology.
i. The BMPs regarding erosion and sediment control are described in the 2002
Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as may be amended.
ii. Alternative principles, methods and practices may be used with prior approval of the
Commission and/or staff.
b. Upon receipt of the complete Plan, the ZEO shall review for compliance with these
Regulations.
i. Any Plan submitted may also be reviewed by the Eastern Connecticut Conservation
District and/or by the Woodstock Town Engineer at the discretion of the ZEO.
ii. Additional control measures shall be incorporated into the Plan as required by the
ZEO, Conservation District, or the Town Engineer.
iii. If the E&S portion of the Plan is acceptable to the ZEO, it will be indicated as
certified.
H. 5. Construction Phase
The stormwater pollution, erosion and sediment control methods approved as part of the
development shall be maintained and repaired when necessary throughout the construction phase
to ensure the site is stable and the implementation of the project does not adversely affect the
project site and adjacent properties in terms of drainage, erosion and sedimentation.
a. If an Erosion and Sediment Control Bond was required when approved, it shall be
submitted in the amount stated in the approval prior to construction or when the mylar is
filed.
b. An E&S Bond shall be separate from any other bonds for the development.
c. If additional temporary vegetation, mulching, or other stabilization methods as defined in
Town of Woodstock Zoning Regulations, Article VI
111
the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment Control, as may be amended,
shall be used to prevent erosion during construction, where deemed necessary by the
ZEO, the Town Engineer or the Eastern Connecticut Soil and Water Conservation District.
d. After installation of the E&S controls and during site development and construction, the
contractor must schedule an inspection with the ZEO who will inspect the site to determine
that all necessary erosion and sediment controls have been properly installed in
accordance with the Plan.
e. The ZEO may require modifications to the approved Plan at any time during site
development and construction, should circumstances or site conditions require changes to
meet stabilization requirements of these Regulations.
H. 6. Compliance

conformance with the approved E&S portion of the Plan, the property owner and applicant
will be so notified in writing.
b. In the event of extreme weather and/or failure of the E&S Controls, the ZEO will contact
the responsible parties to address mitigation of the problems as soon as possible.
c. If the problem is not rectified within the timeframe determined by the ZEO, the ZEO may
take steps to correct the problem as necessary using funds to be recovered from the
posted bond.
d. The Applicant and Developer shall ensure that stormwater runoff, erosion and
sedimentation control measures, structures and practices are fully constructed,
implemented and maintained during and after development in accordance with the
approved Plan.
e. The Commission shall assess the costs of such action against the homeowners
association or against the owners of lots within a subdivision or re-subdivision if the
responsible party fails to conduct any necessary inspection, upkeep or repair action, the
Town or its designee shall have the authority to accomplish such inspection, upkeep or
repair.
f. All improvements, structures or facilities designed or intended for stormwater treatment
shall be accessible for inspection. Where such improvements, structures or facilities are
not located on public land/ within a public right-of-way, an easement shall be granted in
favor of the Town for inspection, upkeep and repair thereof.
g. In the case of a Subdivision or Re-Subdivision, the Commission may require that
inspection, upkeep and repair be the responsibility of a homeowners association.
Town of Woodstock Zoning Regulations, Article VI
112
H. 7. Waiver

Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter I
1
CHAPTER I – GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1. Authority and Purpose
These Regulations have been adopted by the Woodstock Planning and Zoning Commission
pursuant to the authority granted in Chapter 126 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut.
It is declared to be the policy of the Commission that as the subdivision of land is a major
determinant of the future physical form of the Town, it should be carried out in a responsible
manner in order to protect the public health and safety of its citizens, as well as the environment,
natural resources, and character of the Town, and to further the goals of the Woodstock Plan of
Conservation and Development. Accordingly, it is the purpose of these Regulations to insure that
land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without
danger to health or the public safety; that proper provision is made for water supply, surface
drainage and sanitary sewerage; that proper provision is made for protective flood control
measures; that roads are arranged to provide safe intersection and are adequate for prospective
traffic needs and provide access for emergency services; that open spaces for conservation, parks
and playgrounds are provided; that provisions are made for soil erosion and sediment control; and
that provisions are made for energy-efficient patterns of development and land use.
These regulations of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be known as the “Subdivision
Regulations of the Town of Woodstock, Connecticut,” which herein are called the “Regulations.”
Section 2. Public and Private Provisions
A. These Regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance,
regulation, or other provision of law, or any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or
legal relationship, and is not the purpose of these Regulations to intercede in, resolve, or
arbitrate any private civil dispute. When these Regulations impose restrictions different from
those imposed by any other statute, ordinance, or other requirement imposed by any level of
government, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
govern.
B. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any legally valid easement, covenant, or any
other private agreement or restriction, provided that where the provisions of these regulations
are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant,
or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or restriction imposes
duties and obligations more restrictive or standards that are higher than the requirements of
these regulations, or the determinations of the Planning & Zoning Commission in approving a
subdivision or in enforcing these regulations or the determinations made under these
regulations, then the private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations
and the determinations made under the regulations.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter II

Section 3. Enforcement, Violations, & Penalties
Upon the adoption of these Regulations, no person shall transfer, sell, lease, or agree to sell land,
nor shall building permits be issued in a proposed subdivision until a plan for such subdivision has
been approved by the Commission in accordance with these Regulations. All plans for the
subdivision or resubdivision of land must be submitted to the Commission for approval. No lot
resulting from the subdivision or resubdivision of any tract or parcel of land shall be sold or offered
for sale or used for building development and no Certificate of Zoning Compliance (Zoning
Permit) for any use, nor any building permit for the erection or enlargement of any building on
such lot, shall be granted without the prior approval of the subdivision or resubdivision plan, or
any amendment thereof, by the Commission, and the filing of the endorsed Final Approved Plan
in the Office of the Town Clerk.
A. No Application of subdivision or resubdivision shall be approved by the Commission unless it
shall conform to the Woodstock Zoning and Subdivision Regulations, shall be in harmony with
the Woodstock Plan of Conservation and Development, and shall demonstrate compatibility with
the Woodstock Plan of Open Space and Conservation.
B. These Regulations shall be enforced by the Woodstock Planning and Zoning Commission or
its designee, whose members are charged with the duty of preventing illegal subdivisions and
securing compliance with requirements imposed by the Commission in granting subdivision
approvals. In accordance with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25, any person, firm,

Town of Woodstock.
Section 8. Amendments
These Regulations may be amended by the Commission in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Section 9. Waivers
The Commission recognizes that each parcel of property is unique in location, dimensions,
orientation, topography, etc., and the various factors in the design of subdivisions are variable with
relation to each other and to the above characteristics of the property. Therefore, in accordance
with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-26, the Commission may in its discretion modify or
waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such requirements as, in its judgment of the special
circumstances and conditions, are not requisite to the interest of public health, safety and general
welfare, provided, however, that no such waiver shall be granted that would significantly lessen
the goals and objectives of Chapters V and VI of these Regulations. In considering a modification
or waiver of these Regulations, the Commission may only approve such modification or waiver
upon a finding that all of the following conditions are met:
A. Conditions exist on the subject property which are not generally applicable to other land in the
Town;
B. Said conditions were not created by the property owner nor by his/her predecessor(s) in title,
including the first legal split of the property;
C. The granting of the modification or waiver would be in harmony with the purpose and intent
of these Regulations and the Woodstock Plan of Conservation and Development; and,
D. The granting of the modification or waiver would not have a significant adverse impact on
adjacent properties’ values, or the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be in
conflict of the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, as the same
may be amended from time to time.
E. The modification or waiver would not allow an increased number of lots to be created than
otherwise allowed by these Regulations and the Woodstock Zoning Regulations.
The Commission may request and consider the recommendations of the Town Planner and
Legal Counsel before approving any modification or waiver of these Regulations.
No modification or waiver of these Regulations shall be approved by the Commission for any
subdivision for which a public hearing has not been held pursuant to these Regulations.
Any request for modification or waiver under this Chapter shall be set forth in writing in the
Application, and, if granted, shall be noted on the Final Approved Plan with a reference to the
lot(s) affected, and the Section of these Regulations modified or waived, and the extent or
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter II
4
nature thereof. In granting or denying any request under this Chapter, the Commission shall
state upon the record the reasons for such action.
In addition to the above requirements, any waiver granted under these Regulations shall require
the affirmative vote of seven (7) voting members of the Commission for approval.

B. It is the Applicant’s responsibility to submit a complete Application, according to the tiered
Application Submittal Requirements list. The Applicant shall submit all items on Part A of
the Requirements List and shall work with the Town Planner to determine which items on Part
B of the Submittal Requirements List are applicable to this application, with the understanding
that the Commission may make other determinations and instead require additional items from
the list. The Applicant shall demonstrate compliance with all standards and requirements of
these Regulations as well as pay the required fees. Written waiver requests are required for
any applicable Requirement the Applicant wishes to have waived in accordance with these
Regulations.
C. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on any plan of resubdivision and on any plan of
subdivision involving four (4) or more lots. The Commission may hold a public hearing on
any subdivision involving less than four (4) lots if the Commission determines that the
circumstances so warrant. Such hearing shall be held within such time as established by the
Connecticut State Statutes. Notice of a hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Town at least twice at intervals of not less than two days, the first not more than
fifteen nor less than ten days and the second not less than two days prior to the hearing and by
sending a copy thereof to the Applicant and/or representative via post mail or email, as indicated
in their application.
D. The Applicant shall notify all owners of property abutting the site of a proposed subdivision,
and all owners of property within five hundred feet (500’) of any portion of the property
proposed for subdivision, and all holders of conservation easements on the subject or abutting
properties. Notification shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, no later than
seven (7) days after submission of an Application as defined in these Regulations. Notification
shall state that the full Application is available for review in the Woodstock Zoning
Enforcement/Planning Office, and that interested parties may contact the Woodstock Zoning
Enforcement/Planning Office, Woodstock Building Department, for additional information,
and shall state the address and telephone number for each office. Evidence of such notification
in the form of a certificate of mailing shall be promptly filed with the Commission.
E. The Commission may request or receive reports or recommendations from any officer, board,
commission, or agency of the local, state or federal government, or an independent consultant
selected by the Commission, as it may reasonably require in order to evaluate compliance of
the Application with these Regulations.

F. The Commission may perform an official Site Inspection, as a Special Meeting prior to or
during the statutory review period on the Application. The Commission and the Town Planner
may extend invitations to appropriate town officials to participate in the Site Inspection.
G. For a fee-in-lieu of conservation land request by an applicant, such authorization may be
granted by the Commission only if it determines that conditions such as subdivision size,
population densities, existing open space in the neighborhood, topography, soils, or other
characteristics are such that on-site Conservation Land is not as desirable as a fee-in-lieu of
Conservation Land. The Commission shall consult the Town Planner (or designee) and the
Conservation Commission, but if a report on a proposal is not received by the close of the
Commission’s deliberations or Public Hearing, as may be applicable, then the Commission
shall proceed without the Conservation Commission’s input.
H. Upon receipt of all supporting information as required by these Regulations, the Commission
may, at one or more regular or special public meetings, review the Application and shall either
approve, modify and approve, or disapprove any Application within 65 days after the public
hearing, or if no hearing is held, within 65 days following the official receipt thereof. The
Applicant or an authorized representative should attend any public hearing. One or more
extensions, as authorized by the Connecticut General Statutes, may be had with the consent of
the Applicant, provided the total extension does not exceed 65 days.
I. If the Application is modified and approved, the Commission shall specify all modifications
to be reflected on the Final Approved Plan to be endorsed by the Chairman of the Commission.

public improvement or other physical feature shown on the approved Application, the
Applicant must submit sixteen (16) copies of a modified Application. For each Application,
the Applicant shall also submit such additional information and documents as the Commission
may require in order to evaluate the nature and purpose of the proposed modification or
amendment. All provisions of the original approved Application shall be complied with,
except for modifications specifically approved by the Commission.
K. Notice of a decision by the Commission shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Town and a copy thereof sent to the Applicant by certified mail, under the signature of the
authorized Commission staff in any written, printed, typewritten or stamped form, within 15 days
after the decision has been rendered.
L. If at any time the Applicant revises and resubmits an Application (unless such revision is a
condition of the Commission’s approval), it may be deemed a new Application with all
applicable requirements as detailed in these Regulations.

Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
56
CHAPTER VI – DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
Section 1. Site Layout Process
A. Subdivisions
Proposals for subdivisions and for resubdivisions shall follow a design process as described below.
1. Maximum Lot Yield Calculation - According to the type of application (standard major
subdivision, conservation design subdivision, or resubdivision), the Maximum Lot Yield
shall be calculated by taking the acreage of the total parcel and dividing by a Density Factor
to arrive at the Maximum Lot Yield. The Maximum Lot Yield may not be the actual
number of lots realized due to constraints of the total parcel of land’s features and
characteristics, and other standards of the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations.
2. Conservation Land Calculation - According to the type of application (standard major
subdivision, conservation design subdivision, or resubdivision), a defined minimum
acreage shall be set aside as permanently protected Conservation Land. This shall be
calculated as a defined percentage of the total parcel. Conservation Land shall be
delineated according to the Conservation Priorities of the Regulations, including but not
limited to Chapters V and VI of the Subdivision Regulations. Conservation Land may be
comprised of wetlands and/or steep slopes, but the percentage of the dedicated land in these
categories shall be no greater than the percentage of the land in these categories in the total
parcel. For approved recreational or agricultural uses, Conservation land may include areas
designated as sidewalks, roads, driveways, paved parking areas, infrastructure.
3. Development Land Calculation - Development Land shall constitute the remaining
portion of the Total Parcel after delineation of the Conservation Land and any remaining
wetlands, watercourses, and Restricted Land. The Development Land may be divided into
no more lots than the number determined by the Maximum Lot Yield.
4. Family Transfer - The Commission shall not require the provision of Conservation Land.
The Plan of subdivision shall show sufficient contiguous undeveloped land so as to meet
the requirements of these Regulations for provision of Conservation Land in the event the
Commission determines, subsequent to the filing of the Final Approved Plan, that the claim
of exemption from open space requirements under Connecticut General Statute 8-25 was
intended to be temporary or for the purpose of avoiding the Conservation Land
requirements of these Regulations.
5. Fee in Lieu of Conservation Land - As set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut
General Statutes, the Commission may authorize the Applicant to pay a fee to the Town in
lieu of the full requirement to provide Conservation Land for a standard major subdivision.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
57
6. Land Development Based Upon Number of Proposed Lots
a. Minor Subdivision (1-3 lots)
i. There is no lot yield calculation, but each lot must have a minimum of 1.25 acres
of buildable land.
ii. Calculation of the number of lots shall include any existing or developed land to
be divided off into a separate lot or lots (e.g., a parcel of land is to subdivided and
has one existing house to be divided off into its own lot; therefore, no more than
three additional building lots may be allowed on the Total Parcel).
iii. Conservation Land or Fee in Lieu of Conservation Land is not required.
b. Major Subdivision (4 or more lots)
Two options are allowed from which the applicant can choose.
i. Option #1 (Standard Design)
a) A Maximum Lot Yield Calculation is based upon a Density Factor of 2.5
acres. The Lot Yield is rounded to the nearest whole number (round down if
a fraction of a whole number is 0.1-0.4 and round up if 0.5-0.9).
b) Each lot must have a minimum of 1.25 acres of buildable land.
c) 25% of the Total Parcel shall be set aside for Conservation Land.
d) A fee in lieu of conservation land set aside payment may be proposed by an
applicant.
EXAMPLE:
Below is an example of a hypothetical 30-acre subdivision using this calculation
method:
Total Parcel 30 acres
Maximum Allowed Lot Yield
(Total Parcel / Density Factor)
30 /2.5 = 12 lots
Conservation Land (25% of the Total Parcel) 30 x 25%= 7.5 acres
Wetlands, Watercourses, and Restricted Land 10 acres
% of Wetlands, Watercourses, and Restricted
Land as Part of Total Parcel
10 / 30 = 33%
Maximum amount of Wetlands,
Watercourses, and Restricted Land Allowed
in Conservation Land (33%)
33% x 7.5 = 2.5
acres
Other land required in Conservation Land 7.5 – 2.5 = 5 acres
Remaining Wetlands, Watercourses, and
Restricted Land outside of Conservation Land
10 – 2.5 = 7.5 acres
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
58
Net Development Land 30 – 7.5 – 7.5 =
15 acres
Minimum Development Land needed Since
Each Lot Requires 1.25 Acre Minimum
Buildable Land
12 x 1.25 = 15 acres
Maximum Potential Subdivision Lots 15 lots
ii. Option #2 (Conservation Design)
a) A Maximum Lot Yield Calculation is based upon a Density Factor of 1.25
acres. The Lot Yield is rounded to the nearest whole number (round down
if a fraction of a whole number is 0.1-0.4 and round up if 0.5-0.9).
b) Each lot must have a minimum of 1 acre of buildable land.
c) 40% of the Gross Buildable Area shall be set aside for Conservation Land.
d) A fee in lieu of conservation land set aside payment is not allowed.
EXAMPLE:
Below is an example of a hypothetical 30-acre subdivision using this calculation
method:
Total Parcel 30 acres
Maximum Allowed Lot Yield
(Total Parcel / Density Factor)
30 /1.25 = 24 lots
Conservation Land (40% of the Total Parcel) 30 x 40%= 12 acres
Wetlands, Watercourses, and Restricted Land 10 acres
% of Wetlands, Watercourses, and Restricted
Land as Part of Total Parcel
10 / 30 = 33%
Maximum amount of Wetlands,
Watercourses, and Restricted Land Allowed
in Conservation Land (33%)
33% x 12 = 4 acres
Other land required in Conservation Land 12 – 4 = 8 acres
Remaining Wetlands, Watercourses, and
Restricted Land outside of Conservation Land
10 – 4 = 6 acres
Net Development Land 30 – 12 – 6 =
12 acres
Minimum Development Land needed Since
Each Lot Requires 1 Acre Minimum
Buildable Land
24 x 1 = 24 acres
Maximum Potential Subdivision Lots 12 lots
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
59
B. Resubdivisions
1. Proposals for all new resubdivisions shall follow a design process as required above for a
major subdivision, irrespective of the number of lots proposed by the Applicant.
2. The required amount of Conservation Land on any parcel existing as of August, 1965 (an
“Original Parcel”) shall not exceed a cumulative total of 50%. In the case of resubdivision
of Original Parcels, the required acreage of Conservation Land shall be reduced by the
previous required dedication of Conservation Land provided that such reduction shall be
credited proportionately based on the acreage of each parcel proposed for resubdivision
divided by the acreage of the Original Parcel from which it was subdivided.
C. Modification of a Subdivision or Resubdivision
Conservation Land or Fee in Lieu of Conservation Land payment is not required.
Section 2. Conservation Land
A. Conservation Easement or Agricultural Easement Required
1. a development restriction prohibiting all future development, including construction of
any improvement or structure on the parcel except as specifically allowed by these
Regulations. Any proposal for development or construction needs to be provided to the
ZEO (and to the Commission if so determined by the Commission) before development
or construction can occur, so as to determine compliance with the provisions of the
development restriction and with the Regulations.
a. continued use of existing buildings and structures as agreed to by the Commission.
b. expansion of existing buildings or structures or construction of new buildings or
structures, if required for an allowed use (e.g., agriculture or recreation), up to a total
of 1,000 square feet and not on a permanent foundation
c. structures and improvements for storm drainage, sewage treatment, and water supply.
2. a land use restriction prohibiting all future uses except as allowed by the following
provisions. Any proposal for use needs to be provided to the Town ZEO (and to the
Commission if so determined by the Commission) before development or construction
can occur, so as to determine compliance with the provisions of the development
restriction and with the Regulations.
a. sustainable timber harvest using a timber management plan approved by a certified
forester.
b. domestic use of cut wood (not for sale or for commercial purposes).
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
60
c. removal of unsafe trees.
d. removal of invasive tree and vegetation species.
e. removal of trees and/or vegetation at the edge of (still within the Conservation Land)
or within the Conservation Land itself to open the Conservation land for agriculture,
or to protect or improve wildlife habitats (requires a certified management plan).
f. recreation (for examples, playing fields or walking trails).
3. a right to inspect and enforce the development and use restrictions, and to enter the
property for such purposes.
4. a right to assess enforcement costs against the owner(s) of the land.
B. Contextual Priorities
As a guideline, the design of Development Land should be in a manner consistent with the
Conservation Land priorities of Chapter V as follows:
1. Agricultural Land and Prime Agricultural Soils – Site design should avoid division of
agricultural land and should minimize negative impacts on agriculture on and adjacent to
the parcel. Structure and driveway locations should be located so as be clustered at the
edges of open fields, away from areas of existing agricultural activity on or adjacent to the
parcel. Vegetated areas should be preserved where they buffer agricultural operations.
2. Streetscapes and Scenic Roads – Visual and scenic qualities on and along national, state
or locally-designated scenic streets/roads and byways, and where scenic vistas or the
aesthetic qualities of the streetscape contribute significantly to the rural character of the
town.
3. Natural Diversity Habitat Areas – Lots should be configured and structures and
disturbance located so as to provide reasonable protection for natural habitats and
communities as described in the Site Resource Assessment.
4. Historic and Archaeological Resources – Historic and prehistoric structures, sites and
features should be preserved.
5. Stone Walls – Subdivisions should be designed to preserve existing stone walls where
practicable. Applicants are encouraged to reuse stone from portions removed to rebuild
elsewhere on the property, or used to enhance other existing walls on the property.
Wherever practicable, stone walls fronting any existing public or private street shall be
maintained intact. Wherever practicable, stone walls or other natural and manmade features
are encouraged to be used for lot boundary lines and proposed street right-of-way
delineation.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
61
6. Wetlands and Watercourses – In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitats,
development and disturbance should be minimized within the Upland Review Area as
defined by the Woodstock Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission. These
provisions do not require the creation of an undisturbed buffer around any wetland or
watercourse.
7. Large Forest Blocks – Contiguous, unfragmented areas of forest 100 acres or more in size
have significant and unique conservation value. Development and site disturbance should
be located as much as practicable to avoid or minimize the fragmentation or diminution of
existing contiguous Large Forest Blocks on or adjacent to the parcel.
8. Trails – The integrity of existing cart paths, historic ways, discontinued and abandoned
roads, and trails which can serve as connections to Conservation Land or adjacent parcels
should be preserved.
9. Trees - Subdivisions should be designed to preserve healthy mature woodlands, specimen
trees and groups of trees that significantly contribute to the aesthetic or natural character
of the site and adjacent streets, including trees over twelve (12) inches d.b.h., woodlands
and vegetated buffers along roadways, property lines, watercourses, and stone walls as
buffers between adjacent properties and streets.
C. Conservation Land Priorities
The following resources, in the order of priority listed below, shall be incorporated into the
Conservation Land to the maximum extent possible. These resources are important regarding the
general sense of what the Commission looks at as to the planning of open space or a proposal for
fee-in-lieu of open space in a conservation subdivision.
1. Agricultural Land and Prime Agricultural Soils – Areas of Prime Farmland or Farmland
of Additional Statewide Importance, in order to maintain existing and future productive
agricultural potential.
2. Streetscapes and Scenic Roads – Visual and scenic qualities on and along national, state
or locally-designated scenic streets/roads and byways, and where scenic vistas or the
aesthetic qualities of the streetscape contribute significantly to the rural character of the
town.
3. Natural Diversity Habitat Areas – Significant natural communities and wildlife habitats,
based on the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection Natural
Diversity Data Base or shown on the current State and Federal Listed Species and
Significant Natural Communities Map published by the Connecticut Geological and Natural
History Survey of the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection.
4. Historic and Archaeological Sites – Significant known or suspected historic and
archaeological features and sites, including historic ways, foundations, earthworks, and
graves.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
62
5. Large Forest Blocks and Prime Forest Soils – The unfragmented preservation or
conservation of contiguous large forest blocks 100 acres or more in size, whether located in
whole or part on the parcel.
6. Trails and Recreational Access - Existing cart paths, historic ways, discontinued and
abandoned roads, and trails; no trails in Conservation Land shall be designed to
accommodate motor vehicles, with the exception of farm vehicles and vehicles required for
maintenance.
7. Neighborhood Greens, Playing Fields and Playgrounds – At the discretion of the
Commission, a neighborhood green of one half acre or more in size, and playing fields and
playgrounds.
Notwithstanding the above, the prioritization of these resources may be modified for any
particular site by the Commission if such modification better achieves the goals and
objectives of these Regulations, or the Woodstock Plan of Conservation and Development.
Where multiple priorities exist, the guidance provided in APOSC shall be considered.
D. Conservation Land Standards
1. Conservation Land shall be free of all Improvements except for historic structures and
stone walls, necessary accessory buildings intended for agricultural purposes, recreational
use of playing fields and playgrounds, or for storm drainage, sewage treatment or water
supply. For agricultural accessory buildings, the following provisions shall apply:
a. existing buildings are allowed. Existing buildings may be expanded so that the total
area of the overall structure is either no more than one thousand (1,000) square feet for
conservation land of at least five (5) acres or no more than one hundred (100) square
feet for conservation land less than five (5) acres, and any expansion is not on a
permanent foundation.
b. one (1) new building is allowed as follows:
i. no permanent foundation, and
ii. no more than one thousand (1,000) square feet for conservation land of at least five
(5) acres or no more than one hundred (100) square feet for conservation land less
than five (5) acres.
2. To the maximum extent practicable Conservation Land shall be a contiguous parcel, and
shall be undivided by streets or driveways. Conservation Land shall be left in a natural state
and shall not be graded or cleared except as allowed by these Regulations. Conservation
Land shall not be used as a repository for debris.
3. Lots Required - All Conservation Land shall consist of separate and distinct lots, except
that the Commission may approve Conservation Land on the same lot or lots containing
Development Land under the following circumstances:
a. For subdivisions in which all lots are greater than ten (10) acres, up to 50% of
Conservation Land may be located on portions of building lots, that is, Development
Land.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
63
b. For parcels existing on August 25, 2005 with total area of less than ten (10) acres, up
to 100% of the required Conservation Land may be contained or located on portions of
building lots, that is, Development Land.
4. Conservation Land located on portions of building lots, that is, Development Land, shall
be permanently protected by a conservation easement and shall comply with all other
requirements of this Chapter.
5. Access Required - Conservation Land shall have access from a street, or shall abut
Conservation Land or public land having such access. The Commission may require the

dedication requirements shall be made by the Commission after consultation with the Town
Planner and the Conservation Commission guided by the expected maximum benefit to the
Town.
Section 3. Lot Design Specifications
Lots shall be laid out in a manner generally consistent with specifications of this section.
A. Lot Size and Configuration – The size of the lots shall be as required by the Zoning
Regulations of the Town. Corner lots shall be of sufficient dimensions so that any structure
placed thereon shall conform to the front building setback line on each street. All side lines of
lots shall deviate no more than 20 degrees from perpendicular to straight street lines and radial
to curved street lines. There shall not be any fragments of a lot or remainder of a subdivision
area of less than the specified minimum lot area. No lot shall be created, regardless of size,
which is rendered useless for building due to utility easement, rights-of-way, wetlands,
watercourses, or topography. Such property shall be combined with adjacent lots or
Conservation Land. The building setback lines shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning
Regulations.
B. Interior (Rear or “Flag”) Lots, herein defined as lots with an access strip that provides road
frontage that is less than the minimum frontage requirement of the Zoning Regulations and
being primarily positioned behind another lot with adjacent frontage on the same road, shall
not be allowed except as follows:
1. For subdivision of a parcel of ten (10) acres or more, provided these lots are located at the
rear corners of a cul-de-sac or loop road, or
2. For subdivision of a parcel of less than ten (10) acres existing on August 25, 2005, provided
there is no reasonable alternative for access allowing development of the site.
C. Health Requirements and Larger Lots – Unless systems are located in common
Conservation Land, in areas specifically designated by the Commission for this purpose, each
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
65
lot shall have sufficient area to accommodate, where public facilities are not otherwise
provided, a private water supply and a private subsurface sewage disposal system and reserve
area adequate for a minimum four-bedroom residence. The Commission may require lots of
larger size if needed to conform to State or local health requirements or if it is determined,
based on a hydrogeologic analysis of the area, or other reliable data, that larger lots will help
prevent detrimental impacts to existing or proposed water supply wells proximate to the subject
subdivision. No lot shall be approved if found unsuitable for occupancy and building by
reason of utility easements, unstable or adverse soil conditions, topography, water or flooding
conditions, and/or public health concerns related to water supply and/or wastewater disposal;
such lots shall be combined with another adjacent lot or Conservation Land.
D. Lot Design:
1. The design of the lots and location of streets should be consistent with the existing
topography and landscape.
2. Lot lines should follow the configuration of building sites and streets in a logical and
flexible manner.
3. Lot lines should follow existing natural and man-made boundaries such as stone walls, tree
lines and patterns of open fields.
4. Each lot shall have at minimum area for 2 all-weather parking spaces designed so that an
automobile can enter the street from either space without having to move the other
automobile.
E. Building Site Locations – Building site locations shall be identified within the designated
Development Land.
F. Building Locations – The orientation of individual building sites should be such as to maintain
maximum natural topography and cover. Ideally, structures should be oriented in a rational and
pleasing manner in relation to existing and proposed public and private streets.
Section 4. Street Planning
A. Proposed streets, roads and rights-of- way shall be planned in such a manner as to provide safe,
functional, and convenient access to proposed building sites.
B. Streets and roads should follow the contour of the land, with a location and grade which
protects natural and manmade features, minimizes grading cuts and fills and provides a
functional layout that promotes neighborhood compatibility and other conservation design
objectives of these regulations.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VI
66
C. Street planning for new developments shall be done with the purpose of preserving rural streetscapes
and their natural features and minimizing roadway cuts, especially on arterial or collector
streets.
D. Whenever possible, and with due consideration given to topography, streets shall be laid out with
an east-west orientation, so as to facilitate the use of solar collectors on residential structures.
E. Local streets shall provide a safe and convenient system for present and prospective traffic in
the neighborhood around the subdivision and shall be planned where appropriate to provide
for continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas and for projection into adjoining
properties when subdivided.
F. All streets and private roads in a subdivision shall have full access to or shall be a continuation
of one or more State or Town highways.
G. All dead-end streets shall terminate in cul-de-sac or loop.
H. All private roads are to be maintained by a homeowner's association, and are to remain private in
perpetuity subject to a legal agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Commission,
which shall, at the Commission's discretion, be subject to review by the Town Counsel. If the
documents establishing the homeowners’ association are found acceptable by the Commission,
the document shall be filed by the subdivider as part of the Final Approved Plan, in the Office
of the Town Clerk. Appropriate easements shall be provided for travel, utilities, snow storage,
maintenance, storm water drainage, and to accommodate any hammerhead turnaround and
associated snow shelf. All private roads shall be identified on the subdivision plans.
Section 5. Right-of-way Width
A. Street and private road right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with the specifications of
these Regulations, with all streets and roads having a minimum right-of-way of at least 50 feet
(See Table I in Chapter VII).
B. When a subdivision abuts one side of any State or accepted Town street, the subdivider shall
be required to dedicate one-half of the total right-of-way necessary to make said street conform
to these Regulations; in addition, the subdivider may be required to dedicate the full right-ofway
necessary to make horizontal and vertical adjustments to said street. Any such dedication
shall be transferred to the Town by quit-claim deed or warranty deed, and shall be accompanied
by a certification by the subdivider's attorney as to title and release or subordination of all liens
and encumbrances.

Cuts can be spaced apart by distances less than or more than 200 (two hundred) feet, provided that
no more than the maximum allowed Curb Cuts are proposed, except as allowed below. All Curb
Cuts must allow for safe vehicular ingress and egress. The Commission may approve additional
curb cuts to an existing public street as part of the Final Approved Plan if:
A. The provision of additional Curb Cuts to an existing public street produces a pattern of access
and circulation that provides safer vehicular ingress and egress; and
B. The provision of additional Curb Cuts to an existing public street produces a configuration of
lots, Development Land and Conservation Land in the proposed subdivision that satisfies the
requirements and intent of these Regulations in a superior manner.
Section 7. Driveways
A. Driveway Access – Lots shall be laid out so that driveways have access to streets in the
following order of priority: (1) local street; (2) collector street; (3) arterial street.
B. Slope, Sightlines and Drainage – No proposed driveway shall exceed a slope of fifteen (15)
percent. All existing and proposed driveways shall be reconstructed, improved as necessary,
or designed and constructed, in order to prevent drainage problems or unsafe driveway
sightlines along adjacent streets.
C. Common Driveways
1. The Applicant shall demonstrate adequate snow shelf and driveway curb-cut separations at
cul-de-sacs (public or private).
2. Common driveways may serve up to five dwelling units, and shall be paved with bituminous
concrete or gravel to a minimum width of sixteen (16) feet. Final design is site specific and
subject to the recommendation of the Town Engineer. Bituminous concrete pavement is
required where road grade is greater than or equal to 10%. The pavement cross section shall
consist of : 1) 6" rolled gravel sub-base; 2) 4" compacted processed stone base; 3) 1”
compacted bituminous concrete Class I pavement binder course; and 4) 1” compacted
bituminous concrete Class II pavement finish course. The unpaved cross section shall consist

feet from a house site or the applicant shall provide a turnaround of these dimensions as
close to the required distance as practicable. See example diagram.
Section 8. Slopes
Grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of 15 percent or greater shall not result in earth cuts
or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six feet. Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall
be no more than three feet (3) horizontal for each one (1) foot vertical, or as otherwise determined
by the Commission to be required to minimize disturbance of natural grades.
Section 9. Other
Where site conditions, topography, configuration of existing lots, roads, structures, rights-of-way,
legal requirements, or other constraints preclude full compliance with this Chapter V, the applicant
shall consult with the Town Planner to determine recommended priorities and potential site design
alternatives. Where practicable, the Commission may alter the configuration and location of
Conservation Land, Development Land, streets, lots, lot lines, and building sites for the purposes

CHAPTER VII – ROAD, UTILITY AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
Section 1. Construction Standards
A. General – All standards contained within this section shall be considered minimum standards and
may be increased by the Commission where soil conditions or other physical conditions so
require, as may be recommended by the Town Engineer. Streets and related improvements shall
be constructed in accordance with Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges, and Incidental
Construction (Form 817, latest revision) published by the Connecticut Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided by these Regulations or other applicable Town
ordinances or regulations. Upon completion of construction, the developer shall submit an
"as-built" survey. In order to be accepted, all street slopes shall be within 95% of those specified
on the approved plans.
B. Inspection – All streets and other subdivision improvements proposed for dedication to the Town
shall be made available for inspection by the Town’s Consulting Engineer and Highway
Department Foreman, or their designated agents. The inspector shall be notified in writing at least
three (3) working days in advance as to the date of the following stages of construction:
1. Completion of the street subgrade;
2. Completion of drainage structures and pipe, prior to covering;
3. Completion of the first layer of the subbase; and
4. Beginning of construction of the wearing surface.
None of these construction stages shall be undertaken until the previous stage has been inspected
and approved.
C. Graded Width – The Commission may require that streets be graded beyond the full width of the
street up to the full width of the right-of-way based on the recommendation of the Town Engineer
so as to create a storage area for snow, to improve sight distances, to provide drainage, to provide
space for emergency parking, and to facilitate expansion of the street and other improvements.
Should this grading be required, such slopes shall not exceed one (1) inch per one (1) foot (l"/l'0"
= 10%) and shall be extended to the right-of-way line on either side of the street.
D. Side Slopes – Slopes along the outside of the right-of-way line of streets in cut or fill shall not be
steeper than three (3) feet horizontal for each one (1) foot vertical, except that rock cuts may have
greater slopes where proper drainage is provided so that erosion will not result.
E. Street Subgrade – A subgrade for all streets shall be constructed in accordance with the following
minimum standards:
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VII
70
1. Ledge and boulders shall be removed to a depth of eighteen (18) inches below the base course
and refilled with gravel borrow.
2. Immediately in advance of depositing the subbase, the subgrade shall be brought to proper
line, grade, and cross-section as shown on approved plans. Soft, spongy or yielding spots
shall be entirely removed and the space refilled with gravel borrow and thoroughly compacted
by a self-propelled roller weighing at least ten tons.
F. Sub-base: Sub-base material as specified in Section M.02.02 Subsection 1, of Connecticut
Department of Transportation Form 817, latest revision, shall be spread to a minimum total depth
of at least twelve (12) inches after compaction. Construction methods shall be as specified in
Section 2.12 of Connecticut Department of Transportation Form 811.
G. Base Course: Processed stone meeting the requirements of Section M.02.02, Subsection 2, of
Connecticut Department of Transportation Form 817, latest revision, shall be spread to a depth of
at least six (6) inches after compaction by a self-propelled roller weighing at least ten (10) tons.
H. Pavement: The street pavement shall consist of bituminous concrete constructed in two courses
over the gravel base, and meeting the standards of the Connecticut Department of Transportation
Form 817. The finished pavement shall be at least four (4) inches thick, consisting of two (2)
inches of Class 1 binder and two (2) inches of Class 2 surface course. Streets shall be constructed
with a crown or cross pitch of l/4 inch per one (1) foot of distance measured from the centerline
to the edge of the pavement (overall 2% pitch).
I. Curbing: Curbing may be required by the Commission where necessary to ensure adequate
drainage. Curbs shall be backed to their full height by solidly packed earth, a driveway or a
sidewalk. Curbing shall be made of machine laid bituminous concrete and shall conform to the
Zoning and Subdivision Regulations for Cape Cod curbing. Curbing shall be created
monolithically with the creation of the street. Where necessary, driveways shall be provided with
a raised lip to prevent flooding. In no case will street drainage be allowed to cause flooding. In
no case will street drainage be allowed to collect and pond on private property without the proper
easement and right-to-drain having been secured. Where curbing is not used, positive drainage
shall be assured by use of drainage swales, culverts or other means.
J. Private Roads: All private roads shall be built to the standards of Town public roads. The
Commission, in its sole discretion, may approve a wearing surface for private roads that is gravel.
If the Commission approves a gravel-wearing surface for a private road, it may require such
additional construction standards for the road as it deems necessary, based on topography,
drainage, soil conditions, and other related factors. Guidance on the design and construction of a
gravel road may be found in “The Massachusetts Unpaved Roads BMP Manual, Winter 2001”.
The Commission, in its sole discretion, may require any private road to be paved. Bituminous
concrete pavement shall be required wherever the road grade is greater than or equal to 6%, where
a closed drainage system is deemed necessary by the Commission, or where curbing is deemed
necessary by the Commission.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VII
71
Section 2. Street Intersection
A. Where new streets or private roads are to be constructed, a subdivision shall have at least one
street or private road intersecting with an existing Town street or State highway.

D. The center line of alternate side streets shall not be closer than 150 feet, measured along the
center line of the principal street.
E. Except where impractical because of topography or other conditions, the center lines of streets
and roads shall be at right angles to each other for at least 100 feet extending in each direction
from the intersection of the center lines of said street or road.
F. All proposed or future street line intersections shall be connected with an arc having a minimum
radius of fifteen (15) feet.
Section 3. Terminus Street
A. A terminus street is intended to provide residential areas with adequate vehicular access while
maintaining privacy and minimizing traffic flow.
B. A terminus street shall be designed as either a loop street or a cul-de-sac in accordance with
standards of this Chapter.
C. Whenever possible a terminus street shall be designed as a loop street rather than a cul-de-sac.
D. A terminus street shall be considered to begin where it intersects with a through street.
Section 4. Loop Streets
A. If a loop street is designed as a one-way boulevard with a vegetated middle area (median), then
the paved width of the travel portion of the road shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet with
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VII
72
a minimum right of way of forty (40) feet and one-way signage posted at the entrance to the
loop.
B. If adequate acreage and site conditions exist, the interior of the loop street may be used as a
building site, with the front side being on the loop street.
C. Use of the interior area of a loop street as a Neighborhood Green, Playing Field or Playground
is encouraged.
Section 5. Cul-de-sacs
See diagram.
A. A cul-de-sac shall not exceed 2,000 feet in length.
B. A cul-de-sac shall terminate in an elongated turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius
of 60 feet and a minimum radius of 50 feet. Right-of-way and paved roadway shall be enlarged
where the turnaround joins the rest of the street by reverse curves of the same radii as the
turnaround.
C. No curbing shall be allowed in the snow stockpile area of a cul-de-sac, unless otherwise
authorized by the Commission for purposes of drainage.
D. An island shall be left in the center of the turnaround, provided: the radius of such island leaves a
paved roadway at least 25 feet wide.
E. Utility poles are not allowed in the island.
F. Options for the island in the cul-de-sac:
1. Landscaping in the form of a rain garden planted with suitable, low-lying, non-invasive plants.
The rain garden can be incorporated into the overall drainage system for any overflow.
2. Where a rain garden is not practical due to the unique nature of the site, the island can be
designed to work with the drainage system and incorporate low-lying, non-invasive plants for
landscaping.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VII
73
Section 6. Temporary Cul-de-sac
A. A street designed as a temporary cul-de-sac shall terminate in a temporary turnaround as
described above.
B. Only the area within such street that constitutes an extension of the normal street right-of-way
shall be dedicated to the Town, but such dedicated area shall extend flush to the boundary of
the tract proposed for subdivision. The area outside this normal width of street right-of-way,
which is dedicated to the Town in the case of a permanent cul-de-sac, shall follow the
ownership of the abutting lots, but the Town shall be given a right-of-way easement for such
area. The additional, defeasible easement shall be temporary and shall terminate upon
extension of the street. The developer who extends a street from a cul-de-sac shall be required
to remove the existing pavement outside of the normal paved roadway width and to loam and
seed the original turnaround area at his own expense.
Section 7. Temporary Turnaround
A. Temporary turnarounds may be required where it can reasonably be expected that the street
will continue onto adjoining land in the future or where a permanent cul-de-sac is shorter than
allowed above and said street is likely to be extended to provide access to maximum lots or
distance allowed.
B. Temporary turnarounds shall be designed and constructed to Town specifications.
C. Land for a temporary turnaround shall be provided in the form of a defeasible easement to the
Town, which shall contain a condition for automatic termination of the easement upon
extension of the street.
D. Pavement of the temporary turnaround shall be removed upon the termination of the easement
and as a condition of the projection of the street into the adjoining property. The subdivider
who provides the extension of the street shall remove the pavement for the temporary
turnaround, and the same subdivider shall also improve the street in the area of the turnaround
to meet specifications of the Town.
Section 8. Street Width
All roads shall be constructed to the widths and dimensions shown below in Table I. Such width may
be increased by the Commission to accommodate safety standards for current or future traffic.

duplicate or closely approximate in spelling or sound like existing street names in Woodstock or
any adjoining city or town. One street name sign and supporting post shall be installed at all street
intersections at the expense of the subdivider and shall conform to the standards of the Town.
Section 10. Street Lighting
When required by the Commission for public safety, the subdivider shall install street lights at all
intersections, including intersections of new streets with existing streets. The subdivider shall be
responsible for all operating and maintenance costs until the streets are accepted by the Town.
Street lighting shall be installed in accordance with standards established by the Town. Lighting
fixtures shall be selected so as to promote safe intersections while taking into account the goals of
minimizing the amount of lighting, preventing undesirable illumination or glare above the site and
preventing light spill (undesirable light that falls outside the area of intended illumination).
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter VII
75
Section 11. Landscaping
The entrance to the new street or private road shall be landscaped to visually ease the transition
from the existing street. The subdivider shall incorporate existing natural vegetation, stone walls
and other features to the maximum extent possible in such landscaping. The new street or private
road shall only be cleared of existing vegetation to provide for safety, drainage, construction, snow
shelf and utilities.

activities will take place in or adjacent to significant vegetation or site features, the limit of
disturbance shall be delineated and such vegetation protected through installation of temporary
fencing or other approved measures. Such fencing or other delineation shall be installed prior
to commencing of and shall be maintained throughout the period of construction activity.
C. Protection of Vegetation from Grading Change and Excavation – Grade changes and
excavation to occur at any location of the property shall not result in an alteration to soil or
drainage conditions which would adversely affect existing vegetation to be retained following
site disturbance, unless adequate provisions are made to protect such vegetation and its root
systems. When digging trenches for utility lines or similar uses, disturbances to the root zones
of all woody vegetation shall be minimized. All stumps shall be removed from the site and
disposed of properly.
D. Protection of Topsoil – Topsoil removal from the site shall be the minimum amount required
for construction purposes. To minimize environmental impact, if suitable, topsoil from the site
should first be used to stabilize the site or to provide the required fill to complete the site work
before it is to be removed from the site. Topsoil to be redistributed around the site shall be
stabilized as quickly as possible following the establishment of required grades for a project or
project phase. All exposed earth surfaces shall be reseeded and stabilized. At least six inches
(6”) depth of topsoil shall be provided to cleared areas around each building site.

gallons.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter IX
80
CHAPTER IX - STORM WATER, AND EROSION & SEDIMENT
CONTROL
Section 1. Applicability
An Application for subdivision or resubdivision shall meet the pollution control requirements of
this Chapter. An Application shall include a complete Storm Water Pollution Control Plan that
satisfactorily prevents pollution caused by soil erosion and sedimentation during and after
construction and storm water pollution caused by use of the site after construction is completed.
The Applicant and Developer shall ensure that adequate storm water pollution control and erosion
and sedimentation control measures, structures and practices are an integral part of each Plan of
Subdivision and are fully constructed, implemented and maintained during and after development.
Section 2. Storm Water Pollution Control
A. Storm Water Pollution Control Requirements
A subdivision or resubdivision shall be designed so as to comply with and adhere to all of the
following:
1. The guiding principles and design techniques of The Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection 2004 Connecticut Storm Water Quality Manual, as may be
amended from time to time, (hereinafter referred to as “The Connecticut Storm water
Quality Manual”);
2. The requirements of the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control,
as may be amended from time to time;
3. The requirements of The Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection
General Permit for the Discharge of Storm Water and Dewatering Wastewaters from
Construction Activities, as may be amended from time to time, including development and
implementation of the “Storm Water Pollution Control Plan” required under the General
Permit;
4. The requirements and standards of this Chapter; and,
5. All other applicable Federal, State and local regulations and requirements.
B. Storm Water Pollution Control Standards – A subdivision or resubdivision shall be designed
so as to meet the following standards for storm water pollution control:
1. Preserve pre-development site hydrology (i.e., runoff, infiltration, interception,
evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and stream baseflow) to the extent possible;
2. After construction has been completed and the site is permanently stabilized, reduce the
average annual total suspended solids loadings by eighty (80) percent. For high quality
receiving waters and sites with the highest potential for significant pollutant loadings,
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter IX
81
reduce post-development pollutant loadings so that average annual post-development
loadings do not exceed pre-development loadings (i.e.: no net increase)
3. Preserve and protect wetlands, stream buffers, natural drainage systems and other natural
features that provide water quality and quantity benefits;
4. Manage runoff velocity and volume in a manner that has minimal impact on the physical
and biological character of existing drainage systems and prevents increases in downstream
flooding/streambank erosion;
5. Prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters and wetlands in amounts that exceed the
systems’ natural ability to assimilate the pollutants and provide the desired functions; and,
6. Seek multi-objective benefits (i.e., flood control, water quality, recreation, aesthetics,
habitat) from storm water control measures.
C. Storm Water Pollution Control
1. Site Planning and Design Standards – Effective site planning and design techniques shall
be incorporated in the proposed plan of subdivision or resubdivision to the maximum extent
possible as the primary method to meet the Storm Water Pollution Control Standards of this
Chapter. The Low Impact Development Management Practices of Section 4.4 of The
Connecticut Storm Water Quality Manual shall be incorporated whenever feasible.
2. Storm Water Treatment Practices – Where site planning and design techniques will be
insufficient to meet the Storm Water Pollution Control Standards, or it is not feasible to use
Low Impact Development Management Practices, the Proposed Plan of Subdivision or
Resubdivision shall incorporate storm water treatment practices as described in Chapter 6
of The Connecticut Storm Water Quality Manual sufficient to meet the Storm Water
Pollution Control Standards. Whenever such storm water treatment practices are required,
storm water wetlands, infiltration practices, and water quality swales shall be preferred.
Storm water ponds and detention basins shall be avoided whenever possible and shall be
designed, when necessary, to minimize size and number. Storm water ponds and detention
basins shall be located and designed to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to adjacent
properties, existing or proposed streets, conservation lands, and parks and playgrounds.
Storm water ponds and detention basins shall be screened by appropriate earthen or
vegetated buffers where desirable in the judgment of the Commission.
3. Inspection, Maintenance and Repair of Storm Water Treatment Facilities – The
Storm Water Pollution Control Plan shall specify the manner by which all improvements,
structures or facilities designed or intended for storm water treatment will be maintained
in good working order, and shall specify the person(s) responsible for inspection,
maintenance and repair. The Commission may require that regular reports be submitted to
the Town Engineer or other party designated by the Commission concerning such
inspection, maintenance and repair. The Commission may require that a bond be posted
with the Town to ensure that necessary maintenance and repairs are performed. The
Commission may require that inspection, maintenance and repair be the responsibility of a
homeowners association. The Commission may further require that if a responsible party
fails to conduct any necessary inspection, maintenance or repair action, the Town or its
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter IX
82
designee shall have the authority to accomplish such inspection, maintenance or repair and
shall assess the costs of such action against the homeowners association or against the
owners of lots within the subdivision.
All improvements, structures or facilities designed or intended for storm water treatment
shall be accessible for inspection. Where such improvements, structures or facilities are
not located on public land or within a public right-of-way an easement shall be granted in
favor of the Town for inspection, maintenance and repair of all improvements, structures
and facilities.
4. Authority of the Commission – All improvements, structures or facilities designed or
intended for storm water treatment, including storm water ponds and detention basins, shall
be designed and located in a manner the Commission deems consistent with these
Regulations. The Commission may modify or deny an Application if it finds that the
proposed plan will not meet the Storm Water Pollution Control Standards or the
requirements of these Regulations.
Section 3. Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
An Application for subdivision or resubdivision shall include or incorporate a Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan. The Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall contain proper provisions
to adequately control accelerated erosion and sedimentation and to reduce the danger from storm
water runoff on the proposed site based on the best available technology and the principles, methods
and practices of the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as may be
amended from time to time.
A. General Requirements for Erosion Control – The terms and phrases used herein refer
to specifications contained in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control. Such Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and supporting narrative
shall consist of:
1. Property lines, wetlands, stream courses, topography, and all proposed roads and other
improvements shall be shown on the plan described in these Regulations.
2. Locations of areas to be stripped of vegetation and other exposed or unexposed areas including
soil types.
3. The proposed area alterations and a schedule of operations to include starting and completion
dates for major development phases, such as land clearing and grading, street, sidewalk and
storm sewer installation, and sediment control measures.
4. Sequence of grading and construction activities.
5. Sequence for installation and/or application, of erosion and sediment control measures.
6. Sequence for final stabilization of project site.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter IX
83
7. Location and design details for all erosion and sediment control measures and storm water
management facilities including structures such as diversions, waterways, grade
stabilization structures, debris, etc.
a. The operation and maintenance program for the proposed erosion and sediment control
measures and storm water management facilities.
b. All other requirements as contained in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control as may be amended from time to time.
B. Minimum Acceptable Standards – Plans for soil erosion and sediment control shall be
developed in accordance with these Regulations using the principles as outlined in Chapters 3 and
4 of the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as amended. A Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall only be certified by the Commission for a development
that (1) minimizes erosion and sedimentation during construction; (2) is stabilized and protected
from erosion when completed; and, (3) does not cause off-site erosion or sedimentation. The
minimum standards for individual measures shall be those in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for
Soil and Erosion Control, as amended.
C. Issuance or Denial of Certification – The Commission shall either certify that the Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control Plan, as filed, complies with the requirements and standards of this Chapter
and the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as amended, or shall
deny certification when the Plan does not comply with such Regulations and Guidelines. The
Commission shall deny an Application if it denies certification of the Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan. Approval of a Final Approved Plan of Subdivision or Resubdivision by the
Commission after review and evaluation of the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be
deemed to be certification of such Plan as required by C.G.S. Sec. 22a-329.
D. Conditions Relating to Soil Erosion and Sediment Control – The Commission may refer these
plans to the Eastern Connecticut Conservation District or other agency or person for consultive
technical assistance.
Measures to be taken to control soil erosion and sedimentation, if required, shall be described and
provided for in the Final Approved Plan. The estimated cost of accomplishing such measures may
be covered in a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Bond provided by the Applicant and
acceptable to the Commission.
E. Inspection – Inspection may be made by the Commission or its designated agent to ensure
compliance with the certified Plan and to verify that control measures and facilities have been
properly performed or installed according to the certified Plan and are being properly operated
and maintained.
Section 4. Special Flood Hazard Areas
A. The Commission shall review subdivision proposals to determine whether such proposals will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal is in a designated flood-prone area, i.e.,
within Zone A on the Woodstock Flood Hazard Boundary Map, any such proposal shall be
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter IX
84
reviewed to assure that all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
within the flood prone areas; all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate
drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and all such proposals are in accordance
with the requirements of the Town of Woodstock Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, adopted
at Town Meeting, October 25, 1984.
B. All subdivision proposals which are situated within Zone A on the Woodstock Flood Hazard
Boundary Map, shall include within such Application base flood elevation data.
C. In the absence of base flood elevation data which may be furnished by the Federal Insurance
Administrator, the Commission shall with the assistance of the Applicant obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data from a Federal, State or other source, until such
other data has been provided by the Administrator, as criteria for meeting the provisions of the
preceding paragraph.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter X
85
CHAPTER X – INSURANCE AND BONDS
A formal application for subdivision or resubdivision shall meet the Bonding requirements of the
Zoning Regulations, Article VI, Town-wide Regulations.
Section 1. Insurance
The Developer shall file with the Commission a certificate providing evidence of the existence of
an insurance policy with general liability limits as required below. This policy shall be in effect
for the length of the Performance Bond and shall be extended in conformance with any extension
of the Performance and Maintenance Bond.
The policy shall insure the Town and the Developer against all claims for damage or injury to
persons or property that may arise from the construction, installation, or maintenance, or lack
thereof, of any subdivision improvements, or from any operations in the development or
completion of the subdivision, including but not limited to clearing, removal of vegetation,
grading, excavating, filling, inspection, testing, well installation, sediment and erosion control
measures, and road construction and improvement. The policy shall have the following limits:
A. Property Damage (including automobile)
Each Accident: Not less than $2 million
B. Bodily Injury (including automobile)
Each Person: Not less than $2 million
Each Accident: Not less than $2 million
Section 2. Bonding
A. Completion – The Commission may, with the advice of the Town Engineer and Town
Planner, prescribe the extent to which and manner in which the required improvements,
including but not limited to streets, utilities, drainage, erosion control measures,
landscaping, markers and services, be provided in connection with any subdivision plan
prior to final approval of the plan. The Commission may require that all or a specified
portion of such work and installations be completed prior to the filing of the subdivision
on the Land Records.
B. Performance Bond – In lieu of completion of all or part of the required improvements,
the Commission may require the Developer to file with the Town a Performance Bond of
sufficient amount, as prepared by the Developer and approved by the Town Engineer, to
secure to the Town the actual cost of construction and installation of such improvements.
The period within which required improvements shall cover the full construction and
installation period for the final improvements, and shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission. The Performance Bond shall be posted at any time prior to the completion of
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter X
86
the construction and installation of any public improvements. Bonds for erosion and
sedimentation control controls shall be submitted prior to the commencement of any
improvements. No lot shall be transferred to a buyer before any required financial
guarantee is submitted or before the public improvements and utilities are completed to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Commission or its agent.
C. Bond Amount – The amount of a Performance Bond as established by the Commission
shall reflect:
1. The construction cost of all required improvements, including storm drainage system,
roads and pavements, sidewalks and curbs, trees, grading, setting of monuments, and
any other requirements made as a condition for subdivision approval or depicted on the
endorsed Final Approved Plan, Plan and Profile, and Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Plan.
2. Costs for the Town to advertise and award a contract for construction of the
improvements or site restoration.
3. Costs shall be projected to a point at the end of the improvements construction period.
Any extension of the term of the Performance Bond may result in an adjustment as to
the Bond total.
4. The total estimated cost of the Performance Bond shall also include a 20% addition
to cover contingencies and engineering.
5. Where a subdivision is to be developed in phases, the developer may petition the
Commission in writing for permission to post a Performance Bond covering the costs
itemized in paragraphs (c) 1 through 4 above, related to those improvements and
utilities located within or required to serve one or more phases rather than for the entire
development. Similar permission shall be obtained by the developer prior to
commencing development of any or all additional phases. Where the developer bonds
in phases as authorized in this paragraph, no improvement, as that term is defined in
these Regulations, shall be commenced in any phase for which no Bond has been
posted.
D. Form of Bond – All Bonds required under this section shall be in the form of a certified
check payable to the town; a savings passbook; an irrevocable sight draft letter of credit
from a bank chartered to do business in Connecticut; or a certificate of deposit in the name
of the Town to be held in escrow by the Town, together with a letter from the Developer
stating that the Bond is being provided in accordance with the approved site plan and may
be drawn against by the Town, if necessary, all in form and substance acceptable to the
Commission and its Legal Counsel.
If at any time, the Bond required by this Section shall not be in effect for incomplete or
unaccepted public improvements, the Commission may file a caveat on the Land Records
warning potential purchasers of such fact.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter X
87
E. Term – The term of any Performance Bond proposed by the developer should be
approximately 150% of the proposed period of development. The developer shall be
entitled to complete all required subdivision improvements within the time allowed by state
law, provided the developer continuously maintains the Performance Bond, or a substitute
Performance Bond acceptable to and approved by the Commission in accordance with
these Regulations, for the full duration of such time. If, at any time, the Performance Bond
lapses, is terminated or withdrawn, or ceases to be effective or in force, regardless of
whether the developer is responsible for such circumstances, the subdivision approval shall
lapse and become null and void except as provided hereafter. Within 60 days prior to the
date of any such lapse, termination, withdrawal, or cessation of the effectiveness of any
such Performance Bond, the developer may submit to the Commission a written request
for approval of a substitute Performance Bond. The Commission may deny such request if
it determines that such proposed substitute Performance Bond does not provide adequate
security for the timely completion of all required subdivision improvements and utilities or
if it determines that the developer has failed to comply with any terms or conditions of the
subdivision approval or any of these Regulations. The Commission may also approve the
provision of a substitute Performance Bond different in form and amount than that
requested by the developer. In the event the Commission approves the provision of a
substitute Performance Bond, the developer shall be allowed 30 days following the date of
such approval to submit the substitute Performance Bond. The Commission may, upon the
developer’s written request, extend the time within such substitute Performance Bond may
be provided by no more than an additional 30 days. If the developer fails to provide the
substitute Bond within such period of 30-60 days, or if the developer fails to submit a
written request for approval of a substitute Bond within the time set for above, the
subdivision approval shall become immediately and irrevocably null and void. Nothing in
this section will prevent or prohibit subsequent subdivision of the property.
F. Separate Sediment and Erosion Control Bond – Measures and facilities specified on the
approved Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be guaranteed by a separate
performance Bond (the “Erosion and Sediment Control Bond”) which shall be posted prior
to the commencement of any construction or installation. In the event the Developer fails
to maintain proper sedimentation and erosion controls on the subdivision site, the Bond
required under this section may be used by the Town to stabilize eroding areas, remove
sediment, and otherwise correct sedimentation and erosion problems on site at the sole
discretion of the Commission or its designated agent.
G. Default – In the event the subdivision approval terminates or lapses before all required
subdivision improvements and utilities have been completed, the Commission may, in its
discretion, and subject to any contrary provisions of state law, use the funds available in
the Performance Bond and/or Sedimentation and Erosion Control Bond at its option to
complete improvements or restore all or any portion of the site to a natural condition. The
Commission shall not make any decision to use a Bond for restoration without obtaining
an estimate for the costs of both restoration and completion of all required improvements
and utilities from the Town Engineer or a similarly qualified consultant.
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter X
88
Section 3. Application of Bonds
The Commission may call any Bond and apply the proceeds of such Bond to the construction and
installation of required subdivision improvements and utilities or the restoration of the site in any
of the following circumstances:
A. If the Commission has called the Bond under this section, and the expiration or termination
date of the Bond is subsequently extended for a period of no less than one (1) additional year,
or a replacement Bond of equivalent or greater amount is subsequently provided with terms
and conditions, and in a form satisfactory to the Commission, the Commission shall have the
option of proceeding to complete any portion of the required subdivision improvements and
utilities under the original Bond or accepting the extended or replacement Bond in lieu of
completing such improvements.
B. The Commission may call the Bond at any time within sixty (60) days before the date, as it
may have been extended, on which the approval of the subdivision is scheduled to expire under
any applicable provision of state or local law if any portion of the required subdivision
improvements or utilities has not been completed.
C. The Commission may call the Bond at any time to complete any portion of the required
improvements or utilities the Commission deems reasonably necessary to serve any lots within
the subdivision that have been sold or otherwise conveyed.
ANY PERSON WHO SUBMITS AN APPLICATION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF A
SUBDIVISION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF A BOND IN LIEU OF THE
COMPLETION OF ALL REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITIES SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED ALL OF THE
FOREGOING TERMS. THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT ISSUE ANY FINAL
APPROVAL OF A SUBDIVISION APPLICATION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF
A BOND UNLESS THE APPLICANT AGREES TO ABIDE BY THE FOREGOING
PROVISIONS.
Section 4. Bond Release
A. Application for the release of any Bond upon completion of all required improvements shall
include the submission of properly scaled as-built drawings, which shall include all changes in
the plans as authorized by the Commission during the course of construction. The as-built
drawings shall be signed and sealed by a Connecticut Registered Land Surveyor licensed in
the State of Connecticut.
B. Prior to the release of the Performance Bond the developer shall present a Maintenance Bond
equal to ten (10%) percent of the full amount (i.e., the highest amount set by the Commission
before any subsequent reductions) of the Performance Bond. The Maintenance Bond shall be
for a period of twelve (12) months and shall guarantee the improvements installed against
Town of Woodstock Subdivision Regulations: Chapter X
89
defects in materials or workmanship, or damage caused to the improvements by any
construction activity in the subdivision. The twelve (12)-month period shall commence upon
the effective date of the acceptance of any road and all other public improvements by the Town.
The Developer shall repair all defects in construction or operation of required improvements
occurring during the period covered by the Maintenance Bond. The Developer’s failure to
perform needed repairs within thirty (30) days when so requested by the Commission or their
designate may result in the Town’s undertaking the repairs and billing the Developer for the
cost of repair and/or applying funds from the Maintenance Bond to correct the condition.
C. Upon submission of a written report from the Town Engineer, which shall be reviewed by the
Town Planner, that all or a certain specified stage in the construction of improvements has
been satisfactorily completed, the Developer may request that the Commission reduce any
outstanding Bond to reflect the cost of construction of the remaining improvements. Within
sixty five (65) days of a request to release all or a portion of such bond, the Commission shall
either (1) release the security or a part thereof or (2) provide a written explanation of the
additional improvements that must be completed before the bond or portion thereof may be
released. The Commission shall refuse such reductions if it finds the construction of any
improvements in violation of any provision of these Regulations or the plans, terms, or
conditions for any subdivision approved hereunder.
Section 5. Agreement for Installation of Improvements
An Application for approval of a subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of
public improvements shall constitute an agreement by the Applicant to be personally responsible
for the completion of any portions of the improvements the Commission may deem necessary to
serve any lots that may be conveyed following approval of the plan. The Commission’s ability to
call a Bond or other surety pursuant to CT General Statute Section 8-26c (c) shall not prevent the
Commission from enforcing the personal responsibility of the Applicant to complete the necessary
improvements.
Section 6. Certificate of Zoning Compliance
Before any Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for any building in such subdivision on a lot
that fronts on a subdivision road that has not been accepted by the Town as a public road, the
developer must complete such road, in accordance with all applicable specifications, up to the
farther side line of such lot plus an additional distance that shall be provided for emergency
vehicles to turn around, to a stage in construction at which only final surfacing of the road remains
to be done before completion of the road. The foregoing condition shall not apply to street trees,
sidewalks, or other types of road-related improvements not required for vehicular travel, but shall
apply to the installation of street name signs to facilitate the provision of emergency services. The
balance of the work on such road, and all other public improvements, must also be bonded in
accordance with the provisions of these Regulations. In addition, water supplies and effluent
disposal systems shall be operational and accepted by the appropriate Town or State agencies prior
to the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance allowing the occupancy of a dwelling on
any lot.

Town of Woodstock, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
Effective June 4, 2007 with amendments through February 2, 2009 2
Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed.
The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply
of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to
the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal,
aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in
danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of
material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all
of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated
activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and
benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the
wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses,
disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety
of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens
of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the
inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining
and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and
other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural
habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality
of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other
public and private uses and values; and protecting the states potable fresh water supplies from the
dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly
process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the
need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the
state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and
enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the “Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the
Town of Woodstock.”
1.3 The Woodstock Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency of the Town of Woodstock was
established in accordance with an ordinance adopted 1971, and shall implement the purposes and
provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of
Woodstock.
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with
the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue,
Town of Woodstock, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations

years of age or older and who reside in the municipality in which the regulated activity is
proposed, requesting a hearing is filed with the inland wetlands agency not later than fourteen
days after the date of receipt of such application, or the inland wetlands agency finds that a public
hearing regarding such application would be in the public interest. The inland wetlands
agency may issue a permit without a public hearing provided no petition provided for in this
section is filed with the inland wetlands agency on or before the fourteenth day after the date of
receipt of the application. Such hearing shall be held no later than sixty-five days after the receipt
of such application. All applications and maps and documents relating thereto shall be open for

testimony.
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45,
inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating, licensing
and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts
and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses;
b. the applicant’s purpose for, 1 and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed
regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to
wetlands or watercourses;
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated
activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity of such wetlands or watercourses.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be
caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity
would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any
mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for
Town of Woodstock, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
Effective June 4, 2007 with amendments through February 2, 2009 21
such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution
or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality,
or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland
or watercourse resources;

use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and
f. impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area
for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related
to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated
activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the Agency
that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit
shall not be issued unless the Agency finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent
alternative does not exist. In making this finding the Agency shall consider the facts and
circumstances set forth in subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore
shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible
and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on
wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose on the record in writing the types of
alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to
shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present
alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands and watercourses” includes aquatic, plant or animal
life, and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) “habitats” means areas or environments in
which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 The Agency shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside
wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life
unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or
watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall base its
decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing
record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision.
10.8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to
subsection 7.11a of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide proof to the
Agency that granting of the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction. Upon
a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction, the Agency shall
not grant permit approval.

subsections 7.11a or 7.11b of these regulations, the party holding the conservation or
preservation restriction may, not later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of actual notice
of permit approval, file an appeal with the Agency, subject to the rules and regulations of
Town of Woodstock, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
Effective June 4, 2007 with amendments through February 2, 2009 22
