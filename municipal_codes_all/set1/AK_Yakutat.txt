Notice of the revocation or suspension shall be sent or delivered to the owner in the same manner as provided in subsection A above. 
C. If requested, a hearing shall be conducted before the Borough Manager, or his designee, (hereinafter referred to as the hearing officer) no sooner than five days after receipt of the written demand from the owner. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The parties may present witnesses and evidence on their behalf, and may cross-examine opposing witnesses on matters relevant to the issue and rebut evidence presented by the other. The sole issue at the hearing shall be whether the Borough has presented sufficient evidence demonstrating grounds for revocation or suspension of the business license under CCBY 1.28.070. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the owner. 
D. Either party may appeal the hearing officer's decision to the Borough Assembly, by filing a notice of appeal with the Borough Clerk within ten days of the date of the hearing officer's decision. The procedures for such an appeal shall be established by the Assembly. 
E. At any time prior to revocation or suspension of the business license, the owner may submit evidence to the Borough that the grounds for revocation or suspension have been eliminated or corrected, and request that the proceedings on revocation or suspension be closed.

C. A person supplying services as a bona fide employee for wages subject to federal income tax withholding; and 
D. A person who makes only "casual sales" of goods or services, as that term is defined in CCBY 6.40.030(B).

Any unpaid business license fee, and/or any penalties imposed under this Chapter, shall constitute a lien in favor of the Borough upon all of the real and personal property of the person(s) or entity(ies) owing the fee and/or penalties. The lien also includes any administrative costs, including attorney fees and litigation costs, incurred by the Borough to bring a business into compliance with this Chapter and fees paid to the District Recorder for recording the lien and any necessary fees for recording a lien satisfaction.

is recognized.

the subject under debate, shall refrain from discussing
personalities, and shall not refer to any other member of the

ten minutes continuously to any one question, except that one or 
more additional periods of ten minutes may be granted by

shall be entertained unless it is seconded, and no other 
business shall be in order until the question on appeal has been
decided. The question on appeal shall be put as follows: 
"Shall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the 

Assembly?" It shall be deemed to be decided in the affirmative 
unless a majority of votes given are to the contrary.

officer at any time during the meeting.

9.

B. When one of the above motions has been made, none of 
the others inferior to it in the order in which they stand above 
shall be made, and in proceeding to vote, motions pending shall 
be put in the order of their rank as above arranged. A motion 
to postpone indefinitely may be amended; the previous question 

may be demanded before an amendment, which motion shall be 
decided without debate. A motion to adjourn shall always be in
order, provided that business of a nature to be recorded in the 
journal has been transacted since any previous motion to adjourn 
has been defeated. No motion or proposition of a subject 
different to that under consideration shall be admitted under 
color of an amendment. 

C. When a matter has been especially assigned to be taken 
up at a fixed time, or at a certain stage of proceedings, such
matter shall, at the appointed time or at any time subsequent 
thereto, be in order upon the call of any member, and take 
precedence over all other business. 

2.12.120 Motions --Division of Question. Any member may 
require the division of a question, when the sense of it will
admit. 

2.12.130 Motions --Putting Questions in Order Moved. The 
presiding officer shall put all questions in the order in which 
they are moved unless a subsequent motion shall be previous in 
its nature, except that when naming sums and fixing times the 
largest sum and the longest time shall be put first. 

2.12.140 Motions --Ordering Previous Question. When the 
previous question is moved by any member, all debate on the main 
question shall be suspended immediately and the presiding 
officer shall put the question in the following form: "The 
previous question is moved on [specifying the motion on which
the previous question is demanded]. As many as are in favor of 
ordering the previous question will so indicate." If the 
majority assent, the affirmative has it, the previous question
is ordered, and the chair will proceed immediately to put to a
vote the question on which the previous question was ordered.
If less than the majority so indicates, the negative has it, the
motion is lost, and the question reverts to the immediately
pending question which is again open to debate and amendment as 
if the previous question had not been demanded. 

2.12.150 Motions --Reduction to Writing. Any motion must
be reduced to writing if the presiding officer so requires or 
any member so demands, and no other motion shall be entertained 
until reasonable time (not over ten minutes) is afforded for 
compliance with this rule. 

2.12.160 Motions --Amending Amendments. A motion to 
amend an amendment shall be in order; but a motion to amend an 
amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained. 

2.12.170 Motion to Reconsider. When a vote has been taken 
either passing or defeating any proposition or legislation, any 
Assembly member who voted on the prevailing side may move for 
reconsideration at the same meeting or at the next succeeding
meeting whenever motions are in order, provided that the subject
matter has not passed out of the control of the Assembly. The 
term "prevailing side" includes the negative side which has 
prevailed because the affirmative side has failed to muster the
requisite number of votes required for passage of the measure.
A motion to reconsider requires a majority of affirmative votes 
and, if it prevails, the subject shall be open to debate and 
amendment in the same manner as the original question. Debates 
on motions to reconsider shall be limited to twenty-five minutes 
and no member shall speak for more than five minutes. No 
measure shall be reconsidered more than once. 

2.12.180 Motions --Rescinding Vote. Any previous vote
may be rescinded by vote of the majority of the Assembly at any 
time, provided the subject has not passed out of the control of
the Assembly. 


2.12.190  Voting.  

A. The presiding officer shall declare all votes; but if 
any member doubts a vote, the presiding officer, without further
debate upon the question, shall request the members voting in 
the affirmative and negative respectively to so indicate, and he 
shall declare the result. 

B. The vote upon all matters considered by the Assembly
shall be taken by "yes" or "no" votes which shall be entered 
upon the record, except that when the vote is unanimous it shall
be necessary only to so state.

C. Every member who shall be present when a question is 
put, where he is not disqualified by personal interest, shall 
vote, unless the Assembly for special reason excuses him. 
Applications to be so excused must be made before the vote, and
shall be decided without debate. 

D. Anything to the contrary in these rules 
notwithstanding, in all cases where an extraordinary majority is
not required, and when no motion is before the Assembly, the 
presiding officer may, in lieu of calling for or awaiting a 
motion to be made, put the question in the following form:  
"Without objection, it will be so ordered." If no objection is 

heard, he shall announce: "It is so ordered," which will have 
the same effect as if a motion to that effect had been made and 
voted upon favorably. If a single objection is reasonably
expressed when the question is put, the presiding officer shall 
not proceed further under this rule, but instead shall call for 
a motion, which motion shall be handled in the regular manner. 


2.12.200  Quorum --Voting.  

A. Four Assembly members constitute a quorum. Four 
affirmative votes are required for the passage of an ordinance,
resolution or motion. 

B. The final vote on each ordinance, resolution or 
substantive motion is a recorded roll call vote. All Assembly 
members present shall vote unless the Assembly, for special 
reasons, permits a member to abstain. 

2.12.210 Mayor's Vote. The Mayor may vote only in the 
case of a tie. 

2.12.220 Veto. The Mayor may veto any ordinance, 
resolution, motion or other action of the Assembly and may, by 
veto,
strike or reduce items in appropriation ordinances except for 
school board education items. He shall submit to the Assembly
at its next regular meeting a written statement advising of his 
veto and giving his reasons. A veto is overridden by the vote
of two-thirds of the membership of the Assembly. 

2.12.230 Duties of the Clerk at Assembly Meetings. The 
Borough Clerk shall give notice of Borough Assembly meetings, 
shall attend all meetings of the Assembly and keep the journal 
of its proceedings, and shall authenticate by his signature and 
record in full, in a book or file kept for that purpose, all 
ordinances and resolutions duly indexed and open to public 
inspection. In case of the temporary absence of the Clerk, the

close of polls and upon the receipt within the ballot box of all 
ballots timely voted, the ballot box will be personally opened 
by the election judges as specified in § 4.24.110. 


4.24.040  Voting Procedure. 

A. Before being allowed to vote, each voter shall exhibit 
to an election official one form of identification, including 
but not limited to, an official voter registration card,
driver's license, passport, or hunting or fishing license. An 
election official may waive the identification requirement if 
the election official knows the identity of the voter. The 
voter shall then write his name and residence and mailing 
addresses on the first available line of the original register.  
If any election official believes the voter is not qualified to 
vote, he shall immediately challenge the voter in accordance 
with Section 4.24.080. 

B. When a voter has qualified to vote, the election 
official shall give the voter an official ballot. The voter 
shall retire alone to a voting booth and without undue delay, 
prepare his ballot by marking the appropriate boxes opposite the 
names of the candidates of his choice, whether printed on the 
ballot or written in by him on the blank lines provided for that
purpose, and the appropriate boxes for questions and 
propositions. Before leaving the voting booth, the voter shall 
fold his ballot in a manner displaying the number thereon and 
deliver it to one of the judges or clerks, who shall tear the 
number off and deposit the ballot in the ballot box if the 
ballot bears the same number as the ballot given to the voter by 
the judges and clerks.

C. A voter who by accident or mistake mutilates or spoils 
his ballot shall, upon returning the same to the judges and 
clerks, be given another.

D. A qualified voter who cannot see, read or is otherwise 
incapable of marking his ballot may request an election official
to assist him. If the election official is requested, he shall
assist the voter. 


4.24.050  Marking of Ballots by Voters. 

A. A voter shall mark his ballot only by the use of 
crossmark, "X" marks, diagonal, horizontal or vertical marks, 
solid marks, stars, circles, asterisks, checks, or plus signs 
that are clearly spaced within the square opposite the name of 
the candidate or proposition or question desired to be 
designated. 

B. A failure to properly mark a ballot does not in itself 
invalidate the entire ballot. 

1. 
If a voter marks fewer names than there are 
persons to be elected to the office, a vote shall be counted for 
each candidate properly marked.


2. 
If a voter marks more names than there are 
persons to be elected to the office, the votes for candidates 
for that office shall not be counted. 


3. 
A voter's mark shall be counted only if it is 
substantially inside the square provided, or touching the square
so as to indicate clearly that the voter intended the particular 
square to be designated.


4. 
Improper marks on a ballot shall not be counted
and shall not invalidate proper marks on the ballot.


5. 
An erasure or correction invalidates only that 
section of the ballot in which it appears.


6. 
Write-in votes are not invalidated by writing in
the name of a candidate whose name is already printed on the 
ballot, unless the election board determines, on the basis of 
other evidence, that the ballot was so marked for the purpose of
identifying the ballot.



C. Stickers bearing a candidate's name may be affixed to 
the ballot in lieu of writing in a candidate's name.

D. No voter may leave the polling place with the official 
ballot that he received to mark. 

4.24.060 Exhibiting Marked Ballots Prohibited. No voter 
may exhibit a ballot to an election official or any other person
so as to enable any person to ascertain how the voter marked the 
ballot, except as provided in Section 4.24.040(d). 


4.24.070 Identification of Ballots Prohibited. While the 

polls are open, no election official may open any ballot 
received from a voter, mark a ballot by folding or otherwise so
as to be able to recognize it, or otherwise attempt to learn how 
a voter marked a ballot, or allow the same to be done by another
person. 

4.24.080 Challenging of Voters of Suspect Qualification.  
Every election judge and election clerk shall challenge, and 
every watcher and any other person qualified to vote in the 
precinct may challenge a person attempting to vote if the 
challenger has good reason to suspect that the challenged 
person is not qualified to vote. All challenges regarding a 
person's qualification to vote shall be made in writing setting
out the reason for the challenge. A challenged person before 

voting shall subscribe to an oath and affidavit provided by the 
Borough Clerk attesting to the fact that in each particular the 
person meets all the qualifications of a voter, is not 
disqualified, and has not voted at the same election. The 
challenged person shall also state the place from which he came
immediately before living in the precinct where he is now 
offering to vote and the length of time of residency in the 
former place. After the challenged person has taken the oath 
and signed the affidavit, the person may vote. If the 
challenged person refuses to take the oath or sign the 
affidavit, the person may not vote. 

4.24.090 Questioning a Voter's Ballot. If his polling 
place is in question, a voter shall be allowed to vote, and 
election officials shall consider the ballot as a challenged 
ballot. 

4.24.100 Disposition of Challenged Ballots. A voter who 
casts a challenged ballot shall vote the ballot in the same 
manner as prescribed for other voters. After voting, the voter 
shall insert the ballot into a small blank envelope and seal it.
This envelope shall be placed in the signed oath and affidavit 
envelope. The oath and affidavit envelope shall be sealed by an 
election official and inserted into a large envelope. The 
envelope will be delivered to the Borough Clerk, who will 
present it to the canvass committee and assist in determining 
the merits of the challenge. 


4.24.110  Ballots --Counting and Tallying.  

A. Immediately after the polls close and the last vote 
has been cast, the election judges shall immediately open the 
ballot boxes in full view of all persons present and count the
votes cast in accordance with subsections B and C.  

B. The ballots will be counted to determine whether the 
total number of ballots is equal to the total number of persons
who voted as indicated in the original register. If the number 
of ballots drawn from the ballot box does not match the number 
of ballots indicated by the register to have been cast in the
precinct, the ballots shall be recounted until the election 
board finds that there is a discrepancy or that the number of
ballots cast matches the number of ballots indicated by the 
register. If a discrepancy is determined to exist, it shall be
explained in detail in writing on the tally paper or papers and
such explanation shall be signed by the judges.

C. Ballots are counted by hand by the election judges. 
The counting of the ballots shall be public and the election 

board shall allow any person to see the ballots when the votes
are counted. However, the chairman of the election board shall 
not permit anyone present to interfere in any way or to distract
the appointed election officials from their duties, and no one 
other than appointed election officials may handle the ballots.
The judges shall remove the ballots from the ballot box one by
one, and tally the number of votes for each candidate and for or 
against each proposition or question. The ballots shall be 
inspected for disqualifying marks or defects. No person 
handling the ballots may remove a ballot from the immediate 
vicinity. The election judges shall cause the vote tally to be
continued without adjournment until the court is complete. 


4.24.120 Defective and Unused Ballots. If a voter shall 

mark more names than there are persons to be elected to any 
office, or if, for any reason, it is impossible to determine 
from his ballot any voter's choice for any office to be filled
or proposition or question to be answered, the ballot shall not 
be counted as to that office or issue. A failure to properly
mark a ballot as to one or more candidates or issues shall not 
invalidate the entire ballot. No ballot shall be rejected if 
the election board can determine from an inspection of the 
ballot the person for whom the voter intended to vote and the
office intended to be designated by the voter or the answer to
the propositions or questions presented. Ballots not counted 
shall be marked "Defective" on the back thereof, and ballots to 
which objection has been made shall be marked "Objected To" on 
the back thereof. An explanation of the defect or objection 
shall be written on the back of the ballot and signed by the 
chairman. All such ballots shall be enclosed in an envelope
marked on the outside with a description of its contents. All 
defective or objected to ballots, all ballots not voted, and all 
ballots mutilated or spoiled by voters shall be returned by the 
judges to the Borough Clerk, who shall give a receipt therefore 
and keep a record of the number and character of ballots 
returned to him, indicating when and by which judge each was 
returned. 

4.24.130 Election Certificate. When the count of votes is 
completed, the election board shall make a certificate of the 
results. The certificate shall state the number of votes cast 
for each candidate, for and against each proposition, yes or no 
on each question and any additional information prescribed by 
the Clerk. The register and the tally of votes will be attached
to the certificate and the certificate will be signed by the 
election judges. The registration list, original register,

from day to day for cause but not exceeding three days in total. 


4.28.020  Canvassing Procedure.  

A. The canvass of all absentee and challenged ballots 
will be made in public by opening the returns, and announcing 
the results thereof, in front of whomever may be present.

B. Absentee ballots shall be counted by the Borough Clerk 
and two or more assistants appointed by him in the following 
manner: All ballot envelopes shall be removed from return 
envelopes, and placed in a ballot box. The return envelopes 
shall be delivered to the Borough Clerk. The absentee ballots 
shall then one by one be removed from the ballot box, taken out 
of the ballot envelopes and counted in the same manner in which
ballots cast at the polls are counted by an election board.

C. The canvass shall include a review and comparison of 
the tallies of paper ballots with the precinct election 
certificates to correct any mathematical error in the count of 
paper ballots.

certify in writing to the state canvass board any changes 
resulting from the count.

committee will deliver the challenged ballots to the Assembly
and submit a report of their findings. The Assembly may, by a 
majority vote of those present, affirm or deny a challenge. If 
a challenge is upheld, the ballot challenged will not be opened 
and counted, but will be stored and preserved as other ballots.
If a challenge is denied, the ballot will be counted with the
absentee ballots. The Borough Clerk will notify a voter whose 
ballot is not counted that the challenge was upheld.

tee, and then review its own findings in the manner outlined in
subsection (A).

for debt service. No appropriation may be reduced by more than
the amount of the unencumbered balance. 

F. Notwithstanding paragraph A of this subsection, the 
Assembly may, by ordinance, require payment of funds from

6.16.010  Scope of Budget. 

A. The budget shall be a complete financial plan for all
operations of the Borough, showing all reserves, estimated 
revenues from all sources, and proposed expenditures for all 
purposes.

B. The budget shall include a comparative statement of 
actual expenditures and actual revenues for the preceding fiscal
years and estimated expenditures and anticipated revenues for 
the current fiscal year.

C. Proposed expenditures shall not exceed total 
anticipated revenues and reserves. 

6.16.020 Anticipated Revenues. Anticipated revenues shall 
be composed of "taxes," "licenses and permits," 
"intergovernmental revenue," "charges for services," "fines and 
forfeits," "miscellaneous revenue," "cash reserves," and "rents 
and leases." 

6.16.030 Anticipated Revenues Compared with Other Years.
In the comparative statement, in parallel columns opposite the
items of anticipated revenues, there shall be listed the amount 
of each such item actually received in the preceding fiscal 
year, the amount of each item of the budget of the current year,
and the amount actually received during the first six months of 
the current year. 

6.16.040 Year-end Surpluses. Unencumbered year-end 
surpluses available for appropriation shall be restricted to 
available surplus, which is defined for purposes of this title 
as the amount by which cash plus accrued net receivables exceeds 
current liabilities at the beginning of the current fiscal year.
Net receivables for particular funds shall be determined as 
provided by the National Committee on Governmental Accounting in
the current edition of their manual on Governmental Accounting, 
Auditing and Financial Reporting. 

6.16.050 Anticipated Surplus From Borough Utility or Other 
Public Service Enterprise. The anticipated revenues and 
proposed expenditures of each utility or other public service 
enterprise owned or operated by the Borough shall be stated in a 
separate section of the budget, each bearing the name of the 
utility or enterprise. Any anticipated year-end surpluses, if
legally available for general purposes, anticipated payment in
lieu of taxes (utilizing the same evaluation basis which would 
be used if privately owned, times the applicable millage rate), 
and reimbursements for central services rendered shall be stated 
as an item of revenue in the general fund budget. However, no 
payment for general purposes or payment in lieu of taxes may be
made if the utility or enterprise is not self-liquidating in 
regard to debt. 

6.16.060 Revenues --Measures of Estimates. No revenue 
from any source, except year-end surpluses from publicly owned
enterprises, shall be included as an anticipated revenue in the
budget in an amount in excess of the average of the amount 
actually realized in cash from the same source in the next 
preceding fiscal year, and that actually realized in the first 
six months of the current fiscal year plus that anticipated for 
the remaining portion of the fiscal year, estimated as 
accurately as may be, unless the Borough Manager shall determine 
that the facts clearly warrant the expectation that such excess 
amount will actually be realized in cash during the budget year
and the budget message explains this determination. 

6.16.070 Revenues From New Source. No revenue from a new 
source not previously stated in the budget shall be included 
unless the Borough Manager shall determine that the facts 
clearly warrant the expectation that such revenue will be 
actually realized in cash during the budget year in the amount 
stated and the budget message explains such determination. If 
the new revenue is to be received from the state or a federal 
agency, the anticipated amount shall not exceed the amount which 
an appropriate officer of the state or federal agency shall 
declare in writing to be the amount which may reasonably be 
anticipated in the budget year. 

6.16.080 Revenue From Property Tax. Anticipated revenue 
from the property tax shall separately include the estimated 
revenue from delinquent property taxes and the estimated revenue 
from the levy due in the budget year. Each item of revenue 
shall be the anticipated actual cash receipts from these 
sources, estimated as prescribed in Sections 6.16.090 and 


6.16.100 of this Chapter. 

6.16.090 Revenue From Delinquent Property Taxes --Measure 
of Estimates. The estimate of the amount of delinquent property
taxes expected to be collected during the budget year shall be a
proportion of the delinquent property taxes expected to be 
outstanding on the first day of the budget year, said proportion 
to not exceed the average of (1) the percentage of delinquent
property taxes outstanding at the beginning of the next 
preceding fiscal year which was actually realized in cash during
that year; and (2) the percentage of the delinquent taxes 
outstanding at the beginning of the current fiscal year which 
was actually realized in cash for the first six months plus that 
to be received in the remainder of the year estimated as 
accurately as may be. 

6.16.100 Revenue From Current Property Tax --Measure of 
Estimates. The item included in the budget as anticipated 
revenue from the property tax levied and payable in the budget 
year shall be a proportion of the levy, not in excess of the 
average of (1) the percentage of the levy of the next preceding
fiscal year which was actually realized in cash during that year
and (2) the percentage of the levy of the current fiscal year
which was actually realized in cash for the first six months 
plus that to be received in the remainder of the current year
estimated as accurately as may be. There shall be set forth 
with the estimate of revenue to be received from the tax levy 

applicable to the budget year, the total amount of taxes 
required to be levied to produce this estimate and the amount of
the reserve required for taxes uncollected within the year of
levy. 

6.16.110 Proposed Expenditures. Proposed expenditures 
shall be itemized. Separate provisions shall be included in the 
budget for, but not necessarily limited to, the following items:

A. Interest, amortization of principal and redemption 
charges on the public debt for which the faith and credit of the 
Borough is pledged;

B. Other expenditures required by statute; 

C. The payment of all judgments, unless the Borough is

made actual provision for payment under such authorization;

D. The cash deficit of the current year, to the extent 
provided by Section 6.16.120;

E. The amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of 
all tax anticipation notes which it is estimated will be 
outstanding on the first day of the budget year;

F. The amount equal to the aggregate of all discounts, 
cancellations, remissions, abatements and refunds of taxes that 
have been made during the current fiscal year, provided that
where applicable this shall be set out as a specific item of
reduction in the revenue projections;

G. The amount equal to the aggregate of all special 
revenue notes or warrants, which it is estimated will be 
outstanding at the end of the current year in anticipation of 
the collection of revenues other than the property tax;

H. The amount equal to the aggregate of all emergency
notes or warrants, which it is estimated will be outstanding at 
the end of the current year;

I. The amount equal to the deficit arising from the 
operations of utility or other public service enterprises during
the next preceding fiscal year, separately stated for each 
utility or other public service enterprise which appears in a 
separate section of the budget. However, provision shall be 
made for increased service charges or increased contributions 
from taxes in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficit;

J. Administration, operation and maintenance costs of 
each office, department or agency of the Borough;

K. Assembly's budgetary reserve in an amount not more 
than three percent of the total amount stated pursuant to 
subsection (J) of this section; 

L. Expenditures proposed for capital projects, including 
provisions for down payments on capital projects to be 
transferred to the capital projects fund; and

M. A provision for appropriations to a reserve for 
capital outlay account, to be maintained in the capital projects
fund for all projects scheduled for pay-as-you-go or for a 
partial down payment as provided for in Section 6.16.140. 


6.16.120 Provision for Cash Deficit of Current Year.  

Under the caption "Cash Deficit of Current Year," there shall be 
included an amount at least equal to the amount by which the 
aggregate of expenditures and encumbrances in the current year 
will exceed the aggregate of cash receipts in the current year, 
unless or to the extent that such deficit will have been 
provided for from available reserves of the various service 
areas or areawide accounts or through the issuance of notes, 
warrants or other interim or temporary financing needs for which
appropriation is made under Section 6.16.110(E) and (H). 

6.16.130 Proposed Expenditures Compared With Other Years. 
In parallel columns, opposite the items of proposed 
expenditures, there shall be placed the amount of each such 
item actually expended in the preceding fiscal year, the amount 
budgeted for the current fiscal year and the amount actually
expended for the first six months of the current fiscal year. 


6.16.140  Down Payments on Capital Projects.  

A. The budget shall separately state a sum which is not 
less than five percent of the amount of expenditures from bond
proceeds for each capital project during the budget year; said
sum shall be a "down payment" on projects and appropriated from
the reserve for capital outlay account if accumulated under the 
provision of Section 6.16.150, and/or otherwise appropriated
from the applicable fund to the extent the down payment was not
provided in prior operating budgets. Each capital project shall 
be individually listed, along with the amount expected to be 
authorized for bonds to finance the project. For the purpose of 
the down payments, all street improvements expected to be 
financed in part by the issuing of bonds during the budget year
may be considered a single project, as may all proposed 
extensions of the water and sewer systems.

B. An appropriation for a down payment shall not be 
required before the issuance of bonds to finance any capital 
expenditure which is the result of fire, flood or other 
disaster, is for a Borough owned or operated utility or other 
public service enterprise, or is to be met, in part, in cash, 

labor or materials by any agency of the government of the United
States of America or of this state. 

C. A down payment may be accumulated in a reserve for 
capital outlay account in the capital projects fund, as well as 
the enterprise funds, annually based upon the long range capital 
improvement program and budget. 


6.16.150  Reserve for Capital Outlay Account. 

A. A reserve for capital outlay accounts will be 
established within the capital projects fund and each utility 
and other enterprise fund.

B. Based upon the six-year program submitted per Section
6.12.040, provisions will be made to accumulate annually the 
minimum down payment for each project in the current budget to 
be expended from bond proceeds. In addition, provisions will be 
made to annually appropriate funds to this account for projects
outlined in the six-year program. 

6.16.160 Budget Summary. At the beginning of the budget, 
there shall appear a summary of the budget. The budget summary 
need not be itemized further than by principal sources of 
anticipated revenue, stating separately the amounts to be raised
by property tax, and by departments and kinds of expenditures in 
such a manner as to present to the taxpayers a simple and clear 
summary of the detailed estimates of the budget.

within the limit of the money available.



B. If the lowest and best bid exceeds the budgeted amount 
and the Borough Assembly does not make additional funds 
available, the proposed contract for purchase or sale or for 
services or for a construction project shall be reduced in scope 
sufficiently to bring the estimate of cost within the fund 
available. 

6.24.150 Bids --Waiver of Irregularities. The Borough 
Assembly shall have the authority to waive any and all 
irregularities on any or all bids.

A. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible 
bidder. In determining the "lowest responsible bidder," in 
addition to price, there shall be considered:

1. 
The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to 
perform the contract;


2. 
Whether the bidder can perform the contract 
within the time specified, without delay or interference;


3. 
The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, 
experience and efficiency of the bidder;



4. The quality of performance of previous contracts;

preference may be given to local bidders.



B. When the award is given to other than the lowest 
bidder, a full and complete written statement of the reasons 
therefor shall be delivered to the unsuccessful low bidder or 
bidders and filed with the other papers relating to the 

transaction. The minutes of the Assembly relating to the matter 
may be used as the required written statement. 

6.24.170 Exceptions to Competitive Sealed Bidding and 
Submission of Bid. The restrictions and provisions of this 
Chapter requiring competitive bidding shall not apply:

A. To contracts involving the obtaining of professional
or specialized services, such as, but not limited to, services
rendered by architects, attorneys, engineers and other 
specialized consultants;

B. Where calling for bids on a competitive basis is 
unavailing or impossible, including, but not limited to,
situations where rates are set by statute or ordinance or where 
like items are traded in, or where used items are being 
purchased;

C. Where the Borough's requirements can be met solely by 
an article or process obtainable only from a single source;

D. To placement of insurance coverage; 

E. When public work is performed by the Borough with its 
own employees;

contract with a bidder for the same supplies or services such
bidder is providing another Alaskan local government, the state 
of Alaska, or the United States, where such supplies or services
are being provided the other governmental unit on the basis of 
formal bids submitted, and where the Borough contract is on 
substantially the same terms as those bid; or to contract with
or through such other governmental unit so that the benefit of 
the responsible bid accrues to the Borough;

G. When competitive procedure has been followed, but no
bids or quotations are received. In such a case, the purchasing
agent may proceed to have the services performed or the supplies
purchased without further competitive bidding;

H. To supplies, materials, equipment or contractual 
services purchased from another unit of government at a price
deemed below that obtainable from private dealers, including war
surplus; and

I. To contractual services purchased from a public 
utility corporation at a price or rate determined by state or 
other government authority.

proposals pursuant to Section 6.24.175 of this Chapter, when the
conditions for use of competitive sealed proposals under that 
section are met. 

K. To purchases of fuel, and related container, 
transportation and delivery services, by the Boroughs 

electrical utility, provided that the purchasing agent 
ascertains, through reasonably sufficient and commercially
practicable efforts, that the fuel is being purchased by the 
Borough at the lowest cost available to the Borough taking into
account all related expenses. Purchases made under this 
paragraph do not require Assembly approval under section 


6.24.070 of this Chapter. 

6.24.175  Competitive Sealed Proposals. 

A. When the Borough Purchasing Agent determines in 
writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not 
practicable or not advantageous to the Borough, a contract may 
be entered into by competitive sealed proposals.

B. When the purchasing agent determines that it is 
advantageous to the Borough, the purchasing agent may issue a 
request for proposals requesting the submission of offers to 
provide construction in accordance with a design provided by the
offeror. The request for proposals shall require that each 
proposal submitted contain a single price that includes the 
design/build.

C. A request for competitive sealed proposals must 
contain the date, time, and place for delivering proposals, a 
specific description of the supplies, construction, services, or 
professional services to be provided under the contract, and the
terms under which the supplies, construction, services, or 
professional services are to be provided. The request must 
require the offeror, no later than five working days after the 
proposal that is the most advantageous to the Borough is 
identified, to list subcontractors the offeror proposes to use
in the performance of the contract. The list must include the 
name and location of the place of business for each 
subcontractor, the work to be subcontracted to each 
subcontractor, and evidence of the subcontractor's valid Alaska
business license. An offeror for a construction contract shall 
also submit evidence of the offeror's registration under AS 

08.18 and evidence of registration for each listed 
subcontractor. 

D. A request for proposals must contain that information 
necessary for an offeror to submit a proposal, or contain 
references to any information that cannot reasonably be included 
with the request. The request must provide a description of the 
factors that will be considered by the purchasing agent when 
evaluating the proposals received, including the relative 
importance of price and other evaluation factors.

E. Notice of a request for proposals shall be given in 
accordance with procedures under Section 6.24.100. The 

purchasing agent may use additional means considered appropriate 
to notify prospective offerors of the intent to enter into a 
contract through competitive sealed proposals.

F. If a subcontractor on an offeror's list did not have a 
valid Alaska business license and a valid certificate of 
registration under AS 08.18 at the time the proposal was opened, 
the offeror may not use the subcontractor in the performance of 
the contract, and shall replace the subcontractor with a 
subcontractor who had a valid Alaska business license and a 
valid certificate of registration under AS 08.18 at the time the 
proposal was opened.

An offeror may replace a listed subcontractor if the 
subcontractor 

(1) 
fails to comply with AS 08.18; 


(2) 
files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent; 



(3) 
fails to execute a contract with the offeror 
involving performance of the work for which the subcontractor 
was listed and the offeror acted in good faith; 


(4) fails to obtain required bonding; 


(5) 
fails to obtain insurance acceptable to the 
Borough; 


(6) 
fails to perform the contract with the offeror 
involving work for which the subcontractor was listed; 


(7) 
must be substituted in order for the offeror to 
satisfy required state and federal affirmative action 
requirements; 


(8) 
refuses to agree or abide with the offeror's 
labor agreement; or 


(9) 
is determined by the purchasing agent not to be a 
responsible subcontractor.


G. 
A bidder who attempts to circumvent the requirements of 
subsection (C) hereof by listing as a subcontractor another 
contractor who, in turn, sublets the majority of the work 
required under the contract violates this section.


H. 
If a contract is awarded to an offeror who violates 
the requirements of subsection (C) hereof, the purchase agent 
may 


(1) cancel the contract; or 


(2) 
after notice and a hearing, assess a penalty on
the offeror in an amount that does not exceed 10 percent of the 
value of the subcontract at issue. 


I. 
The offeror must have a valid Alaska business license 
at the time its proposal was opened.


J. 
The purchasing agent shall open proposals so as to 
avoid disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the 
process of negotiation. The proposals are open for public 



inspection after the notice of intent to award a contract is 
issued. To the extent that the offeror designates and the 
purchasing agent concurs, trade secrets and other proprietary 
data contained in the proposal documents are confidential.

K. Discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors
who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of 
being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to 
assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the 
solicitation requirements. Offerors reasonably susceptible of 
being selected for award shall be accorded fair and equal 
treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and 
revision of proposals, and revisions may be permitted after 
submissions and before the award of the contract for the purpose 
of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions,
the purchasing agent may not disclose information derived from 
proposals submitted by competing offerors.

L. The purchasing agent or, if the contract is for more 
than fifteen thousand dollars, the Assembly, shall award a 
contract under competitive sealed proposals to the responsible 
and responsive offeror whose proposal is determined in writing
to be the most advantageous to the Borough taking into 
consideration price and the evaluation factors set out in the
request for proposals. In determining whether a proposal is 
advantageous to the Borough, the purchasing agent or Assembly
shall take into account whether the offeror is a local bidder 
who has maintained a place of business within the Borough for a
period of six months preceding the date of the request for 
proposals. For the purpose of evaluating cost factors, the 
proposed costs of an offeror who qualifies as a local bidder 
shall be reduced by five percent (5%). Factors and criteria 
other than those set forth in the request for proposals may not
be used in the evaluation. The contract file must contain the 
basis on which the award is made. The minutes of the Assembly
relating to the award decision may be used as the basis for the 
award. 

M. The purchasing agent or, if the contract is for more
than fifteen thousand dollars, the Assembly, may either make an 
award or reject all proposals and resolicit proposals.

N. A contract awarded under competitive sealed proposals 
must contain 

(1) 
the amount of the contract stated on its first 
page; 


(2) 
the date for the supplies to be delivered or the 
dates for construction, services, or professional services to 
begin and be completed; and 


(3) 
a description of the supplies, construction, 
services, or professional services to be provided. 




6.24.180 Contracts of Five Thousand Dollars or Less.  

Unless otherwise prohibited by the ordinances of the Borough, 
purchases of materials, supplies, equipment or contractual 
services, where the actual cost is five thousand dollars or 
less, may be made on the open market without competitive 
bidding. 


6.24.190 Contracts Between Five and Fifteen Thousand 

Dollars.  

A. All purchases of supplies, materials, equipment and 
contractual services of a total estimated value of more than 
five thousand dollars and less than fifteen thousand dollars 
shall be made in the open market without newspaper advertisement 
and without observing the procedure prescribed by this title for 
formal purchasing or sale procedures.

B. Open market purchases or sales made under this section
shall, whenever possible, be based on at least three competitive 
bids and shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder in 
accordance with the standards set forth in Sections 6.24.090 
through 6.24.170 of this Chapter.

C. The purchasing agent may solicit either oral or 
written bids for open market purchases or sales.

D. The purchasing agent shall keep a record of all open
market bids submitted in competition thereon, and such records
shall also be open to public inspection. 


6.24.200  Insurance Policies.  

A. The Borough shall purchase policies of insurance by
the open market procedures provided in this Chapter.

B. Open market procedures may not be required for a 
policy which:

1. Has an annual premium or charge of less than two
hundred fifty dollars;

2. 
Provides liability coverage for a single event; 


3. 
Is for property title insurance; or 


4. 
Has its premium or charge fixed by state statute. 



C. Open market procedures may not be required for a 
change in an insurance policy in effect, or to acquire policies
supplemental to an existing policy if the policies in effect 
cannot be changed, provided that the change or supplemental 
policies are approved by the Assembly. 

6.24.210 Subdivision of Specifications Prohibited. No 
project or contract specifications shall be subdivided to avoid 
the requirements of this title. This provision shall not 
preclude the use of alternate deductible items. 

6.24.220 Emergency Contracts. Whenever, because of any 
emergency, it is deemed necessary and in the public interest by 
the Mayor to enter into any contract without following the 
competitive bidding procedures as may be required by this title,
the Mayor shall authorize such emergency contract if the 
estimated sum involved is less than fifteen thousand dollars. 
If the estimated contract sum involved is greater than fifteen 
thousand dollars, the Mayor shall refer any proposed emergency
contract to the Assembly for its approval and authorization to 
waive the competitive bidding procedures. 

6.24.230 Encumbrance of Funds. Except in cases of 
emergency declared by the Mayor or the Assembly as provided in 
this chapter, no contract or any change order to an existing 
contract shall be authorized unless there is a sufficient 
unencumbered balance in the budget appropriation of the using 
agency or sufficient bond funds available, in excess of actual 
expenditures or commitments, to cover such contract or change 
order. 

6.24.240 State Procurement Code. If the bidding 
procedures set out in the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30.005 
et seq.) are applicable to any contract to which the Borough is
a party, then those procedures shall govern in the case of any
inconsistency between those procedures and the procedures set 
out in this Code.

6.28.040  Required Exemptions.  

A. The following property is exempt from general 
taxation: 

1.

Borough; 


2. 
Household furniture and personal effects of 
members of a household;


3. 
Property used exclusively for nonprofit 
religious, charitable, cemetery, hospital or educational

5. Money on deposit; 

6. The real property of certain residents of the 
state to the extent and subject to the conditions provided in 

(E) of this section;

amended. 


8.

extent of that interest. 


9. 
Natural resources in place including coal, ore 
bodies, mineral deposits, and other proven and unproven deposits 
of valuable materials laid down by natural processes,

C. Property required in (A) (3) or (4) of this section

solely from use of the property by nonprofit religious, 
charitable, hospital, or educational groups. If used by
nonprofit educational groups, the property is exempt only if 
used exclusively for classroom space.

D. Laws exempting certain property from execution under 
the Code of Civil Procedure (AS 09) do not exempt the property 
from taxes levied and collected by the Borough.

E. The real property owned and occupied as the primary 
residence and permanent place of abode by a (1) resident 65 
years of age or older; (2) disabled veteran; or (3) resident at
least 60 years old who is the widow or widower of a person who
qualified for an exemption under (1) or (2) of this subsection, 
is exempt from taxation on the first $150,000 of the assessed
value of the real property. The Borough may, in a case of 
hardship, provide for exemption beyond the first $150,000 of 
assessed value in accordance with regulations of the Department 
of Community and Regional Affairs. Only one exemption may be 
granted for the same property and, if two or more persons are
eligible for an exemption for the same property, the parties 
shall decide between or among themselves who is to receive the 
benefit of the exemption. Real property may not be exempted
under this subsection if the assessor determines, after notice
and hearing to the parties, that the property was conveyed to 
the applicant primarily for the purpose of obtaining the 
exemption. The determination of the assessor may be appealed
under AS 44.62.560-44.62.570. 

F. An exemption may not be granted under (E) of this 
section except upon written application for the exemption on a 
form approved by the state assessor for use by local assessors.  
The claimant must file the application no later than January 15, 
or a date provided by ordinance that is not later than March 31, 
of the assessment year for which the exemption is sought. The 
Assembly for good cause shown may waive during a year the 
claimant's failure to make timely application for exemption for 
that year and authorize the assessor to accept the application 
as if timely filed. The claimant must file a separate
application for each assessment year in which the exemption is 
sought. If an application is filed within the required time and 
is approved by the assessor, the assessor shall allow an 

exemption in accordance with the provisions of this section. If 
a failure to file by January 15, or a date provided by ordinance 
that is not later than March 31, of the assessment year has been
waived as provided in this subsection and the application for 
exemption is approved, the amount of tax that the claimant has 
already paid for the assessment year for the property exempted
shall be refunded to the claimant. The assessor shall require 
proof in the form the assessor considers necessary of the right 
to and amount of an exemption claimed under (E) of this section,
and shall require a disabled veteran claiming an exemption under 

(E) 
of this section to provide evidence of the disability 
rating. The assessor may require proof under this section at 
any time.


G. 
The state shall reimburse the Borough for the real
property tax revenues lost to it by the operation of (E) of this
section. However, reimbursement will be made to the Borough for 
revenue lost to it only to the extent that the loss exceeds an 
exemption that was granted by the Borough, or that on proper 
application by an individual would have been granted under AS 
29.45.050(a). If appropriations are not sufficient to fully 
fund reimbursements under this subsection, the amount available
shall be distributed pro rata among eligible municipalities.


H. Except as provided in (G) of this section, nothing in 


(E) 
-(J) affects similar exemptions from property taxes granted 
by the Borough on September 10, 1972, or prevents the Borough 
from granting similar exemptions by ordinance as provided in AS



29.45.050. 

I. In (E) -(I) of this section.

1. 
"disabled veteran" means a disabled person (a)
separated from the military service of the United States under a 
condition that is not dishonorable who is a resident of the 
state, whose disability was incurred or aggravated in the line
of duty in the military service of the United States, and whose
disability has been rated as 50 percent or more by the branch of 
service in which that person served or by the Veterans' 
Administration; or (b) who served in the Alaska Territorial 
Guard, who is a resident of the state, whose disability was 
incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while serving in the
Alaska Territorial Guard, and whose disability has been rated as
50 percent or more;


2. 
"real property" includes, but is not limited to
mobile homes, whether classified as real or personal property 
for Borough tax purposes.



J. One motor vehicle per household owned by a resident 65 
years of age or older on January 1 of the assessment year is 
exempt either from taxation on its assessed value or from the 

registration tax under AS 28.10.431. An exemption may be 
granted under this subsection only upon written application on a 
form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety.

K. The Department of Community and Regional Affairs shall
adopt regulations to implement the provisions of (g) and (j) of 
AS 29.45.030, which are identical to (G) and (J) of this 
subsection 

L. Two percent of the assessed value of a structure is 
exempt from taxation if the structure contains a fire protection 
system approved under AS 18.70.081, in operating condition, and 
incorporated as a fixture or part of the structure. The 
exemption granted by this subsection is limited to

1. 
an amount equal to two percent of the value of 
the structure based on the assessment for 1981, if the fire
protection system is a fixture of the structure on January 1, 
1981; or 


2. 
an amount equal to two percent of the value of 
the structure based on the assessment as of January 1 of the 
year immediately following the installation of the fire 
protection system if the fire protection system becomes a 
fixture of the structure after January 1, 1981.



M. For the purpose of determining property exempt under
(A)(7) of this section, the following definitions apply to terms
used in 43 U.S.C. 1620(d) unless superseded by applicable 
federal law: 

1. 
"developed" means a purposeful modification of 
the property from its original state that effectuates a 
condition of gainful and productive present use without further 
substantial modification; surveying, construction of roads, 
providing utilities or other similar actions normally considered 
to be component parts of the development process, but that do 
not create the condition described in this paragraph, do not 
constitute a developed state within the meaning of this 
paragraph; developed property, in order to remove the exemption, 
must be developed for purposes other than exploration, and be 
limited to the smallest practicable tract of the property 
actually used in the developed state;


2. 
"exploration" means the examination and 
investigation of undeveloped land to determine the existence of 
subsurface nonrenewable resources;


3. 
"lease" means a grant of primary possession 
entered into for gainful purposes with a determinable fee 
remaining in the hands of the grantor; with respect to a lease
that conveys rights of exploration and development, this 
exemption shall continue with respect to that portion of the
leased tract that is used solely for the purpose of exploration. 



N. If property or an interest in property that is 
determined not to be exempt under (A)(7) of this section reverts 
to an undeveloped state, or if the lease is terminated, the 
exemption shall be granted, subject to the provisions of (A)(7) 
and (M) of this section. 


6.28.050  ANB Hall Tax Exemption.  

A. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority
conferred upon the City and Borough of Yakutat under AS 

29.45.050. 

B. The Alaska Native Brotherhood Hall shall be exempted
from the payment of real property taxes for the year 1979 and

the Hall is located and all buildings, structures, improvements
and fixtures of whatever kind.  

6.28.060 Additional Taxation Upon a Service Area. Any
additional property tax levied upon a service area established
under Chapter 6.30 of this Code shall comply with and be 
governed by the procedures set forth in Chapters 6.28 -6.36 of

Assembly so chooses, it may thereafter establish, by ordinance, 
the service area. 


H. 
The service area may be different in boundaries or 
services than as set forth in the petition. If the description 
of the type or amount of services to be provided, or the 
boundary of the area to be included within the area, is 
different than designated in the petition, another public 
hearing shall be held prior to or in conjunction with the 
ordinance procedure and notice thereof shall be given as 
provided in paragraph F above.

purpose outside of the service area. 

6.30.050 Differential Tax Levied. There shall be a 
differential tax rate levied in each area and that rate shall be 
related to the estimated cost of services provided in that area.

Land itself, whether laid out in lots or 
otherwise;


2.

within the limits of the Borough before February 15. (Assessor 
appointment -See Section 2.36.010.) The listing of all taxable 
property may be made upon permanent separate ledger cards which 
will be the combined assessment roll and tax ledger. Real 
property shall be assessed to the owner of record as shown in
the records of the recorder for the recording district, provided
however, that any other person having an interest in the 
property may be listed on the assessment records with the owner.  
The person in whose name any property is listed as owner thereof
shall be conclusively presumed to be the legal owner of record. 
If the owner of land is unknown, such land may be assessed to 

"unknown owner" or "unknown owners." No assessment shall be 
invalidated by a mistake, omission or error in the name of the
owner of the real property assessed if the property is correctly 
described. 

B. Description of real property. The assessor may list
real property located in a subdivision by lot and block or tract
description, and unsubdivided property according to the land 
office section and township survey description, by describing 
the boundaries of the property, by reference to the book and 
page of the records of the recorder where the description may be
found, by tax lot number referring to a public record of 
descriptions of real property kept by the assessor, or by any 
other description capable of being made certain. Initial 
letters, abbreviations, fractions and exponents to designate the 
township, range, section or part of a section, or the number of
a lot or block or part of a lot or block, or a distance, course,
bearing or direction may be used in a description of real 
property. 

1. 
For purposes of investigation, the assessor or 
his agent may enter any premises during reasonable hours and 
examine property on the premises. He may examine all property 
records involved. A person shall, upon request, furnish to the 
assessor or his agent every facility and assistance for the 
purposes of investigation. If refused entry or production of 
records, the assessor may seek a court order to compel same.


2. 
An assessor may examine a person on oath. Upon
request, the person shall present himself for examination by the 
assessor. 



C. Content of assessment roll. The assessor shall 
prepare an annual assessment roll in duplicate. The roll shall 
contain: 

1. 
The names and last known addresses of all persons
with property subject to assessment and taxation;

3. 
The assessed value, quantity or amount of all 
taxable property.



D. Corrections by assessor. The assessor may correct any 
error or supply any omission made in the preparation of the 
assessment roll at any time before the sitting of the board of
equalization.

held by the board of equalization are concluded, the assessor
shall complete the annual assessment roll, which shall be based 
on values as of the January first immediately preceding, and he 
shall certify the same. 

F. Supplementary assessment rolls. Supplementary 
assessment rolls shall be prepared and certified as may be 
necessary or expedient. All the duties imposed upon the 
assessor with respect to the annual assessment roll and all 
provisions of this title relating to assessment rolls shall, so 
far as applicable, apply to supplementary assessment rolls.

G. Entry of changes by assessor. The assessor shall 
enter changes upon his records, when such changes are authorized 
and approved by the board and certified to by the finance 
director, and no assessed valuations shall thereafter be 
changed.

H. Delivery of assessment roll to Assembly. When the 
final assessment records have been completed by the assessor as
herein provided, the assessor shall deliver to the Assembly a
statement of the total assessed valuation of all real and 
personal property within the Borough. 

6.32.030 Full and True Value. The assessor shall assess 
property at its full and true value as of January first of the 
assessment year, except as provided in AS 29.45.060, 29.45.110, 
and 29.45.230. The full and true value is the estimated price
that the property would bring in an open market and under the
then prevailing market conditions in a sale between a willing
seller and a willing buyer both conversant with the property and 
with prevailing general price levels. 

6.32.040 Assessment for Certain Properties. Farm or 
agricultural lands shall be assessed as provided in AS

affected by a natural disaster shall be made in accordance with
AS 29.45.230. 


6.32.050  Assessment Notice.  

A. Notice mailed to property owners. On or before 
February 28, the assessor shall give to each person named in the
assessment roll a notice of assessment, showing the assessed 
value of the person's property. Sufficient assessment notice is 
given if mailed by first class mail addressed to, or delivered 
at, the person's address as last known to the assessor, at least
thirty days before the equalization hearings. If the address is 
not known to the assessor, the notice may be addressed to the
person at the post office nearest the property. Notice is 
effective on the date of mailing or delivery.

B. Form of Notice. The notice shall show the assessed 
value of each tract assessed. On each assessment notice shall

shall advise the assessor of errors or omissions in the 
assessment of the person's property. The assessor may correct 
errors or omissions in the roll before the board of equalization
hearing. If errors found in the preparation of the assessment 
roll are adjusted, the assessor shall mail a corrected notice 
allowing 30 days for appeal to the Board of Equalization. 


6.32.060  Board of Equalization.  

A. The Assembly shall sit as a Board of Equalization.  
The purpose of the board of equalization is to examine the 
assessment roll, to equalize and revise the assessment for the 
current year where the board considers it necessary and to hear
complaints and protests on the part of taxpayers or owners of 
property assessed. The date on which the Assembly shall sit as 
a board of equalization shall be the third Thursday in April 
unless otherwise changed by resolution. The board shall adjourn
over and continue its sessions as business requires.

B. Duties and powers of board. The Assembly sitting as a 
board of equalization shall have the full power, and it shall be
the duty of the board:

1. 
To raise or lower the valuation of any property, 
which may be by them deemed unequally or unfairly assessed or 
otherwise in error;


2. 
To add to the assessment list any and all real
property which they may find to have been unfairly omitted from
such list: 



a. 
To place a fair, just and correct valuation 
thereon; and 


b. 
To assess the same, and equalize such assess 
ment. 



Such assessment and equalization of the board shall have 
the same effect as though such property had been originally 
assessed by the duly appointed assessor.

C. Board to send additional notices. If it appears to
the board of equalization that there are overcharges, errors or 
invalidities in the assessment roll, or in any of the 
proceedings leading up to or after the preparation of the roll, 

and there is no appeal before the board, or if the name of a
person is ordered by the board to be entered on the assessment
roll by way of addition or substitution for the purpose of 
assessment, the board shall require the assessor to mail notice 
of assessment or corrected assessment, to that person, giving 
him at least thirty days from the date of the mailing within 
which to appeal to the board against the assessment.

D. Delegation of authority as board of equalization. The 
Assembly may delegate its authority as the board of equalization
to one or more boards appointed by it. An appointed board may
be composed of not less than three persons, who may be members
of the Assembly, Borough residents, or a combination thereof. 
The Assembly shall by ordinance establish the qualifications for
membership. 

6.32.070 Assembly Clerk Ex Officio Clerk of Board. The 
Clerk of the Assembly shall be ex officio Clerk of the Board of 
Equalization and shall record in the minutes of the meeting all 
proceedings before the Board, the names of all persons
protesting assessments, and all changes, revisions, corrections 
and orders relating to claims or adjustments. Within three days 
following the final hearings of the Board, the Clerk shall 
transmit to the assessor all changes, corrections, revisions or 
orders authorized and approved by the board and shall certify
that the changes, corrections, revisions or orders are as 
approved by the board of equalization. 


6.32.080  Appeal to Board of Equalization. 

A. Any person whose name appears on the assessment roll
or the agents or assigns of that person may appeal to the board 
for relief from an alleged error in valuation, overcharge, 
omission or neglect of the assessor not adjusted by the assessor
to the taxpayer's satisfaction.

B. The appellant shall, within thirty days after the date
of mailing of notice of assessment, submit to the assessor a 
written appeal specifying the grounds for appeal. If notice of 
appeal is not given within that period, the right of appeal 
shall cease as to any matter within the jurisdiction of the 
board, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the board that
the taxpayer was unable to appeal within the time so specified.

C. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the assessor 
shall make a record of the same in such form as the Assembly may
direct. The record shall contain all of the information shown 
on the assessment roll with respect to the subject matter of the
appeal, and the assessor shall place the same before the board 
as may be so required. 

D. The assessor shall notify the appellant and any other 
person in respect of whom the appeal is taken of the time and 
place of the hearing, by mail to their respective addresses as 
last known to the assessor. 

E. At the time appointed for the hearing of the appeal, 
or as soon thereafter as the appeal may be heard, the board 
shall hear the assessor, the appellant, other parties to the
appeal and their witnesses, consider the testimony and evidence
adduced, and determine the matters in question on the merits and 
render its decision accordingly.

If any party to whom notice was mailed fails to appear, the
board may proceed with the hearing in his absence.
The burden of proof in all cases shall be upon the party
appealing.

F. The only grounds for adjustment are proof of unequal,
excessive, improper or under valuation based on facts which are
stated in a valid written appeal or proven at the hearing.

G. The board shall certify its actions to the assessor 
within seven days. Except as to supplementary assessments, the 
assessor shall enter the changes and certify the final 
assessment roll by June 1.  

H. An appellant may appeal a determination of the Board 
of Equalization to the superior court, as provided by rules of 
court applicable to appeals from the decisions of administrative
agencies.

I. Entry of decisions. The board shall from time to time 
enter in the appeal record its decision upon appeals brought 
before it and shall certify to the same.

records are completed by the assessor, the assessor shall 
deliver to the Assembly a statement of the total assessed 
valuation of all property in the Borough. The Assembly shall 
annually, by resolution, determine the rate of levy before June 

15. 

6.36.020  Tax Statements. 

A. By July 1, the agent of the Borough designated by the 
Mayor as tax collector of the Borough shall prepare tax 

statements and cause such statements to be mailed to the persons 
listed as the owners on the assessment rolls. The statement 
shall set out the levy, dates when taxes are payable and 
delinquent, and penalties and interest. All of the tax 
statements shall be mailed on the same day. This day shall be 
known as the billing date. The tax collector shall post in
three separate public places in the Borough, a notice that the 
tax statements have been mailed and the date upon which they
were mailed, as well as the date which has been determined to be 
the billing date.

B. All taxes levied or collected shall be calculated, 
levied and collected upon the assessed values entered in the 
assessment roll and certified by the assessor as correct,
subject to the taxpayers' right of appeal and to the corrections 
and amendments made in the rolls. 

C. Certified assessment rolls and foreclosure lists are 
valid and binding on all persons, notwithstanding a defect, 
error, omission, or invalidity in the assessment rolls or 
proceedings pertaining to the assessment roll. 

6.36.030 Due Date --Discount Credit. All taxes become 
due thirty days after the billing date. Those taxes paid in 
full before they become due, that is within thirty days from the
billing date, will be allowed a two percent discount credit on 
the total tax paid. 

6.36.040 Delinquent Date. Those taxes that are not paid
within thirty days after the due date are delinquent. 

6.36.050 Tax Liability and Lien. Real property taxes, 
together with penalty and interest, are a lien upon the property
assessed, and the lien is prior and paramount to all other liens
or encumbrances against the property. 

6.36.060 Rates of Penalty and Interest --Priority for 
Crediting Payments. A penalty of twelve percent of the total 
tax due shall be added to all delinquent taxes, and interest at
the rate of twelve percent per year shall accrue upon all unpaid
taxes, not including the penalty, from the due date until paid
in full. All payments made for taxes, penalty and interest on 
any one piece of property shall be credited first to the 
penalty, then to the interest, then to the past due taxes and
then to the current taxes, in that order. 

6.36.070 Action for Collection of Tax Against Real 
Property. 

A. The Assembly shall enforce delinquent real property 
tax liens by the sale of the property assessed, after 
foreclosure proceedings provided for herein.

B. If the tax on property described in AS 29.45.070 or on 
a taxable interest in tax exempt property is not paid when due,
the Borough may enforce the tax by a personal action against the
delinquent taxpayer, in addition to other remedies available to 
enforce the lien. 

6.36.080 Time of Tax Sale. All real property within the
Borough on the assessment roll on which the taxes are one or 
more years delinquent may be subject to tax sale as prescribed 
herein and the Borough Attorney shall report to the Assembly on 
such matters as the Assembly directs. 


6.36.090  Foreclosure List.  

A. The Borough shall seek to foreclose delinquent tax 
liens by presenting a petition for judgment and a certified copy
of the foreclosure list in the proper court for judgment.

B. The foreclosure list shall be arranged in alphabetical 
order as to last name and shall include 

l. the last known owner; 

2. 
the property description as stated on the 
assessment roll;


3. 
years and amounts of delinquency; 


4. 
penalty and interest due; 




5. 
a statement that the list is available for public 
inspection at the Clerk's office; and


6. 
a statement that the list has been presented to
the proper court with a petition for judgment and decree.



C. The Borough shall publish the foreclosure list for 
four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation 
distributed in the Borough, or, if there is no newspaper of 
general circulation distributed in the Borough, post the list at
three public places for at least thirty days.

D. Within ten days after the first publication or 
posting, the Borough shall mail to the last known owner of each
property, as the owner's name and address appear on the list, a
notice advising of the foreclosure proceeding in which a 
petition for judgment of foreclosure has been filed and 
describing the property and the amount due as stated on the 
list. 

E. Completion of the requirements of (A) -(D) of this 
section constitutes and has the same force and effect as the 
filing of an individual and separate complaint and service of 

summons to foreclose a lien against each property described on 
the foreclosure list. 

6.36.100 Clearing Delinquencies. During the time of the 
publication or posting of the foreclosure list and up to the 
time of transfer to the Borough, a person may pay the taxes, 
together with the penalty, interest, and proportionate share of 
the costs of publication and foreclosure. The tax collector, or 
other officer, shall make proper notation of such payment on the 
foreclosure list. 

6.36.110 List to Lienholder. A mortgagee or other holder 
of a recorded lien on real property may file with the tax 
collector a request that notice of any foreclosure list 
including such real property be given to such mortgagee or other 
lienholder. The request shall contain the name and address of 
the person filing it, the description of the property and the 
name of the owner or reputed owner thereof, and the date of 
expiration of the mortgage or lien, unless a further request 
therefor is filed. If the mortgagee or lienholder furnishes a 
duplicate form of the request for notice, the tax collector 
shall certify thereon to the filing and return the duplicate to 
the person making the request. Whenever any property described 
in the request for notice is included in a foreclosure list, the
tax collector shall send by certified mail written notice 
thereof to the mortgagee or other lienholder. At the time of 
mailing the notice, the tax collector shall note that fact in 
ink in the foreclosure list opposite the description of the 
property. The notation in the list is prima facie evidence that
the notice was mailed. Where the same mortgagee or lienholder 
has filed requests for notices on two or more properties 
included in the foreclosure list, one notice may be issued 
covering all such properties. 


6.36.120  Foreclosure Proceedings.  

A. One general foreclosure proceeding shall be brought on
the part of the Borough to foreclose the tax liens against the
properties included in the foreclosure list. The person whose 
name appears in the latest assessment roll as the owner of the
property therein described shall be considered and treated as 
the owner of the property. Each such proceeding shall be a 
proceeding in rem against the property itself. If the owner of 
any property is unknown, then such property shall be proceeded 
against as belonging to "unknown owner". Tax foreclosure 
proceedings under this title shall be given priority over all
other civil proceedings. 

B. The costs of publication of the foreclosure list and 
of the tax foreclosure proceedings shall be taxed by the clerk 
of the court and paid by the Borough, but the same shall be 
apportioned by the clerk of the court to the properties ordered 
foreclosed so that each property will bear its proportionate 
share of such costs and the same shall thereafter be a charge
against the property to which it is proportioned.

C. A person having an interest in a property on the 
foreclosure list may file an answer within 30 days after the 
date of last publication or posting. Such answer shall be in 
writing and specify the grounds of objection. The court shall 
make its decision in summary proceedings. The foreclosure 
list shall be prima facie evidence that the assessment and levy
of the tax is valid and that the tax is unpaid. No objection to
the manner of the assessment and levy of the tax or any of the
subsequent proceedings shall be entertained by the court which 
does not affect the substantial rights of the party interposing 
the objection. 

6.36.130 Judgment. The court shall in a proper case give
judgment and decree that the tax liens be foreclosed. It is a 
several judgment against and a lien on each parcel. 


6.36.140  Transfer and Appeal.  

A. Foreclosed properties are transferred to the Borough 
for the lien amount. When answers are filed the court may enter 
judgment against and order the transfer to the Borough of all 
other properties on the list pending determination of the 
matters in controversy. The court shall hear and determine the 
issues raised by the complaint and answers in the same manner 
and under the same rules as it hears and determines other 
actions. 

B. The court clerk shall deliver a certified copy of the 
judgment and decree to the Borough Clerk. The certified 
judgment and decree constitutes a transfer to the Borough.

C. The judgment and decree stops objections to it that 
could have been presented before judgment and decree. Appeal 
from a judgment and decree of foreclosure, or from a final order
in the proceeding, may be taken in the manner provided for 
appeals in civil  actions. 


6.36.150  Redemption Period.  

A. Properties transferred to the Borough are held by the 
Borough for at least one year. During the redemption period a
party having an interest in the property may redeem it by paying
the lien amount plus penalties, interest and costs, including 

all costs incurred under section 6.36.190(A). Property redeemed 
is subject to all accrued taxes, assessments, liens and claims 
as though it had continued in private ownership. Only the 
amount applicable under the judgment and decree must be paid in 
order to redeem the property.

B. A person holding a mortgage or other lien of record 
covering only a portion of a parcel of real property included in
the judgment and decree of foreclosure may redeem that portion 
by paying the proportionate amount applicable under the judgment 
and decree. 

6.36.160 Effect. Receipt of redemption money by the 
Borough releases the judgment obtained under 6.36.130. The 
Finance Director shall record the redemption and issue a 
certificate containing a property description, the redemption 
amount and the dates of judgment and decree of foreclosure. The 
Finance Director shall file the certificate with the recorder 
and collect the recording fee from the person redeeming at the 
time of redemption. The court clerk shall file the certificate 
as part of the judgment roll. 

6.36.170 Additional Liens. If a property included in a 
foreclosure list is removed after payment of delinquencies or 
redemption by another lienholder, the payment represented by
receipt for payment constitutes an additional lien on the 
property, collectible by the lienholder in the same manner as
the original lien. 

6.36.180 Possession During Redemption Period. Foreclosure 
does not affect the former owner's right to possession during 
the redemption period. In the event that waste is committed by
the former owner, or by anyone acting under the permission or 
control of the former owner, the Borough may declare an 
immediate forfeiture of the right to possession. 


6.36.190  Expiration.  

A. At least thirty days before the expiration of the 
redemption period the Finance Director shall publish a 
redemption period expiration notice. The notice shall contain 
the date of judgment, the date of expiration of the period of
redemption and a warning to the effect that all properties 
ordered sold under the judgment, unless redeemed, shall be 
deeded to the Borough immediately on expiration of the period of 
redemption and that every right or interest of any person in the
properties will be forfeited forever to the Borough. The notice 
is published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a 

newspaper of general circulation distributed within the Borough.  
If there is no newspaper of general circulation distributed 
within the Borough, the notice is posted in three public places 
for at least four consecutive weeks. The Finance Director shall 
send a copy of the published notice by certified mail to each
record owner of property against which a judgment of foreclosure
has been taken, and, if the assessed value of the property is
more than $10,000, to all holders of mortgages or other liens of
record on the property. The notice shall be mailed within five 
days of the first publication or posting. The mailing shall be
sufficient if mailed to the property owner and, if necessary, to 
the holder of a mortgage or recorded lien at the last address of 
record. 

B. The right of redemption shall expire thirty days after 
the date of the first notice publication or posting.

C. Costs incurred in the determination of holders  
of mortgages and other liens of record and costs of notice 
publication or posting incurred by the Borough under (A) of this
section are a lien on the property and may be recovered by the 
Borough. 


6.36.200  Deed to Borough. 

A. Unredeemed property within the Borough is deeded to 
the Borough. The deed shall be recorded in the recording 
district in which the property is located.

B. Conveyance gives the Borough clear title, except for
prior recorded tax liens of the United States and the state.

C. No deed is invalid for irregularities, omissions, or
defects in the document itself or in the proceedings under this
Chapter, unless the former owner has been misled so as to be 
injured. Two years after the date of the deed, its validity is 
conclusively presumed and any claim of the former owner or other 
person having an interest in the property is forever barred. 


6.36.210  Disposition and Sale of Foreclosed Property.  

A. The Assembly shall determine, by ordinance, whether 
foreclosed property deeded to the Borough shall be retained for
a public purpose. The ordinance shall contain the legal 
description of the property, the address or a general 
description of the property sufficient to provide the public
with notice of its location, and the name of the last record 
owner of the property as the name appears on the assessment 
rolls. 

B. Tax-foreclosed property conveyed to the Borough by tax
foreclosure and not required for a public purpose may be sold.  
Before the sale of tax foreclosed property held for a public 

purpose, the Borough, by ordinance, shall determine that a 
public need does not exist. The ordinance shall contain the 
information required under (A) of this section.

C. The clerk or the clerk's designee shall send a copy of 
the published notice of hearing of an ordinance to consider a 
determination required under (A) or (B) of this section by
certified mail to the former record owner of the property that
is the subject of the ordinance. The notice shall be mailed 
within five days after its first publication and shall be 
sufficient if mailed to the last record owner of the property as
the name appears on the assessment rolls of the Borough.

D. The provisions of (C) of this section do not apply 
with respect to property that has been held by the Borough for a 
period of more than ten years after the close of the redemption
period. 


6.36.220  Repurchase by Record Owner.  

A. The record owner at the time of tax foreclosure of 
property acquired by the Borough, or the assigns of that record 
owner, may, within ten years and before the sale or contract of
sale of the tax-foreclosed property by the Borough, repurchase
the property. The Borough shall sell the property for the full
amount applicable to the property under the judgment and decree
plus, (1) interest at the rate of 8 percent a year from the date
of entry of the judgment of foreclosure to the date of 
repurchase; (2) delinquent taxes assessed and levied as though
it had continued in private ownership; (3) costs of foreclosure 
and sale incurred by the Borough; and (4) costs of maintaining 
and organizing the property incurred by the Borough including 
insurance, repairs, association dues, and management fees, that 
exceed amounts received by the Borough for the use of the 
property.

B. After adoption of an ordinance providing for the 
retention of tax-foreclosed property by the Borough for a public
purpose, the right of the former record owner to repurchase the 
property ceases. 

6.36.230 Proceeds of Tax Sale. If tax-foreclosed property
that has been held by the Borough for less than ten years after 
the close of the redemption period and never designated for a 
public purpose is sold at a tax-foreclosure sale, the former 
record owner is entitled to the portion of the proceeds of the
sale that exceeds the amount of the foreclosure judgment, plus
interest thereon, the amount equal to taxes that would have been
assessed and levied after foreclosure if the property had 
continued in private ownership, penalty, interest, costs to the 

Borough of foreclosing and selling the property, and costs to 
the Borough of maintaining and managing the property that exceed 
amounts received by the Borough for the use of the property. If 
the proceeds of the sale of tax-foreclosed property exceed this 
total, the Borough shall provide the former owner of the 
property written notice advising of the amount of the excess and 
the manner in which a claim for the balance of the proceeds may 
be submitted. Notice is sufficient under this section if mailed 
to the former record owner at his last address of record. On 
presentation of a proper claim, the Borough shall remit the 
excess to the former record owner, A claim for the excess not 
filed within six months of the date of sale is forever barred. 

6.36.240 Payment of Taxes Upon Public Utilization. If the 
Borough takes title to tax-foreclosed property for a public 
purpose, the Borough shall satisfy unpaid taxes and assessments 
against the property held by other municipalities, with accrued 
interest but without penalty. If the amount required to satisfy 
the unpaid taxes and assessments exceeds the assessed value of 
the property, the Borough shall pay the other municipalities the 
assessed value, which shall be divided between the other 
municipalities in proportion to their respective taxes and 
assessments against the property at the time of foreclosure. 


6.36.250  Refund of Taxes.  

A. If a taxpayer pays taxes under protest, the taxpayer
may bring suit in the superior court against the Borough for the
recovery of the taxes. If judgment for recovery is given 
against the Borough, the Borough shall refund the amount of the 
taxes to the taxpayer with interest at eight percent from the 
date of payment plus costs.

B. If, in payment of taxes legally imposed, a remittance 
by a taxpayer through error or otherwise exceeds the amount due,
and the Borough, on audit of the account in question, is 
satisfied that this is the case, the Borough shall refund the 
excess to the taxpayer with interest at eight percent from the 
date of payment. A claim for refund not filed within one year
after the due date of the tax is forever barred. 

6.36.260 Enforcement of Special Assessments. The word 
"tax" as used in this Chapter shall apply to special assessments 
for improvements as authorized by the Borough and both such
delinquent special assessments as well as delinquent taxes shall
be included on the foreclosure list, but when so included shall 
be stated separately and the penalties and interest due on each
shall also be stated separately. 

6.36.270 Collection of Delinquent Taxes on Certain 
Governmental Property. Sections 6.36.050 and 6.36.070 -240 do 
not apply to property taxable under 6.28.040(A)(1)(b) or (c) or
to federal property not exempted under 6.28.040 (A)(8). The 
Borough may bring an action in the superior court to compel 
payment of property taxes due from the state, municipal, or 
federal entity if the entity does not pay the amount due within
six months after the date that the taxes are due.

A. A seller shall add the 5% sales tax to the selling 
price which the seller collects at the time of the sale or at 
the time of collection with respect to credit transactions. If 
the buyer refuses to pay the tax, the seller is exempt from any 
violations or penalties otherwise imposed if he/she reports to
the Borough all the facts known to him concerning the sale and
refusal within one business day of the refusal. Otherwise, if 
the seller fails to collect the tax or the buyer refuses to pay 
the tax, the seller is liable therefor. The tax is a debt from
the buyer to the seller until paid and is recoverable at law in 

the same manner as other debts. The buyer is liable to the 
Borough for the tax notwithstanding the seller's duty to 
collect. 

B. The tax shall be stated separately on any sales 
receipt or slips, rent receipts, charge tickets, invoices, 
statements of account, or other tangible evidence of sale.

other transfer of the corporation or company does not discharge 
this liability.

under this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right to 
protest, appeal or otherwise challenge the amount due. The 
Finance Director shall issue a written ruling on a sellers 
protest within thirty (30) days of receipt of the protest and 
remittance if timely filed.  The seller has the burden of proof; 


3. 
Hearing. Notify the seller in writing by
certified mail, sent to the sellers last known address, that a 
hearing will be held to determine the sales tax liability of the
seller at a specified time and place not less than fifteen days
after the date of the notice. The seller shall present himself 
at the hearing and make available for inspection his books, 
papers, records and other memoranda pertaining to gross revenues 
derived from his commercial transactions sufficient to enable 
the Borough to make a determination whether the return is 
required or tax due;


4. 
Publish. Publish in a newspaper of general 
circulation within the Borough, or if there is no such 
newspaper, post in three separate places in the Borough, the
name and amount of sales tax, interest and penalty due from a
seller who is delinquent under this Chapter.


5. 
Demand. Make written demand upon the seller,
mailed to his last known address, for submission of the return 
and/or payment.

6.40.130 Record Keeping. A seller shall retain for a 
period of seven years all of the sales tax returns, reports,
forms, records and supporting schedules as may be required by 
the Borough. 

6.40.140 Tax as Lien. The tax, interest and any penalties 
imposed under this Chapter, and any administrative costs, 
including attorney fees and litigation costs, incurred by the 
Borough to collect the tax, shall constitute a lien in favor of
the Borough upon all the real and personal property of the 
person owing the tax. The lien arises upon delinquency and 
continues until the liability is satisfied or the lien is 
foreclosed. A notice of lien may be filed in the office of the 
recorder for the Juneau Recording District. The Borough may 
also, at its discretion, file a notice of lien in any other 
recording district. When recorded, the sales tax has priority 
over all other liens except (1) liens for property taxes and 
special assessments; (2) liens that were perfected before the 
recording of the sales tax lien for amounts actually advanced
before the recording of the sales tax lien; (3) mechanics' and 
materialmen's for which claims for lien under AS 34.35.070 or 
notices of right to lien under AS 34.35.064 have been recorded 
before the recording of the sales tax lien. 

6.40.150 Rules and Regulations. The Mayor shall from time 
to time cause to be promulgated rules and regulations as are 
necessary and advisable to provide for the application and 
interpretation of this Chapter and to submit them to the

to be performed an audit of any individual or entity conducting 
sales or believed to be conducting sales within the Borough, and 
any sales tax returns filed with the Borough.

B. Upon written notification and request by the 
Borough, mailed to the seller at the seller's last known 
address, a seller shall present himself at a specified date and 
time and bring with him the books, papers, records and any other
documentation of the business requested by the Borough. Said 
documents may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Sales journals, general ledgers, bank statements, income 
statements, balance sheets, charts of account, and federal 
income 
tax returns. 

C. Failure by the seller to comply with the 
provisions of paragraph B above shall constitute a violation of
the Code of the City and Borough of Yakutat and shall be 
punishable by a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars 
($1,000.00) which may be imposed in addition to injunctive and 
compensatory relief. Each day that a violation continues 
constitutes a separate violation. 


6.40.190 Notification to the Borough.

annual basis thereafter, a current copy of the State of Alaska 
Business License issued to it, if it is required to have one.
Thereafter, the owner shall notify the Borough of any changes in 
the information provided.

C. If, at the time of enactment of this ordinance, a 
business is already transacting business within the Borough, the
owner of the business shall provide the required notification to 
the Borough as set forth in paragraph B above by the due date of 

the first sales tax return due after enactment of this 
ordinance. 

6.40.200 Confidentiality of Records. All tax returns filed 
under this Chapter, all data obtained from such tax returns, and 
all financial information obtained from an inspection of records
or audit conducted under this Chapter are confidential and may 
not be released by the Borough except upon court order or when 
necessary to enforce the provisions of or to collect the taxes 
due under this Chapter. The Borough may publish at any time the 
names of delinquent taxpayers and the amounts and periods of 
delinquency. 

6.40.210 Claims against the Borough. Any claim brought
against the Borough to seek a refund of any amount paid to the 
Borough under this Chapter, including a claim for refund or 
return of any sums claimed to have been paid in error, shall be 
commenced within two years of the due date of the tax return

description of the improvement sought by the petition. The 
original or copies of the petition shall be signed by the owners
of properties which will bear at least fifty percent of the 
estimated cost of the improvement sought by the petition.

B. Notwithstanding Subsection (A), in the case of 
improvements sought for fallout or disaster shelters, parks and 
playgrounds, changes in channels of streams or watercourses, or 
bridges, culverts, bulkheads, embankments or dikes for streams 
or watercourses wherein the Borough has determined not to 

participate in the cost of such improvements, the petition shall
bear the signatures of the owners of the properties which shall 
bear at least seventy-five percent of the cost of improvements
sought by the petition.

C. The petition when signed shall be filed with the 
Borough Clerk. No property owner may withdraw his signature of 
approval for three months after the petition has been filed with
the Borough Clerk, unless authorized by the Assembly. 

6.44.040 Initiation by Assembly --Authorization. The 
Assembly, by motion or other action, may direct the Borough 
Manager or approve his request to make a survey and report on a 
proposed Assembly-initiated special assessment district. 

6.44.050 Survey and Report of Proposed District. Upon the 
filing with the Borough Clerk of a petition under Section .030
of this Chapter, or upon the direction of the Assembly under 
Section .040, the Borough Manager shall make a survey and report 
to the Assembly concerning the need for and the estimated cost
of the proposed improvement. The report shall contain a plan
defining the district, outlining the properties to be assessed 
and showing the desirable extent of the proposed improvement.
The district may be defined:

A. By a boundary description; or 

B. By a designation of the properties to be assessed 
within the district by lot, block and subdivision or, if 
unsubdivided, by other appropriate designation. The designation 
may generally refer to streets, alleys, intersections and all 
other public properties and rights-of-way to be included within 
the district as "and included public streets, rights-of-way and 
properties".

The survey and report of the Borough Manager may be made
either before or at the time of the public hearing on the 
necessity for the proposed improvement. 


6.44.060  Public Hearing on Necessity of Improvement.  

A. The Assembly shall hold a public hearing on the 
necessity for the proposed improvement. The Assembly or Borough 
Manager shall fix the time and place of the public hearing which
may be continued from time to time as the Assembly may decide.
After hearing all interested persons favoring or opposing the 
proposed improvement, the Assembly may decrease the extent or 
value of the improvement, or may delete from the district 
properties not benefited in whole or in part by the improvement.

B. In a hearing on an improvement initiated by a petition 
under Section .030(A), no change may be made resulting in an 

improvement district containing petitioners of properties 
bearing less than fifty percent of the estimated cost of the 
improvement, unless other sufficient property owners are added 
to the petition prior to Assembly action on the petition.

C. In a hearing on an improvement initiated by a petition 
under Section .030(B), no change may be made resulting in an 
improvement district containing petitioners of properties 
bearing less than seventy-five percent of the estimated cost of 
the improvement, unless other sufficient property owners are 
added to the petition prior to Assembly action on the petition.

D. If written protests as to the necessity of the local 
improvement are made by the owners of property who shall bear
fifty percent or more of the estimated cost of the improvement,
the Assembly shall not proceed with the improvement until the 
protests have been reduced to less than fifty percent.

E. Notice of the public hearing provided for herein shall 
be given in accordance with Section .110 of this Chapter. 


6.44.070  Assembly Action After Hearing.  

A. After the public hearing held under Section .060 of 
this Chapter is closed, the Assembly shall find by resolution 
whether to proceed or not to proceed with the proposed 
improvement.

B. An Assembly resolution to proceed must find that the 
improvement is necessary and of benefit to the properties to be 
assessed, and in the case of an improvement initiated by a 
petition under Section .030, that the petition has been signed 
by sufficient and proper petitioners. The findings of the 
Assembly are conclusive. The resolution shall require an 
account to be kept of all costs of the improvement and direct
the Borough Manager to prepare the assessment roll. The 
Assembly, in the resolution, shall assess the authorized 
percentage or rate of the costs of the improvement against the 
properties within the district in:

1. 
Equal shares for every property in the district; 
or 


2. 
Proportionate shares based on the percentage an 
individual property bears to the total area of the district; or



3. A combination of both. 


6.44.080  Preparation of Assessment Roll.  

A. After the improvement plan has been completed and the 
costs of the improvement computed, the Borough Manager shall 
prepare an assessment roll for the special assessment district.  
The assessment roll shall contain, as to each property to be 
assessed, a brief description or designation of the property, 

the name of the owner or reputed owner of the property and the 
amount assessed against the property.

B. When the assessment roll is completed, the Assembly or 
Borough Manager shall fix a time and place for a public hearing
on objections to the assessment roll. Notice of the public 
hearing shall be given in accordance with Section .110 of this
Chapter. 

6.44.090 Public Hearing on Assessment Roll. At the public 
hearing on the assessment roll, an owner of property to be 
assessed shall have the right to present his objection to the 
assessment roll by showing errors and inequalities in the 
assessment roll and submitting any reason for amendments and 
correction of the assessment roll. The public hearing may be 
continued from time to time as the Assembly may decide. After 
the public hearing, the Assembly shall correct any error or 
inequality in the assessment roll. When the roll is finally 
determined, the Borough Clerk shall so certify. 

6.44.100 Confirmation of Assessment Roll. After the 
public hearing and determination of the assessment roll, the 
Assembly, by resolution, shall confirm the special assessment 
roll of the special assessment district. The resolution shall 
provide for the levy and fix a schedule of dates when the 
special assessment or special assessment installment payments 
become due and delinquent. 

6.44.110 Notice Required for Public Hearings. Notice by 
publication and mail shall be given for the public hearings 
required by Sections .060 and .090 of this Chapter.

A. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a 
newspaper of general circulation within the Borough at least 
once a week for four consecutive weeks prior to the time fixed
for the hearing. If there is no such newspaper, notice of 
public hearing shall be published by posting the notice in three 
public places in the Borough for at least thirty days. The 
notice to be published shall include a summary of the 
improvement, the designation of the properties to be assessed in
the special assessment district, the purpose of the public 
hearing and the time and place fixed for the public hearing.

B. The Borough Clerk shall send a written notice by first 
class mail at least fifteen days prior to the time of the 
hearing to each owner of property to be assessed. The notice by 
mail shall include a summary of the improvement, the designation
of the owner's property to be assessed, the purpose of the 
public hearing, the amount of estimated or actual assessment 

against the property and the time and place fixed for the public
hearing.

C. Each notice shall generally inform the property owner 
of the manner and method of protesting or objecting to the 
action to be taken at the public hearing. 


6.44.120  Recording of Assembly Resolution.  

A. Upon Assembly request, the Borough Attorney shall file 
on record with the district recorder all Assembly resolutions 
creating or establishing assessment districts.

B. Failure to file a resolution as required by Subsection

(A) shall not operate as to impair any right or interest the 
Borough has in an assessment district under applicable Borough
ordinances or state law. 

6.44.130 Determination of Property Assessed. The Assembly
may assess for an improvement any real property or any interest
therein, specially benefited, and the property specially 
benefited may include abutting, adjoining, adjacent, contiguous, 
noncontiguous or other property or interests in property 
benefited directly or indirectly by the improvement. The 
property to be assessed may include any property which is 
otherwise for any reason exempt from taxation by law. A 
benefited property may be included in whole or in part in more
than one special assessment district. 

6.44.140 Determination of Property Owner. The person 
whose name is listed on the latest assessment roll as the owner 
of the property to be assessed is conclusively presumed to be 
the legal owner of the property. If the property owner is 
unknown, the property may be assessed in the name of the 
"unknown owner". No assessment is invalidated by a mistake,
omission or error in the name of the owner if the property is 
correctly described. 

6.44.150 Determination of Amount Assessed. The Assembly 
may assess one hundred percent of any or all costs of an 
improvement against each parcel of property benefited by the 
improvement. Unless the Assembly provides otherwise by
resolution under Section .070(B), the Assembly shall assess each 
parcel of property in a special assessment district in 
proportionate to, and not to exceed, the value of the benefits
received from the improvement. 


6.44.160  Computation of Assessments.  

A. A correct account shall be kept of all the expenses of 
the improvement. The expenses to be assessed may include all 
costs incident to the making of the improvement, as well as the
costs of all times of work or expense which reasonably enter 
into the making of the improvement or reasonably arise in 
connection with the improvement, including but not limited to 
interest during construction, engineers' and attorneys' fees, 
property acquisition and financing costs, including interest and
costs to be incurred in the collection of the assessment. 

B. After the total cost of the improvement is established
or estimated, that portion of the cost to be borne by special
assessments shall be apportioned and spread against the various 
properties in accordance with the authorized rate or percentage 
and entered on the assessment roll. In anticipation of 
delinquent assessments, there may be added to each separate
assessment appearing on the assessment roll a sum not less than
three percent nor greater than ten percent of the assessment. 
Such assessment roll shall contain a brief description or 
designation of each tract of property, the name of the owner or
reputed owner, and the amount of the proposed assessment. 

6.44.170 Notice of Assessment. Within thirty days after 
the resolution set forth in Section .100 of this Chapter 
confirming the assessment roll and fixing the date of 
delinquency, the Borough Clerk shall mail with postage prepaid
an assessment notice to the owner of each property assessed. 
The notice shall designate the property, the amount of the 
assessment, the schedule of payments and delinquencies, and the 
amount of the penalty and interest. Not more than sixty nor 
less than thirty days before the date the assessment becomes 
delinquent, the finance director shall mail a payment notice to
each property owner, but the failure to mail the notice shall in
no way affect any liability for or enforcement of payment of all
or any part of the special assessment. 


6.44.180  Payment.  

A. No payment shall be required within sixty days after 
the date of the resolution set forth in Section .100 of this 
Chapter.

B. Deferred or installment payments may bear interest at
a rate not to exceed the effective interest rate of the last 
bonds sold to finance similar improvements, from the date of the 
confirmation of the assessment roll until paid.

C. A penalty of eight percent shall be added to any
assessment or assessment installment not paid before the date of
delinquency, and both the assessment and penalty shall accrue 

interest at the rate of eight percent per year until paid.  
Penalty and interest may be waived by the Mayor where the sum
does not exceed two hundred dollars and such penalty and 
interest accrued through no fault of the property owner so 
assessed. The Borough Assembly may waive penalty and interest
where the sum exceeds two hundred dollars and such penalty and 
interest accrued through no fault of the property owner so 
assessed. 


6.44.190  Objection and Appeal.  

A. The validity of an assessment is waived and may not be 
contested in any manner in any proceeding by a person who did
not file with the Borough Clerk a written objection to the 
assessment roll prior to its confirmation.

B. The decision of the Assembly upon an objection may be 
appealed to the proper court within sixty days of the date of
confirmation of the assessment roll. If no objection is filed 
or an appeal taken within that time, the assessment procedure 
shall be considered valid in all respects. 

6.44.200 Special Assessment Lien. A special assessment, 
together with interest, collection and penalty charges, is a 
lien upon the property assessed from the time the special 
assessment is levied in the resolution confirming the assessment
roll, second in priority only to property taxes and prior 
special assessments. The lien shall be of the same character, 
effect and duration as a lien for Borough real property taxes.  
A lien for a special assessment may be collected, foreclosed and 
otherwise enforced in accordance with the procedures provided in
this code and the Alaska Statutes for the collection, 
foreclosure and enforcement of municipal tax liens on real 
property. 

6.44.210 Cumulative Enforcement. The collection, 
foreclosure or enforcement of any installment or any part of a 
special assessment shall not bar, prevent or otherwise 
extinguish the right of the Borough to collect, foreclose or 
enforce the payment of any other installment or part of the same
or any other special assessment. 


6.44.220  Change in District Boundaries --Public Hearing.  

A. In its discretion, the Assembly may, by ordinance, at 
any time eliminate from the district any unit of the improvement 
which is not completed and may proceed with the construction of 
the balance of the improvements within the district as fully and 
completely as though the eliminated unit had not been included 

within the district. The assessments to be levied to pay part 
or all of the costs of the improvements actually constructed may 
be levied only against the properties within the district 
specially benefited thereby.

B. The Assembly, by resolution, shall fix a time, date 
and place for a public hearing on the question of whether it 
should abandon the acquisition, construction and installation of
a portion of the improvement. Notice of the hearing shall be
published once at least fifteen days prior to the date thereof 
in a newspaper of general circulation within the Borough, or 
posted in three different places in the Borough, and shall be 
mailed on or prior to the date of publication to all owners of 
property within the district. The notice shall state the 
proposed Assembly action and shall also require that any owner 
who objects thereto shall file a written notice of that 
objection with the clerk at or prior to the hearing.

C. At the time of the hearing the Assembly shall hear
all objections and evidence material to the question of whether 
the completion of the improvements should be abandoned. After 
considering the evidence, the Assembly shall then decide whether
to abandon a portion of the improvements. In the event the 
Assembly decides that a portion of the improvements should not 
be completed, the costs of improvements incurred to the time of 
the abandonment shall be assessed only against the property 
within the district specially benefited by the improvements 
actually completed. 


6.44.230 Correction of Invalid Special Assessments.  

A. If any special assessment procedure of the Assembly is
invalid for any reason, the Assembly may correct the same at any
time within ninety days after the confirmation of the special 
assessment roll or after final determination of any litigation
thereon, whether before or after the completion of the local 
improvement to which the special assessment applies.

B. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction 
orders that any or all of a special assessment may not be 
assessed or enforced by the Assembly because of any invalid 
special assessment procedure, the Assembly may make a new 
assessment or reassessment upon the properties specifically
benefited by the improvement by adopting a resolution to make a 
new assessment or a reassessment of the properties specially 
benefited by the improvement. In the resolution, the Assembly
shall provide for the time and date of a public hearing on the 
new assessment or reassessment, shall direct the Borough Manager
to prepare the assessment roll and shall assess the appropriate 
assessment against the property in the district. The procedures 

set forth in Sections .080 through .110 of this Chapter shall be
followed in making the new assessment or reassessment, unless 
that procedure is in conflict with this Section, in which event 
the provisions of this Section shall apply. The previous 
findings of benefit and necessity for the improvement shall 
continue in full force and effect in any assessment or 
reassessment unless invalidated by a court order.

C. In the event that findings of necessity and benefit 
are necessary to correct the invalid special assessment 
procedure, the Assembly may proceed to make a new assessment or 
reassessment of the property specially benefited by initiating 
an Assembly-initiated special assessment district in accordance 
with Section .040. 

D. In any new assessment or reassessment by the Assembly,
all sums paid upon the former assessment shall be credited to 
the property upon any new assessment or reassessment and the new 
assessment or reassessment shall to that extent be deemed 
satisfied. 

If a refund, rather than a credit, is determined, then the 
Assembly in the resolution confirming the assessment roll shall 
provide for a refund to the person having paid the amount of 
assessment to be refunded. 

No interest or penalty shall be charged by virtue of the 
fact that the original assessment was not pursued to completion.

E. The new assessment or reassessment when completed 
shall be enforced and collected in the same manner that special 
assessments are enforced and collected. 


6.44.240  Special Assessment Bonds.  

A. The Assembly may, by ordinance, authorize the issuance 
and sale of special assessment bonds to pay all or part of the 
cost of an improvement in a special assessment district. The 
principal and interest of bonds issued shall be payable solely 
from the levy of special assessments against the property to be 
benefited. The assessments shall be deposited into an account 
for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The 
property benefited may be pledged by the Assembly to secure a 
payment.

B. Upon default in a payment due on a special assessment 
bond, a bond-holder may enforce payment of principal and 
interest and costs of collection in a civil action in the same 
manner and with the same effect as actions for the foreclosure 
of mortgages on real property. Foreclosure shall be against all 
property on which assessments are in default. The period for 
redemption shall be the same as in the case of a mortgage 
foreclosure on real property. 

6.44.250 Capital Improvements by Agreement. When the 
owners of one hundred percent of the property bearing the cost
of improvements agree, the Assembly may, by ordinance, authorize

continues until the liability is satisfied or the lien is 
foreclosed. A notice of lien may be filed in the office of the 
recorder for the Juneau Recording District. The Borough may 
also, at its discretion, file a notice of lien in any other
recording district. When recorded, the tax has priority over all
other liens except (1) liens for property taxes and special 
assessments; (2) liens that were perfected before the recording 
of the tax lien for amounts actually advanced before the 
recording of the tax lien; (3) mechanics' and materialman's

protestor who is dissatisfied with the Assemblys decision may
appeal that decision to the superior court within thirty (30)
days of issuance of that decision, and otherwise in accordance 
with the Alaska Appellate Rules of Procedure. The protestors 
failure to timely appeal in accordance with those rules 
constitutes a waiver of appeal rights and the Assemblys 
decision becomes final.

Investment management of the assets of the Fund shall be in 
accordance with the following asset allocation guidelines, with 
a target return of 4% above inflation: 

Type Target % Minimum/Maximum 

U.S. equity 30 20/40 
Foreign equity 15 10/20 
Fixed Income 40 30/50 
Alternatives 10 00/15 
Cash/Cash equivalent 05 02/20 

6.60.070 Distribution of Fund Earnings. The distribution 
of Fund earnings shall be as follows:

(A) 
The Fund shall be protected from inflation by
retaining in the Fund each year earnings equal to the amount of 


inflation from the previous calendar year. The percent of 
inflation shall be calculated by the annual percent change in 
the Anchorage Consumer Price Index  All Urban (CPI-U) for that 
year. The amount that should be in the Fund through inflation 
proofing is cumulative from the date of initial investment by 
the Fund. In the event that there is not enough earnings to 
inflation proof the Fund in a given year, no earnings may be 
distributed until the inflation proofing for that year, and all
previous years, is satisfied.


(B) 
After the Fund is inflation proofed, any earnings from
the previous calendar year which total up to four percent (4%)
may be distributed to the Borough general fund. A distribution 
made under this paragraph shall be timed so as to minimize the
possibility of a loss occasioned by the sale of a security 
necessary to meet such a distribution.


(C) 
Any Fund earnings in a calendar year in excess of the 
inflation proofing required by (A), and a permitted 
distribution to the general fund under (B), shall be retained in 
the Fund for growth.


(D) 
New deposits made into the Fund during any calendar
year pursuant to the provisions of section 6.60.020 shall not be 
deemed to be earnings for purposes of that years annual 
retention and distributions under paragraphs (A)-(C) above.

requiring execution by the Borough shall be signed by the Mayor 
or the Borough Manager and attested by the Borough Clerk. The 
form of any instrument shall be reviewed by the Borough 
Attorney. Leases of Borough real property are additionally
governed by the provisions of Chapter 7.20 of this Code. 

7.16.030 Sale or Disposal --Rights and Powers. The 
Borough shall have and may exercise all rights and powers in the
sale or disposal of real property as if the Borough were a

property, including property acquired or held for or devoted to
a public use, when in the judgment of the Borough Assembly it is 
no longer required for municipal purposes. 

7.16.040 Disposition Procedures. The Borough may
dispose of an interest in any real property which is no longer
necessary for municipal purposes as follows:

1. 
The Borough Assembly shall initiate any
disposal of an interest in real property by resolution. This 
Chapter does not apply to property acquired by tax foreclosure 
or condemnation proceeding. 


2. 
All disposals shall be made at current 
assessed value or at current appraised value unless otherwise 
determined by a resolution or ordinance of the Assembly. 
Exceptions may be made where the Assembly finds that a 
particular disposition will be in the public interest. 


3. 
Except as provided by in Sections 7.16.060
through .080, all disposals of interests in real property shall 
be by sealed bid to the highest responsible bidder, provided
however that the Borough Assembly may reject all bids within two 
weeks of the date of the bid opening.  


4. 
A notice of the proposed disposal of any
interest in real property shall be posted in at least three 
public places in the Borough not less than thirty days before 
the date of the bid opening or not less than thirty days before 
the date of the passage of the resolution authorizing the 
disposal. The published notice shall include a legal 
description of the property and shall describe the Borough's 
interest, the method of disposal, the value of the interest 
according to current assessment or current appraisal, the date 
of the proposed disposal and the time, place and manner in which
the bids shall be submitted and opened, or the proposed disposal
shall occur. 


5.

Clerk within the time set in the published notice for submission 
of bids.  All bids shall be opened publicly.

approve, after public notice, the conveyance and exchange of a 
parcel of Borough property for an equivalent parcel of property
owned by another person, subject to such conditions as the 
Assembly may impose on the exchange, whenever in the judgment of 

the Assembly it is advantageous to the Borough to make the 
property exchange. 

7.16.060 Grants to Governmental Units and for Federal 
and State Programs. Notwithstanding the provisions of 7.16.040,
the Assembly may grant or devote real property no longer held
for public purpose to the United States, the State of Alaska, a
local subdivision or an agency of any of these governments (and
including a tribal government) for a consideration agreed upon 
between the Borough and the grantee (including for an amount 
less than current assessed or appraised value) and without a 
bidding process, if the grant or devotion is for a public 
purpose and the Assembly determines it is advantageous to the 
Borough. Any Assembly approval of a federal or state program 
providing for the participation or cooperation of the Borough by 
grant or devotion of the real property is a sale of that real
property for the consideration stated in the program. 


7.16.065 Direct sales of borough properties.  

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of 7.16.040 and 
where the Assembly considers it advantageous to the Borough, the 
Assembly may dispose of borough-owned real property not held for 
a public purpose by direct sale to a qualified buyer, without a
bidding process, where 1) a property has an assessed or 
appraised value which does not exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars
($15,000); or 2) the Assembly finds that the potential buyers of 
a property are limited to owners of directly adjacent properties 
due to access, topography or like matters which otherwise 
restrict development or sale of the borough-owned property, 
provided that all directly adjacent owners shall be provided 
written notice of a potential sale. 

B. The sale price of any borough-owned property sold 
hereunder must equal or exceed the most current assessed or 
appraised value for the property, and the sale price must be 
paid in full to the Borough at the time of conveyance. 

C. Application for a direct sale shall be made to 
the Borough Planner on forms provided by the Borough. An 
application shall be reviewed first by the Borough Planning and
Zoning Commission, and the Commission's recommendation conveyed
to the Assembly. 

7.16.070 Sale or Disposal of Industrial Sites.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of 7.16.040, the Borough may 
sell, lease or dispose of sites acquired for new industries 
benefiting the Borough without a bidding process upon the terms 
and conditions as the Borough Assembly considers advantageous to 

the civic welfare of the Borough, to a person who agrees to 
install, maintain and operate a beneficial new industry. 

7.16.080 Change of Use. Real property acquired or 
purchased for one Borough purpose may be appropriated,
transferred, assigned or directed without public sale to another
Borough purpose, whenever the Borough Assembly determines that
the purpose for which the property was acquired or purchased no 
longer exists, or the property is no longer used or useful for
the purpose. No formal conveyance is necessary to dispose of 
the real property to another Borough purpose, and the 
disposition may be made to another purpose with or without legal 
consideration for the disposition. 

7.16.090 Utilities. The Borough may sell, convey or
otherwise dispose of real property no longer used or useful in 
the operation of a Borough owned utility. Real property no 
longer needed for the purpose for which the real property was 
acquired or purchased, or utility property no longer used or 
useful in the operation of the Borough owned utility, is no 
longer property owned, held for or devoted to a public use, and
may be sold or disposed of as provided in this Chapter if the 
Assembly determines the real property is not useful to the 
Borough for any other purpose. 

7.16.100 Release of Easements. The Mayor or the 
Borough Manager, with prior approval of the Assembly, may at any 
time convey, quitclaim, release, cancel or otherwise relinquish
any real property easement, right-of-way, permit or license the 
Borough may have or hold for the purpose of installing,
constructing, or maintaining a public improvement, whenever the
interest is no longer used or useful for that purpose. 

7.16.110 Conditions of Disposal. In the resolution 
authorizing the disposal of real property, the Assembly shall 
set forth the terms and conditions of the public sale. The 
Assembly reserves the right to reject any and all bids received
at the public sale, if the highest bid is below the minimum 
acceptable offer and costs of sale or is not made by a 
responsible bidder. The ordinance or resolution shall provide 
if the sale is for cash, or cash deposit and a purchase 
agreement. If the sale is for a cash deposit and a purchase
agreement, the Borough Manager shall prescribe the form of the 
purchase agreement. The Borough Assembly shall approve all 
public sales of real property, and shall approve any purchase
agreement prior to its execution by the Borough. The approval 

of any public sale by the Assembly authorizes the Borough 
Manager to take all steps and execute all instruments to 
complete and close the sale. The Borough Manager or his 
designee shall conduct the sale, and shall give to the buyer a
receipt of all moneys received by the Borough. A purchaser at a 
public sale who fails to make such other cash payments within 
the times required by the ordinance or resolution shall forfeit 
any cash deposit paid to the Borough.  

7.16.120 Purchase Agreement. A purchaser of real 
property from the Borough may purchase the real property by 
purchase agreement if provided in the ordinance or resolution 
for the sale. Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance or 
resolution for the sale, a purchase agreement shall be in the 
form of a deed of trust. The purchase agreement shall be 
executed by the Mayor or the Borough Manager attested by the 
Borough Clerk and reviewed as to form by the Borough Attorney. 

7.16.130 Sale --Employment of Broker. The Borough
may employ a broker for the sale of real property and may pay 
the broker a commission for the sale. The employment shall be
in the resolution or ordinance for the sale of the real property 
and any contract of employment shall be first approved by the 
Borough Assembly, unless the Borough Assembly authorizes the 
Borough Manager to execute the contract without the approval. 

7.16.140 Reservation of Easements and Rights-of-Way.  
The Borough may reserve any easement or right-of-way to be used
for public improvements and purposes before selling or disposing
of Borough-owned real property. The Borough Assembly may make 
such restrictions, limitations, reservations, reversions or 
other covenants it may find advantageous to the Borough even if 

Manager may provide by regulation for the procedures and forms 

the appraised value of the property is affected. these  The effect of  
reservations may be considered value of the property.   in  determining  the  appraised

as to applications, surveys, appraisals, auction, bidding, form 
of substance of purchase agreement or any other matter involving
the sale or disposition of Borough property not inconsistent 
with, and to implement the intent and purpose of, this Title.  
The absence of a regulation or an inconsistent regulation shall 
not invalidate any public sale procedure or conveyance executed 

or to be executed by the Borough, where the requirements of this
Chapter have been otherwise satisfied. 

7.16.160 Disposition by Lottery or Outcry Auction.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, the 
Assembly may provide by ordinance for the disposition of real
property by lottery or outcry auction rather than by sealed bid 
in cases where sealed bids would otherwise by required. Such 
disposition must be consistent with all other provisions of this
Chapter, except that the action providing for disposition by 
lottery or outcry auction must be taken through enactment of an 
ordinance, rather than by resolution. 

7.16.170 Easements Revocable at Will by the Borough. 
The disposition requirements and procedures of this Chapter 
shall not apply to easements across Borough land given to a 
grantee for use exclusively as a driveway to a residence or 
providing utilities to a residence, provided such easement is 
revocable at will in the discretion of the Borough. 

7.16.180 Over the Counter Sales of Borough Real 
Property. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter,
surplus real property owned by the Borough may be disposed of by
over the counter sales conducted upon the following terms and 
conditions: 

(1) 
The property must have previously been 
included for sale in a land sale conducted by the Borough under
section .040 (sealed bid) or section .160 (lottery or outcry 
auction) of this Chapter.


(2) 
The Assembly ordinance or resolution 
authorizing the land disposal under section .040 or section .160
must specifically authorize over the counter sales for parcels
not purchased at the land sale. Such authorization may include 
all unsold parcels or specific unsold parcels.


(3) 
The sale price of a parcel sold under this
section shall be the required sale price (under a lottery) or 
the minimum bid price (under a sealed bid or outcry auction) set
forth in the original resolution or ordinance authorizing the 
sale of the parcel, and the sale shall be made upon the same
terms, conditions and restrictions as set forth in that original
resolution or ordinance. 


(4) 
A parcel shall be sold under this section to 
the first potential buyer who delivers in person to the Borough,
at Municipal Hall during regular business hours, a contract of 
sale for the parcel signed by that buyer. The contract of sale 
shall be in the same form as the contract of sale utilized in 


the original land sale. If more than one signed contract of sale 
for a parcel is received by the Borough on the same business day 
and for the same sale price, then the contracts shall be deemed
to have been received simultaneously and the buyer of the parcel 
shall be determined by lot, conducted by the Borough Manager, or 
his or her designee, on the following business day.


(5) 
Any contract of sale submitted by a 
potential buyer more than sixty days from the date of the 
original land sale authorized by resolution or ordinance must be 
submitted to the Assembly at its next regularly scheduled 
Assembly meeting. The Assembly may reject the submitted 
contract of sale if in the judgment of the Assembly 1) the sale
price would result in the Borough receiving less than full and 
fair value for the parcel or 2) the parcel is then required for 
municipal purposes. The contract of sale shall be deemed 
accepted if not rejected by the Assembly at that meeting.


(6) 
Any contract of sale must be submitted by a 
potential buyer no later than one year from the date of the 
original land sale authorized by resolution or ordinance.

property, including shore lands, which the Borough owns, in 
which the Borough has right, title or interest, or to which the
Borough may become entitled may be leased as provided in this
Chapter. The term "property" as used in this Chapter includes
any and all interest in real property. 

7.20.020 Term of Lease. No lease shall be for a term 
of more than twenty-one years unless the Assembly shall 
determine from the purpose, use of the premises, and nature of 
improvements which may be placed thereon that a longer term 
would benefit the Borough and would be consistent with Borough 
planning. A lease having a term of greater than five years 
shall first be approved by the Borough Assembly. Any renewal 
period or option to renew the lease period shall be included in
the term of the lease in computing the five-year period of time. 

7.20.030 	Lease Procedures. The provisions of Section 


7.16.040 shall apply to all leases of Borough land, except as 

otherwise provided in sections 7.20.150 and 7.20.160 of this 
Chapter. 

7.20.040 Fair Rental Value. Property shall be leased 
for a fair rental value. Fair rental value means the highest
price described in terms of money for which the property would
rent if exposed for rent for a reasonable time in the open 
market for the use permitted by the Borough. With approval by
the Borough Assembly, the lease of property may be made for a
rental less than the fair rental value to a state or federal 
agency, state political subdivision or nonprofit organization, 
as may be determined by the Borough Manager to be fair and 
proper considering the public interest and the nature of the 
public use or function of the leased premises. Fair rental 
value shall not be required where the property interest of the 
Borough is subject to any term or condition restricting or 
limiting the ability of the Borough to obtain the fair rental 
value of the property. 

7.20.050 Adjustment of Rental. A lease having a term 
for more than two years shall provide for adjustment of rentals 
at specified intervals during the term of lease, and the 
intervals shall be every two years unless the lease provides for 
a longer interval, not to exceed six years. This section shall 
be incorporated in each lease by reference and enforceable as if 
fully set forth therein. 

7.20.060 Transfer of Lessee's Interest. A lessee may
sublease or assign the lease only upon approval of the transfer
by the Borough in writing. 

7.20.070 Renewal of Lease. The renewal or extension 
of the lease shall be considered as a new lease unless renewal 
or extension is provided for in the lease.  

7.20.080 Improvements and Chattels. The lease shall 
provide the terms, conditions and limitations of the removal or 
reversion of improvements or chattels upon the lease premises 
after termination of the lease. The retiring lessee may, with 
the consent of the Assembly, sell the improvements to the 
succeeding lessee. If improvements or chattels are not removed
within the time set forth in the lease, the improvements and 
chattels may, upon reasonable notice to the lessee, be sold at 
public sale to be provided by regulations of the Borough 
Manager. Proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the 
Borough's costs and expenses of maintaining, removing and 

selling the improvements and chattels and to rentals for the 
period of nonremoval. The Borough may bid at the sale and may 
be credited with the value of the Borough's costs, expenses and 
rentals due resulting from the nonremoval of the improvements or 
chattels. The Borough shall have all other rights, both legal 
and equitable, any other purchaser would have or acquire by 
reason of the sale. 

7.20.090 Inspection of Leased Premises. The lessee 
shall allow an authorized representative of the Borough to enter
the leased premises for inspection at any reasonable time. 

7.20.100 Easements and Right-of-Way. The Borough 
expressly reserves the right, without compensation or adjustment 
in rentals to the lessee, to grant surface, underground or 
overhead utility easements or rights-of-way in or upon the 
leased property, if the exercise of the right will not 
unreasonably interfere with lessee's improvements placed upon
the property and with lessee's use of the property. 


7.20.110 Condemnation of Premises --Lease 

Termination. Upon condemnation of the premises or any part
thereof by the state or federal government or agency thereof,
including inverse condemnation, the lease shall terminate 
without any liability to the Borough. The Borough shall not be
liable in damages or pay any compensation to the lessee as a 
result of the condemnation terminating the lease. 

7.20.120 Lease Rental Credit. When authorized in 
writing by the Borough Manager prior to the commencement of any 
work, the lessee may be granted credit against current or future 
lease rental, provided the work, accomplished on or off the 
leased premises, results in increased valuation of the leased 
premises or of other Borough-owned property. The authorization 
may stipulate the type of work, standards of construction and 
maximum allowable credit for the specific project. 

7.20.130 Conditional Lease. The Borough may issue a
conditional lease on property it reasonably expects it will own
or will acquire title to, prior to the actual receipt of title.
Leases issued on this conditional basis may be terminated in 
whole or in part in the event that the Borough is denied title 
to the property under lease. Prepaid lease rentals of property 
to which title is denied the Borough shall be refunded. The 
Borough shall not be liable for any claim of damages that may be 
done to the property by the lessee, or liable for any claims of 

any third party or the lessee, or for any claims that may arise 
from ownership. In the event the Borough does receive title to

Manager may provide regulations for the procedures and form as 
to applications, surveys, appraisals, auction, bidding, form and
substance of lease, termination, forfeiture or any other matter 
involving the leasing of Borough property to implement the

shall not invalidate any auction procedure or lease executed or 
to be executed by the Borough, where the requirements of the 
Chapter have been otherwise satisfied.

7.16.040. The provisions and requirements of Chapter 7.20 and 
Section 7.16.040 of this Code are not applicable to lease by the

(including the dock and staging area) and the Cold Storage 
Icehouse and Dock, or properties to be leased for use in 
providing telecommunications services within the Borough,
including but not limited to placement of a cellular tower or 
related facilities. The Assembly may authorize direct 
negotiations with a potential lessee or may prescribe a 
different procedure for lease of the properties. Any lease(s) of
the properties must be approved by resolution by the Assembly. 

7.20.160 Preference upon re-lease of Borough lands.

may, at the sole discretion of the Borough Assembly, be given a
preference to re-lease that land, with no requirement of 
competitive bidding, under the following terms and conditions:

(1) 
The lessee shall, prior to final expiration of 
the expiring lease, file an Application to re-lease that Borough 
land, on forms provided by the Borough,. The Application shall 
contain a listing of all improvements located on the land, the 
value of those improvements, the purpose to which the lessee 
desires to put the land, and such other information and 
documentation as the Borough may require.


(2) 
The initial lease rate contained in any lease 
agreement approved under this section shall be based upon
either: 


(i) 
an appraisal of the leased property 
(obtained at the lessees expense); 


(ii) 
a percentage of the gross receipts from the 
business(es) deriving income from the leased property or 
facilities located thereon;



(iii) a per client amount for the business(es) 
operating on or out of the leased property;

any other methodology approved by the 
Borough Assembly to establish the fair rental value of the

and shall, in no event, be less than the lease rate contained in 
the expiring lease. Information and documentation necessary for
the Assembly to evaluate the potential lease rates set out above 
shall be delivered by the lessee to the Borough at the time of 
submittal of the Application.


(3) 
The amount of any performance guarantee posted by 
the lessee under the expiring lease shall be adjusted
accordingly in a new lease agreement, to account for increased 
costs of removal and restoration. Borough staff shall 
investigate said costs, and report to the Assembly.


(4) 
The Application, and the additional information 
and documentation set out above, shall be delivered to the 
Assembly for its consideration. Any lease of Borough land under 
this section requires Assembly approval. If the potential 
lessee fails to execute a lease agreement offered by the Borough 
under this section within thirty days of tender of that 
agreement to the lessee, any preference opportunity shall be 
deemed forfeited, and any subsequent lease of the land will be 
subject to the Boroughs competitive bidding requirements.


(5) 
The term of any lease agreement approved under 
this section shall be no longer than ten years.


(6)

"h. Each municipal corporation receiving such 
conveyances (of tide and submerged land lying seaward of the 
Borough) shall by ordinance provide for reasonable regulations
governing the filing and processing of applications, publication
of notices and the adjudication of disputes between claimants by 
the governing body of the corporation. Any party aggrieved by 
its determination shall have a right of appeal to the Superior 
Court." 

The intent of the Assembly in enacting this is:

A. To expedite granting conveyances to qualified 
occupants who are entitled to and who exercise their preference 
rights in accordance with the provisions of law and of this 
Chapter; 

B. To provide due process and sufficient notice to
all parties, who qualify as occupants of such lands and who are
entitled to exercise preference rights, of applications filed,
disputes and conflicting claims and of approved applications; 

C. To provide simple procedures by which occupants 
may exercise their preference rights; 

D. To equitably apportion the costs of administering 
and processing applications, hearing disputes, and appraisal 
transfer and survey among those who will benefit therefrom; 

E. To limit the issues to be determined by the 
Assembly in adjudication of disputes to rights conferred by the 
Alaska Land Act and this Chapter; 

F. To safeguard and protect the interests of the 
Borough and its citizens in tide and submerged lands conveyed to 
the Borough not subject to preference rights, or where 
preference rights were or will not be exercised in the time 

allowed by law, by providing for rules and regulations for the 
administration of such lands in the best interests of all the 
taxpayers of the Borough.

has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor
of the state maps showing the pierhead line established by the

extended to persons who occupied or developed tide or submerged 
lands after September 7, 1957, and who continued to occupy the

for which the property is best adapted or could be used;

O. "Fill" shall mean earth, gravel, rock, sand or 
other similar materials placed upon tide or contiguous submerged
lands to a height above the high water line for the purpose of 
elevating the lands for a specific useful purpose. Earth, 
gravel, rock, sand or other similar materials placed on tide or

disposal shall not be considered fill unless such fill was used
for useful and beneficial purpose on and prior to January 3, 
1959;

the meaning of this Section. Fill material to the extent 
actually in place above the line of mean high tide on January 3, 
1959, and actually utilized for beneficial purposes on January
3, 1959 by the applicant shall be considered a permanent 
improvement, but in no event shall fill be considered a 
permanent improvement when placed on the tidelands solely for 
the purpose of disposing of waste or spoils. Fill material not 
utilized for a beneficial purpose on and prior to January 3, 
1959, shall not be the basis for an application, nor shall it be

permanent improvements. The holder of a permit of clearance in 
respect to interference of navigation, or of a special use 
permit from a government agency will not qualify as an 
"occupant" unless such entry on the land had, through the 
exercise of reasonable diligence, resulted in actual occupancy 
and substantial permanent improvements. No person shall be 
considered an occupant by reason of having (1) placed a fish 
trap in position for operation or storage upon the tide, shore 
or submerged land, (2) placed a set net or gill net therefor or 
any other device or facility for taking of fish, (3) placed 
pilings or dolphins for log storage or other moorage, (4) placed 
telephone, power or other transmission facilities, road, trails
or other improvements not requiring exclusive use or possession 
of tide or contiguous submerged lands, or (5) claimed the land

CC. "Preference right" subject to the classifications 
thereof herein established means the right of an occupant to 
acquire by grant, purchase or otherwise at the election of the 
occupant, except as otherwise limited or prescribed in this

boundaries of each tract occupied or developed, together with
the name of the owner or claimant thereof, including within the 
boundaries of each tract occupied or developed in the opinion of 
the Assembly for the use and enjoyment of the structures and 
improvements thereon by the owner or claimant, but shall not 
include any tide or submerged lands which if granted to such
occupant would unjustly deprive any occupant of adjoining lands 
from his reasonable use and enjoyment thereof. Tide and 
submerged lands which are not occupied or developed by the 
establishment thereon of substantial permanent improvements as 
herein defined; but which are included within the boundaries of 
subdivided tracts as being reasonably necessary in the opinion

D. That this ordinance was enacted to protect

and for conveying title to occupants holding preference rights
defined by law and this ordinance; and 

E. That copies of this ordinance are available at 
the office of the Clerk of the Borough. 

7.32.080 Time in which Applications will be Accepted 
for Filing. Application forms, in substantially the form set 
forth in Section 7.32.230 will be accepted for filing on 
November 15, 1962, and ending two calendar years thereafter and 
at the close of business at 4:30 p.m. on November 14, 1964, 
after which no application forms will be furnished and after 
which no applications will be accepted for filing. 

7.32.090 Procedure for Filing Applications.  
Applications shall be submitted and will be received for filing
only for the purpose of claiming preference rights herein 
defined to the tidelands conveyed by the State to the Borough:

A. Application forms will be provided by the Clerk 
without charge at his office in the Municipal Building; 

B. Applications must be submitted in triplicate; 

C. Applications not clearly legible, not properly
completed and certified by the applicant will not be accepted
for filing. Since the facts alleged may be used in hearing of 
disputes, their truth must be certified. The facts alleged will 

also be the basis for the conveyance of valuable property.  
Willful and deliberate misstatements of fact will be equivalent 
to attempting to obtain property under false pretenses; 

D. Applications may be delivered or mailed to the 
Clerk, Municipal Building, Yakutat, Alaska, with the proper 
deposit computed according to the nature of the application 
made. Applications property completed, accompanied with the 
proper deposit will be stamped with the time and date of filing
and signed by the person accepting the deposit. The triplicate 
copy will then be delivered to the applicant, or mailed to him
if a return envelope with postage is furnished; 

E. Any application for a deed based on an asserted
right other than a preference right shall be rejected; 

F. Any applications not waiving the Class II 
preference right shall be filed by the Clerk together with all 
others of like nature to await the official promulgation of the 
pierhead line. Thereafter such application shall be processed
as applications under the Class I rights; 

G. No single application based on more than one 
class of preference rights, except an application for a single 
subdivided lot the claim of right to which is based on more than
one class of preference right, nor any single application 
claiming title to two or more lots which are not contiguous, 
shall be accepted for filing. Such applications shall be 
rejected and delivered to the applicant, or mailed to him if a
return envelope with postage affixed is furnished. 

7.32.100 Deposits for Costs Prerequisite to Filing.  
The application form will assist the applicant in determining 
the proper costs to advance, which will depend upon the nature 
of the right claimed. In all cases a filing fee of $10.00 will 
be required. Survey costs depend upon the area claimed at the 
rate of $.0075 per square foot. If the area claimed is 
different from the lot as it appears on the plat, the applicant
shall show the measurements of the additional or lesser area 
claimed and compute and pay the different survey cost 
accordingly. Transfer costs will be the same in all cases.  
They cover the cost of time estimated to be required to examine,
process and approve the application, as well as to prepare and 
execute the deed, publish notice, give notice of additional 
costs, if any, and give notice to the applicant. In all cases 
transfer costs will be in the amount of $35.00. Deposit for 
appraisal costs will be required in all cases of Class III 
preference rights, or where another asserted right is determined
by the Assembly to be a Class III right. Appraisal costs will 
depend upon the area involved and the complexity of the 

appraisal sought. Where required as a deposit, the minimum 
amount is $25.00 but additional amounts not exceeding $25.00 may 
be required prior to delivery of deed. 


7.32.110 Additional Costs in Certain Cases. Aside 

from deposits required at the time of filing applications, 
additional costs will be required to be paid prior to hearings
where disputes require hearings, and for cost of land under a 
Class III right as well as appraisal thereof when a preference 
right sought to be exercised is determined to be a Class III 
right, as follows:

A. When the area claimed does not comply with the 
boundaries of the lot shown on the plat it is necessary to have
a hearing to establish the validity of the right claimed and 
whether it is necessary for the plat to be changed to comply 
with the application. This may require notice to be given to 
adjacent occupants interested in the difference between the 
lands claimed and land as shown on the plat so that all parties 
in interest may be heard at the hearing;

B. When applications conflict with the same area or
portions thereof it shall be necessary to conduct a hearing to 
determine the facts and the issue in question. Conflicting 
claims will be carefully scrutinized and each disputing party 
will bear the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish 
the validity of his claim;

C. The party filing an application conflicting with
a claim previously filed shall be required to deposit hearing 
costs in the amount of $25.00. If the conflict is not known at 
the time of filing, the applicant shall be advised of the 
conflict as soon as it is known and of the need to deposit the 
hearing cost deposit; 

D. The applicant who, after hearing and 
determination by the Assembly, is determined to have claimed the
land of another shall be the party to bear the cost of the 
hearing. If such party did not deposit such costs, no deed 
shall be delivered to him until the cost is paid. Where the 
depositor is the prevailing party, the hearing cost deposited 
shall be refunded to him by the Borough;

E. When title by Class III preference right is 
claimed, the applicant shall be required to deposit the 
appraised purchase price after appraisal has been made and the 
purchase price has been so determined. The same procedure will
be applied when an application under another class of right is 
sought but it is determined that the only available right to the
applicant is a Class III right; 

F. When a preference right is sought to be exercised
other than a Class III right and such right is determined to be 
a Class III right then the applicant shall be required to 
deposit the estimated cost of appraising the property claimed; 

G. The applicant who receives the deed from the 
Borough shall, at his own cost, pay for documentary stamps and 
the cost of recording the deed. 

7.32.120 Procedures for Processing Filed 
Applications. The Clerk shall cause the following procedures to 
be carried out: 

A. All copies of applications accepted for filing 
shall be stamped with time and date of filing and an application
number in chronological order of filing;

B. All original applications shall be filed in a 
permanent register and the names of the applicants entered in an 
alphabetical index which shall be a permanent part of such 
register; 

C. The application register shall be available for 
public inspection during office hours of the Clerk except when
in actual use for filing and indexing; 

D. Certified copies of all applications shall be 
prepared for all persons upon request upon their paying fifty 
cents per page for copies of said applications and any
attachments forming a part thereof; 

E. Processing of duplicate applications. The third 
copy of the application will be returned to the applicant as his
record and as receipt for deposit made, or mailed to the 
applicant if he has provided a return envelope. The second copy
shall be the working file copy to be handled and processed as
follows: 

1. 
Applications to exercise Class I preference 
rights having waivers attached and which apply for lands which 
comply with the plat with respect to area and boundary locations 
shall be transmitted to the Borough engineer for handling as 
provided in Section 7.32.140(B). Applications to exercise Class 
I preference right which do not have waivers attached,
irrespective of whether the lands applied for comply with the 
plat, shall be segregated for handling in the same manner as 
Class II preference right applications; 


2. 
Applications to exercise Class I preference 
rights having waivers attached and which claim lands which do 
not comply with the plat with respect to area and boundary 
locations shall be transmitted to the Borough engineer for 
handling as provided in Section 7.32.140(A) and further 
processing as provided in Section 7.32.170; 


3. 
Applications to exercise Class II preference 
rights shall be segregated and kept with Class I preference 
right applications not having waivers attached. All such 
applications shall be held in abeyance by the Borough until such
time as the pierhead line is established by the Corps of 
Engineers whereupon such applications shall be promptly honored
and processed in the manner herein described for Class I 
preference right applications where waivers are attached; 


4. 
Applications to exercise Class III 
preference rights, and all applications determined in whole or
in part to be Class III, shall be transmitted to the assessor
for appraisal as provided in Section 7.32.130; 


5. 
No applications which combine Class I, Class 
II and Class III, or any combination of such preference rights, 
will be accepted for filing. Any such application presented for 
filing shall be returned to the applicant for revision into two 
or more applications, each of which will apply for land under 
one type of preference right;


6. 
Applications to exercise one class of 
preference right which in part comply with the plat with respect 
to area and boundary locations, but do not wholly comply with
the plat in such respects, shall be treated as if no part of the
application so complies with the plat and shall be processed for 
contest hearing. 



7.32.130 Appraisal by Assessor --Certificate Form.  
All applications for Class III preference rights shall be 
transmitted to the assessor for appraisal. His appraisal shall 
be made on a form prepared in duplicate, the original of which
shall be attached to the application when appraised shall be 
transmitted to the Borough engineer for further processing. 

7.32.140 Review by Borough Engineer. All 
applications being ready for processing shall be reviewed by the
Borough engineer. Upon review and comparison with the plat he 
shall make his statement in duplicate as to whether or not the
application seeks to exercise a preference right to land which 
is described on the plat and complies with it in respect to area
and boundary locations, and the interest of the Borough, if any,
in the lands applied for.

A. Applications which do not conform in whole lots 
on the plat or which seek to exercise a preference right to land
in which the Borough has, or believes it has an interest, shall
be transmitted to the hearings officer for further proceedings 
under Section 7.32.180. 

B. Applications which do comply with the plat with 
respect to area and boundaries and which do not seek to exercise 
a preference right to land in which the Borough has an interest,
shall be considered approved and shall be returned to the 
Borough Clerk for further proceedings under Section 7.32.150. 

7.32.150 Processing of Approved Applications by
Clerk. All applications returned to the Clerk approved by the 
Borough engineer, and appraised by the assessor if required, 
shall be processed by the Clerk in the following manner: The 
Clerk shall ascertain if the deposit made by the applicant is 
sufficient to pay all known and estimated costs of survey, 
appraisal, transfer and purchase, if on Class III, and if not to 
advise the applicant that the remainder due shall be deposited 
with the Clerk before further processing. If or when the 
deposit is sufficient to pay all such costs, the Clerk shall 
cause to be published once a week for four weeks, in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the Borough, notice of the names of 
the applicants, the block and lot numbers of the property 
claimed according to plat designations, and if Class III, its
appraised value, and that the Borough will issue to the 
applicant(s) its deed therefor within thirty days after the date
of last publication, provided that before date of last 
publication no adverse application or claim has been filed with 
the Borough. During said period of publication, the 
applications therefor shall be returned to the Borough engineer 
who shall at the end of said period of publication note on the 
applications whether or not any adverse claims have been filed 
for the land in question. If adverse claims have been filed,
the applications shall be further processed for hearing. If no 
adverse claims have been filed, the respective applications 
shall be returned to the Clerk. 

7.32.160 Deeds -Permanent Register. The Clerk shall 
then cause to be prepared a deed conveying such land to the
applicant(s) by the Borough and transmit the deed to the Mayor 
for execution. Notice shall then be sent to the applicant to
take delivery of said deed at the office of the Clerk, who shall 
deliver the same to the applicant if all requirements have been
met and all costs including purchase rights, if required, have
been paid. Duplicate originals of all executed deeds shall be 
kept in the office of the Clerk in a permanent register entitled

its duties of adjudicating disputes between claimants of 
preference rights to tidelands, the office of hearings officer.  
He shall be appointed by the Assembly to serve without 
compensation other than an agreed part of the deposits made by 
claimants for hearing costs. His duty shall be to set disputes
for hearing and hear the evidence under oath of the parties to
the disputes. Proceedings shall be informally conducted and 
their object shall be to determine without delay the respective 
basis of the conflicting claims. Upon the submission of each 
dispute the officer shall prepare a short summary of the 
conflicting claims and the evidence submitted in support
thereof, together with his findings of fact, and conclusions of
law. This summary shall be transmitted to the Assembly for 
consideration and adjudication.

all Disputes. Upon receipt of the working files in all cases of 
disputes, and the summary of the hearings officer, together with
copies of notices of hearings served upon or mailed to all 
parties to the dispute, the Assembly shall set the dispute for 
hearings and determination, and cause notice to be served on all 
parties. Upon the Assembly having heard the dispute, it shall 
enter its ruling thereon as quickly as possible, but not later 
than ten days after the matter is submitted. Aggrieved persons 
shall have the right of appeal to the Superior Court within 
thirty days after the ruling of the Assembly is rendered.  

7.32.190 Determination upon Stipulation of Facts.  
Wherever possible to reach agreement of the parties at hearings 
before the hearings officer, a stipulation of facts shall be 
prepared and agreed upon by the parties. Where this is done,
the officer shall prepare and attach to his conclusions of law 
and submit the file to the Borough engineer to determine if the
Borough's interests are affected by the stipulation, or if a 
boundary change in the plat is necessary. If a plat boundary
change is required and no third party or Borough interests are 
affected adversely by the proposed change in boundaries of lots 
shown on the plat upon approval determined by the Borough 
engineer that the stipulation adversely affects the interest of 
the Borough or those of third parties the dispute shall be 
returned to the officer for further proceedings upon notice 
given. 

7.32.200 Rejection of Protests other than by
Applicant. No objections will be received to proposed issuance
of deed by the Borough on publication of notice thereof, nor 
will any person be permitted to appear and be heard at any
hearing of a dispute before the hearings officer or the 
Assembly, unless such objector or person is an applicant for 
preference rights of Class I, II or III and has filed an 
application therefor with the Clerk. The foregoing shall not
prevent the appearance before the hearings officer or Assembly 
of witnesses appearing on behalf of the parties to a dispute.

any excess of cost over deposits, and where the deposit exceeds 
actual costs, the excess shall be credited to present or future 
rents under the lease. All survey, appraisal and advertising 
shall be performed only under the authorization of the Borough, 
and any such work done without such authorization shall not 
qualify. 

7.32.280 Rights Prior to Leasing. The filing of an 
application for a lease shall give the applicant no right to a
lease or to the use of the land applied for. Any use not 
authorized by lease shall constitute a trespass against the 
Borough. 


7.32.290 (Repealed) 

7.32.300 Public Use. The lease of any Borough 
tidelands may be made to any state or federal agency or 
political subdivision of the state without auction and for less 
than the annual rental determined under section .340 hereunder, 
upon a finding by the borough manager, approved by the Assembly, 
that such lease is in the best interests of the Borough. 


7.32.310 Assembly Approval.  

A. A lease having a term of greater than five years
or with a computed annual rental of greater than one thousand
dollars shall first be approved by the Borough Assembly. Any
renewal period or option to renew the lease period shall be 
included in the term of the lease in computing the five-year 
period of time. 

B. No leased land may be changed in use until the 
proposed new use has been reviewed by and approved by the 
Assembly, or by the Borough Manager in the case of a lease for 
which no Assembly approval was necessary or obtained. 

7.32.320 Term of Lease. No lease shall be for a term 
of more than twenty-one years unless the Assembly shall 
determine from the purpose, use of the premises, and nature of 
improvements which may be placed thereon, that a longer term 
would benefit the Borough and would be consistent with Borough 
planning. The term of any given lease shall depend upon the 
desirability of the proposed use, the amount of investment in 
improvements proposed and made, and the nature of improvement 

proposed with respect to durability and time required to 
amortize the proposed investment.  


7.32.330 Survey and Appraisal. 

A. No tidelands shall be leased unless the same has 
been surveyed, except that in the case of a lease having a term
of five years or less, a different methodology, which adequately 
establishes the boundaries of the leased area, may be approved
by the Borough.

B. No tidelands shall be leased, or a renewal lease 
issued, unless the same has been assessed by the Borough 
Assessor. If the assessed value exceeds the sum of $30,000, the 
tidelands must be appraised prior to issuance of a lease or 
renewal lease. Appraisals shall reflect the number and value of 
Borough services rendered the land in question. The value of the 
tideland should reflect the value of its location, and such 
value may include a consideration of the financial value to be 
derived from its improvement. 


7.32.340 Annual Rental.  

A. No land shall be leased for less than the 
approved annual rental. Annual minimum rentals shall generally
be computed from the approved assessed or appraised market 
value, using a generally accepted methodology for determining 
lease values. At its option, the Borough may also provide for an
annual rental amount based upon the gross receipts from the 
business(es) deriving income from the leased property or 
facilities located thereon or adjacent thereto. 

B. The annual rental, as determined hereunder, shall 
be the lowest acceptable bid in the event of an auction. 

7.32.350 Payment of Annual Rentals. Annual rentals 
of One Thousand dollars and less shall be paid annually in 
advance. Annual rentals of any amount over One Thousand dollars 
and less than Two Thousand, Five hundred dollars shall be paid
in advance in two equal installments every six months. Annual 
rentals of any amount between Two Thousand, Five hundred one 
dollars and Five Thousand dollars shall be paid in advance in 
four equal installments each calendar quarter. Annual rentals 
exceeding Five Thousand dollars shall be paid in advance in 
twelve equal installments each calendar month. 


7.32.360 Leasing Procedure. 

A. A lease for a term of five years or less with 
computed annual rental of one thousand dollars or less may be 
negotiated directly with an applicant or offered at public 

outcry auction. All leases having a term of more than five years
or having a computed annual minimum rental of more than one 
thousand dollars shall be offered at public outcry auction. 

B. Public notice of an auction shall be provided in 
accordance with section .370 of this Chapter. 

C. At the completion of the auction of each tract of 
land the borough official conducting the auction shall indicate 
the apparent high bidder. The apparent high bidder shall, 
immediately upon conclusion of the auction, sign the lease and 
deposit with said official the portion of the annual rental then
due together with any unpaid costs of survey, appraisal and 
advertising. All payments must be made in cash, money order, 
certified check or cashier's check, or any combination thereof.
Failure to timely comply with the signatory and deposit 
requirements of this section may, at the option of the Borough,
void the apparent high bid, in which case the Borough shall 
declare the next high bidder.

D. The lease shall require submission and approval 
of a development plan for the leased property. 

7.32.370 Public Notice. When public notice of lease
of land is required to be given under the provisions of this
Chapter, thirty days notice shall be given by posting in at 
least three public places in the Borough. The notice must 
contain a brief description of the land, its area and general 
location, proposed use, term, computed annual minimum rental, 
limitations if any and the date, time and place set for the 
lease auction. 

7.32.380 Receipt of Bid. Upon deposit of the signed 
lease and required sum by the apparent high bidder, the building
official shall thereupon issue to the successful bidder a 
receipt for the required sum containing a brief description of 
the land or interest leased and the price bid. The receipt 
whereof shall be acknowledged by the bidder in writing. 

7.32.390 Borough Manager's Rejection. Prior to the 
signing of the formal lease by the Borough, the Borough Manager 
may, with or without cause, reject any and all bids for leases
when the best interest of the Borough clearly justifies such 
action. 

7.32.400 Appeal. An aggrieved bidder may appeal the
borough official's determination of the apparent high bidder to 
the Assembly, within five days (excluding Saturday and Sunday) 

following such determination. Such appeals must be in writing 
and contain a short statement of the grounds for the appeal and
be verified under oath. The Assembly may request a written 
response from the borough official and may hold a hearing on the
appeal. It shall review the asserted grounds for appeal and rule
thereon. The Assembly's decision shall be final. 

7.32.410 Completion of Bid Requirements. After 
expiration of the five-day appeal period or after the ruling by 
the Assembly if an appeal was filed, the borough official shall 
notify the successful bidder that the Borough is prepared to 
issue an appropriate lease. The bidder is granted thirty 
calendar days from the date of the notice in which to remit to 
the borough official any bid balance or any other sums that may
be due and in addition shall complete all necessary payments.  
Failure to do so shall result in forfeiture of any and all 
rights previously acquired in the proposed lease, and in 
addition, any moneys paid or deposited with the Borough shall be 
forfeited. 

7.32.420 Issuance of Lease. Following timely 
completion of any bid requirements under section .410, the 
borough official shall cause a lease to be issued and executed
containing such terms as the Assembly by its determination shall 
establish. 

7.32.430 Responsibility to Properly Locate on Leased 
Premises. It shall be the responsibility of the lessee to 
properly locate lessee and lessee's improvements and operations
on the leased land. It shall be unlawful for a lessee to 
encroach on other lands of the Borough or on lands owned or 
leased by another, and any such encroachment shall constitute a
violation of the lease, and shall subject the lease to 
termination. 

7.32.440 Lease Utilization. Leased tidelands shall be 
utilized for purposes within the terms of the lease and the 
approved development plan, and in conformity with the ordinances
of the Borough, including the zoning ordinance, and in 
substantial conformity with its comprehensive plan. Utilization 
or development for other than the allowed uses shall constitute 
a violation of the lease and subject the lease to termination.
Failure to make substantial use of the land, consistent with the 
proposed use, within one year shall, at the discretion of the 
Borough Manager, with the approval of the Assembly, constitute
grounds for termination of the lease. 

7.32.450 Adjustment of Rental. A lease having a term 
of greater than five years shall contain the agreement of the 
lessee to an adjustment of the annual rental payment by the 
Borough every fifth year, in the manner set out in the lease. 

7.32.460 Sublease or Assignment. A lessee may not 
sublease or assign the lease without Borough approval. The 
improvements on the leased lands must be the substantial reason 
for the sublease or assignment, and a lease not having 
improvements thereon shall not be sublet or assigned. Subleases 
and assignments shall be in writing, signed by the original 
lessee, the sublessee or assignee and the Borough, and be 
subject to the terms and conditions of the original lease. The 
original lessee remains liable for all duties and obligations 
under the lease, unless otherwise provided in the sublease or 
assignment. 


7.32.470 [repealed] 

7.32.480 Modification. No lease may be modified 
orally or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing
signed by all parties in interest or their successors in 
interest. 


7.32.490 Termination.  

A. Leases in good standing may be terminated in 
whole or in part at any time upon mutual written agreement of
the lessee and the Borough.

B. The Borough may, at its option, terminate a lease 
in the event of any unlawful use of the leased premises.

C. If the lessee shall default in the performance or
observance of any of the lease terms or stipulations thereto, or 
of the regulations now or hereafter in force, or any of the
ordinances of the Borough, and should said default continue for 
thirty calendar days after service of written notice by the 
Borough without remedy by lessee of the conditions warranting 
default, the Borough may terminate the lease. No improvements
may be removed by lessee or other person during any time the 
lessee is in default. The notice period may be shortened in the
event that the default presents a health or safety hazard. 

7.32.500 Notice or Demand. Any notice or demand,
which under the terms of a lease or under any statute must be 
given or made by the parties thereto, shall be in writing, and
be given or made by certified mail, addressed to the other party 

at the address of record. Either party may designate a new or
additional address of record by providing notice hereunder. A 
notice given hereunder shall be deemed delivered when deposited 
in a U. S. post office enclosed in a certified mail prepaid 
envelope addressed to the party at the party's address of 
record. 

7.32.510 Encumbrances/Rights of Deed of Trust or Lien 
Holder. 

A. A lessee may not allow any deed of trust, lien or 
other encumbrance against the lease or leased property without
the prior written consent of the Borough.

B. In the event of termination of a lease for cause, 
the holder of a properly approved and recorded deed of trust or
collateral assignment will have the option to acquire the lease
for the unexpired term thereof, upon approval by the Borough,
subject to the same terms and conditions as in the original 
lease. 

7.32.520 Entry and Re-Entry. In the event that a 
lease is terminated for cause, or in the event that the leased
lands, or any part thereof, are abandoned by the lessee during 
the said term or cease being used for the purpose for which the 
lease was sought or issued, the Borough or its agents, servants
or representative, may, immediately or any time thereafter, re­enter and resume possession of said lands or such part thereof,
and remove all persons and property therefrom either by summary 
proceedings or by a suitable action or proceeding at law without 
being liable for any damages therefor. No re-entry by the 
Borough shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of the 
lease. 

7.32.530 Re-Lease. In the event that a lease is 
terminated, the Borough may offer said lands for lease or other 
appropriate disposal pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter. 

7.32.540 Forfeiture of Rental. In the event that a 
lease is terminated for cause, the annual rental payment last
made by the lessee shall be forfeited and retained by the lessor
as partial or total damages for said breach. 

7.32.550 Written Waiver. The receipt of rent by the 
Borough with knowledge of any breach of the lease by the lessee
or of any default on the part of the lease, in observance or 
performance of any of the conditions or covenants of the lease, 
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any provision of the 

lease. No failure on the part of the Borough to enforce any
covenant or provision therein contained, nor any waiver of any 
right thereunder by the Borough unless in writing, shall 
discharge or invalidate such covenants or provisions or affect
the right of the Borough to enforce the same in the event of any
subsequent breach or default. The receipt, by the Borough, of
any rent or any other sum of money after the termination, in any 
manner, of the lease, or after the giving by the Borough of any 
notice thereunder to effect such termination, shall not 
reinstate, continue, or extend the lease, or destroy, or in any 
manner impair the efficacy of any such notice of termination as 
may have been given thereunder by the Borough to the lessee 
prior to the receipt of any such sum of money or other 
consideration, unless so agreed to in writing and signed by the 
Borough. 

7.32.560 Expiration of Lease. Unless the lease is 
renewed or sooner terminated as provided herein, the lessee 
shall peaceably and quietly leave, surrender and yield up into
the Borough all of the leased land on the last day of the term
of the lease. 


7.32.570 Renewal of Lease. The provisions of Section 

7.20.160 shall apply to renewal of leases of Borough tide and 
submerged lands. 


7.32.580 [repealed] 

7.32.590 Performance Guarantee -Removal or Reversion 

of Improvements upon Expiration or Termination of Lease ­Insurance. 

A. The Borough may require that a lessee obtain and 
maintain a performance guarantee bond under a lease, in form 
satisfactory to the Borough, in the amount estimated by the 
Borough to be necessary, upon expiration or earlier termination 
of the lease, to remove the improvements located upon the leased 
premises and to return the leased premises to their pre-lease 
condition. The amount of the required bond may be adjusted at 
five year intervals, at the option of the Borough.

B. Improvements owned by a lessee shall, within 
sixty calendar days after the expiration or termination of the 
lease, be removed by lessee, at lessee's sole expense; provided, 
such removal will not cause injury or damage to the lands; and
further provided, that the Borough may extend the time for 
removing such improvements in cases where hardship is proven. 
The lessee may, with the consent of the Borough, sell lessee's 

improvements to a succeeding lessee. All periods of time granted 
a lessee to remove improvements are subject to said lessee 
paying to the Borough pro-rata lease rentals for said period.

C. If any improvements and/or chattels having an 
appraised value in excess of fifty thousand dollars as 
determined by the Borough are not removed within the time 
allowed, such improvements and/or chattels may, upon due notice 
to the lessee, be sold at public sale under the direction of the 
Borough Manager. The proceeds of the sale shall inure to the 
lessee if lessee placed such improvements and/or chattels on the
lands, after deducting for the Borough all rents and other sums
due and owing and expenses incurred in making such sale. In case
there is no other bidder at any such sale, or the highest bid at
the sale is less than the sums owed to the Borough by lessee, 
the borough official is authorized to bid, in the name of the
Borough, on such improvements and/or chattels an amount equal to 
the sums owed the Borough. The Borough shall acquire all rights, 
both legal and equitable, that any other purchaser would acquire 
by reason of said purchase. If any such improvements and/or 
chattels are not readily and cost effectively removable from the 
lands, the Borough may, at its option, and in lieu of any such
public sale, consider said improvements and/or chattels to have
reverted to, and absolute title to have vested in, the Borough.  

D. If any improvements and/or chattels having an 
appraised value of fifty thousand dollars or less, as determined 
by the Borough, are not removed within the time allowed, such
improvements and/or chattels shall, at the option of the 
Borough, revert to, and absolute title shall vest in, the 
Borough. 

E. The lessee shall obtain policies of insurance, in 
types and limits, and in such forms, as may be required by the 
Borough, The Borough shall be a named insured on such policies
of insurance, and/or said insurers shall waive all rights of 
subrogation against the Borough. The required limits of such 
policies may be adjusted at five year intervals, at the option 
of the Borough. 

7.32.600 Rental for Improvements or Chattels not 
Removed. Any improvements and/or chattels belonging to the 
lessee or placed on the lease during the lessee's tenure with or
without lessee's permission and remaining upon the premises
after the expiration or termination of the lease shall entitle 
the Borough to charge a reasonable rent therefor. Receipt of 
rental hereunder shall not reinstate, continue, or extend the 
lease. 

7.32.610 Sanitation. The lessee shall comply with 
all regulations or ordinances of the Borough which are 
promulgated for the promotion of sanitation. The premises of the 
lease shall be kept in a neat, clean, sanitary condition and 
every effort shall be made to prevent the pollution of waters. 

7.32.620 Building and Zoning Codes. Leased lands 
shall be utilized in accordance with the building and zoning 
ordinances and rules and regulations of the Borough and any 
other authority having jurisdiction. Failure to do so shall 
constitute a violation of the lease and shall subject the lease 
to termination. 

7.32.630 Fire Protection. The lessee shall take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent, and take all necessary action 
to suppress, destructive or uncontrolled grass, brush or other
fires on leased lands and comply with all laws, regulations and 
rules promulgated by the Borough, or other authority having 
jurisdiction, for fire protection within the area wherein the 
leased premises are located. 

7.32.640 Inspection. The lessee shall allow 
authorized representatives of the Borough to enter the leased 
land for inspection during regular business hours upon 24 hours
notice. 

7.32.650 Personal Use of Materials. Unless otherwise 
stated in a lease, the lease is for surface use only. No surface 
or subsurface material may be removed from the leased premises
by lessee. Specifically, all coal, oil, gas, gas liquids, other
minerals, timber, and all deposits of sand, stone, rock, gravel,
top soil, and peatmoss are excepted from the operation of a 
surface lease, and the lessee shall not sell or remove for use
elsewhere any such material; provided, however, that material
required for the development of the leasehold may be used, if 
its use is first approved by the Borough. 

7.32.660 Easements and Rights-of-Way. The Borough 
expressly reserves the right to grant easements or rights-of-way 
across leased land if it is determined in the best interest of 
the Borough to do so. Annual rentals may be adjusted, at the 
discretion of the Borough, to compensate lessee for loss of use 
caused by the granting of any such easement or right-of-way. 


7.32.670 Restrictions and Reservations. The lease 

shall contain such restrictions and reservations as are 
necessary to protect the public interest. 

7.32.680 Damages. Any person, firm or corporation 
who has since January 3, 1959 removed any gravel, rock or other
material comprising the tide and submerged land granted to the 
Borough by the State by the said conveyance dated February 7, 
1962, and has used the same for the placement of fill on any of 
such tide and submerged lands shall be liable to the Borough for
the fair value of such material. 

7.32.690 Waste and Injury to Land. The lessee shall 
not commit or permit waste or trespass or other injury upon the 
leased premises or other Borough land. Failure to comply with 
this provision shall constitute a violation of the lease and 
shall subject the lease to termination. The lessee shall be 
liable for all damages sustained by the Borough due to the waste
and injury to land. 

7.32.700 Warranty. The Borough does not warrant by 
its classification or leasing of land, or approval of a 
development plan, that the land is suited for the use authorized 
under said classification, lease or plan, and no guaranty is 
given or implied that it shall be profitable to employ land to
said use. 

7.32.710 Lease Rental Credit. When authorized in 
writing by the Borough prior to the commencement of any work, 
the lessee may be granted credit against current or future rent, 
provided, said work, accomplished on or off the leased area, 
results in increased valuation of other Borough owned lands.  
Said authorization may stipulate type of work, standards of 
construction and the maximum allowable credit for the specific 
project. 

7.32.720 Approval of Other Authorities. The issuance 
by the Borough of a deed or lease under the provisions of this
Chapter does not relieve the lessee of responsibility for 
obtaining licenses or permits as may be required by duly 
authorized state, federal or other agency having jurisdiction
over the leased premises or the use to be made of the leased 
premises. 

7.32.730 Sale of Certain Tide and Submerged Lands.  
When it is in the public interest, the Assembly may by 

resolution authorize the sale of small tracts of tidelands and 
submerged lands, provided that no such tract shall be greater in 
area than four hundred square feet, such tract is unsuitable for 
use as a public use area, and such tract cannot be leased. All 
sales of tidelands and submerged lands shall be public sales and 
shall be governed by the provisions of this Chapter, insofar as 
may be applicable. The assessed or appraised value of the 
property shall be stated in the notice required by Section 

7.32.370 instead of the annual minimum rental. The Assembly may
provide additional requirements not inconsistent with this 
Chapter in the resolution authorizing such sale. 

7.32.740 Removal of Material without Authorization. 
Any person or business entity who, without written authority 
from the Borough, removes rock, sand, stone, gravel or any other 
material, including those minerals and materials specifically
set forth in section .650 above, from Borough tide and submerged 
lands shall be guilty of a violation and subject to a fine of 
$500. Each day such violation is committed or permitted to 
continue shall constitute a separate offense. The person or 
entity shall also be civilly liable to the Borough for trespass
and other damages caused by the unauthorized removal of 
material. 

7.32.750 No Deed or Lease Grants Right to Remove 
Material. No deed or lease granted by the Borough to any person 
shall contain terms to be construed as granting any right to 
remove any material from Borough tide and submerged lands after 
January 3, 1959. 

7.32.760 Application to Remove Material for the 
Public Interest. In recognition that conditions may exist from 
time to time whereby removal of material from Borough tide and 
submerged lands may be beneficial to the public interest and 
promote the progress and development of the Borough, 
applications for the removal thereof may be received and 
considered by the Assembly providing such applications fully 
disclose to the Borough all material facts and plans for the 
proposed use. Disposition of such applications shall be made by 
the Assembly and any disposition granting any right or interest
to remove material shall be made by resolution of the Assembly
after consideration and finding that such disposition shall be
in the best interest of the general public. The applicant shall 
be responsible for obtaining all required permits and approvals. 

7.32.770 Penalties. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed guilty of a violation 
and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in the amount of five 
hundred dollars. Each day such violation is committed or 
permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and 
shall be punishable as such hereunder. 

7.32.780 Severability Clause. If any section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter 
is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court 
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a 
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding 
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. 

7.32.790 Effective Date. This ordinance shall be 
published by number and title within ten days after its passage 
and shall become effective on September 30, 1962, thirty days
after its passage and publication. Subsequent amendments shall
be effective as of the date of the ordinance adopting the 
amendment, or as otherwise stated therein. 

7.32.800 Lease or Disposal. The Borough may by
ordinance provide for lease or disposal of the Multi-Purpose 
dock, the Ocean Cape dock and the Cold Storage dock, and any 
tide and submerged lands containing the docks, and adjacent

1. A structure, construction, alteration or repair 
of a structure, or use or occupancy of land or a structure, that
conflicts with a provision of this chapter or a term or 
condition of a permit or other entitlement issued under this 
title, is a violation.

2. A violator is a person who:

a. 
occupies, maintains, alters, constructs or 
establishes a structure, or use of land or a structure, in 
violation of this title; or


b. 
owns, controls or has the right to control 
land or a structure where a structure, or use of land or a 
structure, is occupied, maintained, altered, constructed or 
established in violation of this title. 



C. Enforcement Orders. 

1. 
If the Zoning Administrator shall find that a 
violation has occurred, he shall notify the person responsible
for such violation in writing, including the nature of the 
violation, and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He 
shall order discontinuance of illegal uses of land, buildings or 
structures; removal of illegal buildings or structures or of 
additions, alterations or structural changes thereto; 
discontinuance of any illegal work being done; revocation or 
suspension of any permit or entitlement issued under this title 
under the authority, or purported authority, of which a 
violation of this title is occurring; the restoration of any 
structure, vegetation, land, water body or other thing upon the
land that is destroyed, damaged, altered or removed in violation

jurisdiction for recovery of a civil penalty and/or, any other 
action authorized by this title to insure compliance with or to 
prevent violation of its provisions.

within 15 days of its service. If such an appeal is timely 



filed with the Planning Commission, the enforcement order shall 
be deemed final upon the Commission's issuance of a decision on 
the matter. An enforcement order need not be issued before 
legal action is commenced with respect to a violation, and the 
pendency of any proceeding regarding an enforcement order issued
does not stay any other legal action with respect to the 
violation which is the subject of the enforcement order.

occurs, any person may file a complaint in regard thereto. All 
such complaints shall be brought to the attention of the Zoning

Each and every day that a violation is continued 
shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation.



3. The Borough may bring a civil action to:

a. Enjoin or abate the violation; 

b. 
Require the restoration of any structure, 
vegetation, land, water body or other thing upon that land that
is destroyed, damaged, altered or removed in violation of this 
title; 


c. 
Recover damages suffered because of the 
violation; and 


d. 
In addition to injunctive or compensatory 
relief, recover a civil penalty in the amount specified in 
subparagraph 1. above.



4. 
Whenever an enforcement order has become final, 
as specified in (C)(2) above, and the violation continues to 
exist, the zoning administrator may bring an action to enforce 
the compliance order. A judgment entered in that action shall 
include the daily amount of civil penalties payable through the 
date of entry.

Any building or structure set up, erected, built, 
or moved, or any use of property contrary to the provisions of
this Chapter shall be declared to be unlawful and a public 
nuisance and the Borough Assembly may immediately commence 
action for the removal thereof, in the manner provided by law,

8.20.030 Non-conforming use of land. 

8.20.040 Non-conforming structure. 

8.20.050 Non-conforming use of structure. 

8.20.010 Non-conformities --Definitions and Intent. When 
a lot, structure or use legally exists prior to the original 
effective date of applicable regulations but would be 
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this 
Title, or future amendments thereto, it shall be permitted to 
continue within the limits set forth in this Chapter. Under 
such circumstances, it is said to have "non-conforming" status. 
There are four types of non-conforming status:

1. 
Non-conforming lot of record. The lot width or 
area or both is smaller than the minimum permitted in the zone 
in which it is located; 


2. 
Non-conforming use of land. The use to which the 
land is being put is not a principal, accessory or conditional 
use permitted in the zone in which it is located, and is not 
otherwise permitted in this Title.  


3. 
Non-conforming structure. The structure fails to 
meet yard, coverage or height regulations or other development
requirements established for the zone in which it is located;


4. 
Non-conforming use of structure. The use to 
which the structure or the structure and land in combination is 
being put is not a principal, accessory or conditional use 
permitted in the zone in which it is located, and is not 
otherwise permitted in this Title. 



It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these non­conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to 
encourage their perpetuation. Non-conforming uses are declared 
by this Chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the 
zones involved. It is further the intent of this Chapter that 
non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or 
extended, nor shall they be used as grounds for adding other 
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. 

8.20.020 Non-conforming lot of record. In any zone in 
which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding 
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Title, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected
on any single lot which is of record at the effective date of 
the original adoption or amendment of applicable regulations.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area, width, or both that are generally 
requirements applicable in the zone. Variance of yard
requirements and of other development requirements except as 
specified above shall be obtained only through action of the 
Planning Commission as provided in Chapter 8.24. 

8.20.030 Non-conforming use of land. Where, at the 
original effective date of applicable regulations, lawful use of
land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms 
of this Title as enacted or amended, such use may be continued,
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following 
provisions:

A. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or 
increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied at the original effective date of adoption or amendment
of the relevant regulations;

B. If such non-conforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than twenty-four consecutive months, 
any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations 
specified by this Title for the zone in which such land is 
located. 

8.20.040 Non-conforming structure. Where a lawful 
structure exists at the original effective date of applicable 
regulations, that would not be allowed in the zone under the 
terms of this Title as enacted or amended, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the 
following provisions:

A. No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or 
altered in a way which increases its non-conformity, but any 
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its non­conformity;

B. A residential structure in a residential zone may be 
enlarged so long as the addition to the structure conforms to 
all the requirements set forth in this Title;

C. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any 
distance whatever it shall thereafter conform to the regulations
for the zone in which it is located after it is moved; 

D. Should such non-conforming structure or non­conforming portion of a structure be damaged by any means to an
extent of more than fifty percent of its replacement cost at 
time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in 
conformity with the provisions of this Title. 

8.20.050 Non-conforming use of structure. Where, at the
original effective date of applicable regulations, lawful use of
a structure exists that is made no longer permissible under the 
terms of this Title as enacted or amended, such use may be 
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to 
the following provisions:

A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted 
by this Title in the zone in which it is located shall be 
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or 
structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure
to a use permitted in the zone in which it is located; 

B. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any 
part of a building which was manifestly arranged or designed for 
such use at the time of original adoption of applicable 
regulations, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any 
land outside such building;

C. A non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and 
premises, may be changed to another non-conforming use provided 
that the Planning Commission shall find that the proposed use is 
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the zone than the 
existing non-conforming use; 

D. Any structure, or structure and land in combination,
in or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted
use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in 
which such structure is located, and the non-conforming use may 
not thereafter be resumed;

E. When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure 
and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 
twenty-four consecutive months, the structure, or structure and
land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in 
conformance with the regulations of the zone in which it is 
located.

prescribed by the Borough, and must contain detailed and 

specific allegations of the alleged error in the Administrator's
decision. 

8.24.020 Conditional Use Permit -Intent. There are 
some uses which, either because of their potential impact on 
neighboring properties or because of their public service 
nature, should receive Planning Commission review in each case.  
These conditional uses are specified within Sections .080

this Chapter and Title. A grant for the request of a conditional 
use permit shall require an affirmative vote of a majority of 
the fully constituted Commission. The Planning Commission's 
decision and the reasons therefore shall be entered in the 
records of the Commission and shall be available to the public.

J. In granting a conditional use permit, the Planning

Commission may impose such conditions to its continued validity
as may be necessary, in the Planning Commission's judgment, to 
assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and 
policies appropriate for consideration by the Planning 
Commission. The Planning Commission may limit the duration of a 
permit by a fixed or definable period of time, or a period 
limited to continued ownership or use of the property.

L. Unless the Commission specifies otherwise, approval of 
a conditional use permit shall automatically expire 18 months

dedications, and vacations of land; (2) dimensions and design of
lots; (3) street width, arrangement, and rights-of-way, 
including requirements for public access to lots and 
installation of street paving, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, 
sewers, water lines, drainage and other public utility
facilities and improvements; (4) dedication of streets, rights­of-way, public utility easements and areas considered necessary
by the platting authority for other public uses.

B. The Planning Commission is hereby established as the
platting authority to administer subdivision regulations and to
perform other duties as required by this Title and by the 
Assembly. 

8.28.020 Plat Recordation. If the Platting Authority 
approves a final plat, or an alteration, replat or vacation 
petition, the plat shall be acknowledged and filed in accordance 
with AS 40.15.010 through 40.15.020, and is thereafter the 
lawful plat. 

8.28.030 Purpose. The purpose of the subdivision 
regulations set out herein is to promote and improve the health, 
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and 
Borough of Yakutat. These regulations are designed to encourage 
the orderly development and use of land; to prevent congestion 
of streets and highways; to provide for adequate transportation, 

water, sewage, schools, parks, and other public facilities; to
provide adequate light and air; and to increase public safety
from fire, disease, and other dangers. These regulations are 
designed to achieve the greatest economy to the City and Borough 
of Yakutat and its citizens while protecting the public 
interests involved in the subdivision of land within the 
Borough. 

8.28.040 Scope. The subdivision regulations shall not 
apply to any lot forming a part of a subdivision legally created
and filed for record prior to the original effective date of 
these regulations, unless the lot is further subdivided or 
resubdivided. Where these regulations impose a greater
restriction upon land than is imposed or required by existing
provisions of other laws, ordinances or regulations, or with 
private restrictions placed upon property by deed, restrictive 
covenants, or other private agreements running with the land, 
the provisions of these regulations shall prevail.

subdivision of land within the City and Borough of Yakutat. 

8.28.060 Alteration, Replat or Vacation Petition. A 
recorded plat shall not be altered or replatted, and a platted 
street shall not be vacated, except in conformance with Section 

8.36.040. 


8.28.070 Title to Vacated Area.  

A. The title to the street or other public area vacated 
on a plat attaches to the lot or lands bordering the area in 
equal proportions, except that if the area was originally 
dedicated by different persons, original boundary lines shall be
adhered to so that the street area that lies on one side of the 
boundary line shall attach to the abutting property on that 
side, and the street area that lies on the other side of the 
boundary line shall attach to the property on that side. The 
portion of a vacated street that lies inside the limits of a 
platted addition attaches to the lots of the platted addition
bordering on the area. If a public square is vacated, the title 
to it vests in the Borough if it lies inside the Borough. If 
the property vacated is a lot, title vests in the rightful 
owner. 

B. If the Borough acquired the street or other public
area vacated for legal consideration or by express dedication to 
the Borough other than as a subdivision platting requirement,
before the the final act of vacation the fair market value of 

the street or public area shall be deposited with the platting
authority to be paid to the Borough on final vacation. 


8.28.080 Variances from subdivision regulations.  

A. There are a few instances when the strict application 
of subdivision regulations would result in exceptional hardship.  
It is the purpose of a variance to grant relief from such 
exceptional hardship.

B. Required standards for the granting of variances under
this section, as well as the procedures for securing variances, 
are contained in Chapter 8.24. 


8.28.090  Penalties. 

A. It is unlawful for the owner or agent of the owner of
land located in a subdivision to transfer, sell, offer to sell,

plat of the subdivision has been prepared, approved, and filed 
in accordance with this Title. It is unlawful for a person to 
file a plat or other document depicting subdivided land in a 
public recorder's office unless the plat or document has been
approved by the Platting Authority. For a violation of a 
provision of this Title, a subdivision regulation adopted under 
this Title, or a term, condition, or limitation imposed by the 
Platting Authority in the exercise of its powers under this 
Title, a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 may be imposed. A 
separate $1,000 penalty may be imposed, if applicable, for each
lot or parcel transferred, sold, or included in an offer or 
contract to be sold. Each and every day that a violation is 
continued shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. An 
action to enjoin a violation may be brought notwithstanding the 
availability of any other remedy.  

B. The Borough or an aggrieved person may institute a 
civil action against a person who violates a provision of this
Title, a subdivision regulation adopted under this Title or a 
term, condition or limitation imposed by a platting authority.

The approval of a preliminary plat does not 
constitute approval of the subdivision or the acceptance of any
dedication within the subdivision, but only authorizes the 
applicant to proceed to prepare final plat. Application for 
approval of a final plat, including any final plat submitted 
under a phased development master plan, may be submitted only
after approval of the preliminary plat, and only while the 
approval of the preliminary plat remains effective.


2. 
Approval of a preliminary plat expires twenty-
four months after its issuance, unless the Platting Authority 
extends its duration at the request of the applicant. The 
Platting Authority may approve an extension only if it finds 
that the conditions supporting approval of the preliminary plat
have not materially changed. A subdivider may proceed upon an 
expired preliminary plat only by reapplying for a preapplication
conference in accordance with Section 8.36.010. 



8.36.030 Final Plat. After approval of the preliminary 
plat, and after compliance with any and all conditions on the 
approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit a
final plat for approval.

A. Requirements: The final plat shall be drawn on high-
quality reproducible material and be at least eighteen inches 

(18") by twenty-four inches (24") in size. All lines and 
printing shall be made with non-fading black ink, using a scale 
of one hundred feet (100') to the inch unless otherwise 
specified by the Platting Authority. Information shown on the 
plat will include:

1. The date, scale, and north arrow. 

2. 
The initial point of survey, original, or re­established corners and their description; actual traverse 
showing area of closure and all distances, angles, and 
calculations required to determine initial point, corner, and 
distances of the plat; the exact length and bearing of the 
exterior boundaries of the subdivision; and all monuments as 
required in this Title;


3. 
Within the subdivision, the final plat shall show 
the center lines of all streets; lengths, tangents, radii, and 
central angles of all curves; the total width of each street; 
the width of the portion being dedicated and the width of the
existing dedications together with the width of portions of 
streets each side of the center line; and, the width of rights­of-way of railroads, patent reserves, section line easements, 
flood control and drainage channels, and any other easements 
appearing on the plat;


4. 
The width, bearing, and other data necessary to
delineate all easements to which the lots are subject. If the 
easement is not definitely located on the record, a statement 
referring to the easement shall appear on the plat. Easements 
for storm drains, sewers, utilities, and other purposes shall be 
denoted by broken lines;


5. 
The exact boundaries of all areas to be dedicated 
or reserved for public use or for the common use of property

subject to the condition that the improvements will be completed 
within twenty-four months after approval of the final plat. If 
completed, the Borough will return the full amount of the 
guarantee to the subdivider; if not completed, the Borough may 
complete construction of the improvements with the guarantee.

reconstruction, repair, or maintenance of the improvements 
during the one (1) year warranty period. Any amount of the 
maintenance guarantee in excess of the costs of correction, 
reconstruction, repair or maintenance will be returned to the 
subdivider.

8.48.020 	Definitions. 

8.48.030 	Land to which this Chapter applies.

8.48.050 	Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. 

8.48.060 	Severability. 

8.48.010 Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and 
purpose. The Assembly of the City and Borough of Yakutat,
Alaska, does recognize that the Borough is periodically subject 
to flooding, and erosion, furthermore, both hazards may result
in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, and 
public expenditures for flood protection, relief and erosion 
control, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety 
and general welfare. This purpose of this Chapter is to promote
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize flood 
losses. To accomplish this purpose, it is the intent of this
Chapter to:

A. Encourage land uses vulnerable to floods or erosion be 
protected against flood damages at the time of initial 
construction or substantial improvement;

B. Modify land uses which are dangerous to health, safety 
or property in time of flood or cause excessive increase in 
flood heights or velocity;

C. Insure that subdivision and development of land within 
the city are consistent with the need to minimize flood hazards;
and ensure that the sale of flood insurance is available to 
residents, and that those who occupy the areas of special flood 
hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

special flood hazard.

D.

such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in 
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of
this Ordinance. 

F. 
"MANUFACTURED HOME" means a structure, transportable 
in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis

damage occurred.

J. 
"SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT" means any repair, 
reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the 
structure either: 


1. before the improvement or repair is started, or 


2. 
if the structure has been damaged, and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. 



For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, 
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building 
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term can exclude, at the 
discretion of the Local Administrator, a) any project for 
improvement of a structure to correct pre-cited existing 
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been previously identified by the

Chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the 
jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Yakutat. Until such 
time as a "Flood Insurance Study" and "Flood Insurance Maps" are 
published by the Federal Insurance Administration for the City 
and Borough of Yakutat, the Borough shall reasonably utilize the 
High Water Marks of Record. 

8.48.040 Administration. 

A. Development Permit Required. A development permit 
shall be obtained before construction or development begins to
determine if such development is proposed within flood-prone 
areas. The permit shall be for all structures, including 
manufactured homes, and for all development including fill and
other activities. 

B. Designation and Duties of the Local Administrator.  
The Borough Planner is hereby appointed to administer and 
implement this Chapter by granting or denying development permit
applications in accordance with its provisions. Duties of the 
Borough Planner shall include, but not be limited to:

1. 
Review all development permits to determine if 
the proposed development is located in a flood hazard area.


2. 
Review all development permits to determine that 
all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, 
State, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval
is required.


3. 
Review all development permits to determine if 
the proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from 
flooding. 


4. 
Maintain for public inspection all records 
pertaining to the provisions of this Chapter. 


5. 
Where base flood elevation data or High Water 
Marks of Record are provided, obtain and record the actual 
elevation of the lowest floor of all structures; and if 
applicable, elevation to which any non-residential structure has 
been flood proofed. 



8.48.050 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. 

A. General Standards. If a proposed building site is in 
a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial 
improvements shall meet the following standards:

1. Anchoring. Be designed and adequately anchored 
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the 
structure; all manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to 
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Anchoring 
methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top 
or frame ties to ground anchors. (44 CFR 60.3(b)(8)). For more 
detailed information, refer to guidebook, FEMA-85, "Manufactured
Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas." 

2. Construction Materials and Methods. 

a. 
All new construction and substantial 
improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility 
equipment resistant to flood damage.


b. 
All new construction and substantial 
improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices 
that minimize flood damage.


c. 
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, 
air condition, and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions
of flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood 
elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be 
increased. 


3. Utilities. 


a. 
All new and replacement water supply systems 
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood 
waters into the system.


b. 
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems 
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood 
waters into the systems and discharge into flood waters; sewage 
lift station electrical panels shall be elevated above High
Water Marks. 


4. Residential Construction. 


a. 
In all flood prone areas, new construction 
and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall
have the lowest floor elevated to or above base flood elevation 
if established, or the high water marks of record. 


b. 
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor 
that are subject to flooding are prohibited or shall be designed
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs 
for meeting this requirement must be either be certified by a 
registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or 
exceed the following minimum criteria:



(i) 
A minimum of two openings having a 
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square 
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.


(ii) 
The bottom of all openings shall be no 
higher than one foot above grade. 



(iii) Openings may be equipped with 
screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that
they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

(iv) 
be used solely for parking of vehicles, 
building access, or storage.


(v) 
Below grade, crawlspaces are prohibited 
at sites where the velocity of floodwaters exceeds five (5) feet
per second. 


(vi) 
All building utility systems within the 
crawlspace shall be elevated above base flood elevation or be
designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within
the system component during flood conditions. 



(vii) The interior of a crawlspace below 
the base flood elevation must not be more than 2 feet below the 

lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG) and the height of the below 
grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the 
crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation must not 
exceed 4 feet at any point. 

(viii) Below grade, crawlspaces 
constructed in accordance with the requirements listed in this 
subsection shall not be considered basements. However, 
applicants who construct buildings that have below grade 
crawlspaces are hereby advised that such buildings will have 
higher flood insurance premiums than buildings that have 
crawlspaces with interior elevations at or above the lowest 
adjacent grade. 5. 

Nonresidential Construction. New construction and 
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other
nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor 
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation or 
high water marks of record; or, together with attendant utility 
and sanitary facilities shall:

a. 
Be flood proofed so that below the base 
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water.


b. 
Be certified by a registered professional 
engineer or architect that the design and methods of 
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of 
practice for meeting provisions of this section and such 
certifications shall be provided to the Borough Manager.


c. 
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor 
in nonresidential elevated structures that are subject to 
flooding need be designed to allow for the entry and exit of 
flood waters, or are prohibited.



6. 
Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes in 
the floodplain to be placed or substantially improved on sites 
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest 
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base 
flood elevation (BFE) or high water marks of record and be 
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.


7. 
Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles 
placed on sites are required to either:



a. 
Be on the site for fewer than 180 
consecutive days; or


b. 
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use,
on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no 
permanently attached additions; or 


c. 
Meet the requirements of 8.48.050(4) above 
and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured 
homes. 



B. Subdivision Proposals.

1. 
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent 
with the need to minimize flood damage.


2. 
All subdivision proposals shall have public 
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and 
water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.


3. 
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate 
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.



C. Review of Building Permits. Where flood elevation 
data is not available either through a Flood Insurance Study or 
from another authoritative source, applications for building
permits will be reviewed to assure proposed construction will be 
reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a 
local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water
marks, photographs of past flooding, where available. Failure 
to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may
result in higher insurance rates. 

8.48.060 Severability. If any section, clause, sentence, 
or phrase of this Ordinance is held to be invalid or 
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then 
said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the 
remaining portions of this Ordinance.

8.52.010 	Purpose and intent. 

(A) 
It is the purpose of this chapter to foster the 
development of a safe, healthy and environmentally sound mining 
industry while protecting the overall interests of public 
health, safety and the general welfare and minimizing the 
environmental and surface effects of mining projects for which
an exploration notice or mining permit is required. This chapter 
establishes the review and permit procedures necessary to 
conduct exploration, to gain approval to open a mine, to conduct 
mining operations, and to provide for final reclamation and 
financial warranty release at the conclusion of exploration and 
mining operations and reclamation of affected surface. This 
chapter does not include regulation of surface or subsurface 
water, geothermal resources, gravel, common varieties of 
construction aggregate, or natural oil, gas, coal and peat or 


associated by-products recovered therewith, except to the extent 
that such substances are developed or extracted as a mining by­product in a mining operation.


(B) 
The intent of this chapter is to regulate areas of 
local concern, reserving to the Borough all regulatory powers 
not preempted by state or federal law. The Borough may require a
permit to be obtained or a notice given for federally approved
activities on federal lands, including unpatented mining claims,
so long as the purpose of the review process is not to deny use 
or expressly prohibit mining, but rather the purpose of the 
review is to impose conditions for the protection of the 
environment, health, safety and general welfare of the Borough. 



8.52.020 Exploration notices and grants of authority, 
financial warranties and procedures, release of financial 
warranties for exploration notices.

(A) 
In order to ensure that exploration is conducted in 
accordance with the environmental, health, safety and general 
welfare concerns of the Borough, any operator intending to 
conduct or continue exploration operations other than pursuant
to a previously filed exploration plan shall file with the 
Borough a notice of its intent to conduct exploration 
activities, and provide a financial warranty in the amount 
established by the Department. Such notice shall identify, on a 
map of a scale of 1:63,360, the area of and schedule for the 
exploration activities. The notice shall also describe the 
operator's plan for reclamation of the areas disturbed by its 
exploration activities and shall contain information as to the
methodology and cost of such reclamation sufficient to enable 
the Department to determine an appropriate financial warranty. 
The notice shall also contain copies of any prospecting permits,
notice of intent to conduct exploration, or operating plans 
filed with any federal or state agency, with all modifications, 
revisions and amendments thereto. In conducting exploration 
operations, the operator shall comply with all applicable 
federal, state and borough laws, rules and regulations, 
including but not limited to section 8.52.050, and such 
compliance shall be a condition of the effectiveness of the 
authority to operate under an exploration notice.


(B) 
Upon completion of exploration activities, and all 
necessary reclamation, the operator shall notify the Borough
that exploration and reclamation are complete and shall submit a
map on a scale of 1:63,360 showing the location of the 
exploration and reclamation activities. The Department shall 
determine whether an inspection of the lands explored is 
necessary to determine whether reclamation has been properly 



completed and, if so, shall inspect the lands explored and 
reclaimed within 60 days of such notification or as soon 
thereafter as weather conditions permit. In determining whether
an inspection is necessary, the Borough shall consider whether
there has been a state or federal inspection and whether that
inspection fulfills the requirements of this section and section

8.52.050. If the Department finds that the reclamation satisfies
the standards of subsection 8.52.050(B), the financial warranty 
shall be promptly released. If it finds that the standards have
not been satisfied, it shall notify the operator within 30 days
of the inspection, or the review of other agency records, of the
additional steps necessary to achieve compliance with subsection 
8.52.050(B). The Department shall give the operator a reasonable
time to complete reclamation and request another inspection, in 
which case the inspection, or review of other agency records,
shall be repeated. If the Department, after such inspection or 
review, is not satisfied that the standards of subsection 
8.52.050(B) have been complied with, it may declare so much of 
the financial warranty as necessary forfeited and, after notice 
thereof and an opportunity for the operator to appeal pursuant
to section 8.52.100, apply the financial warranty to complete 
reclamation. 

(C) The requirement of a financial warranty may be waived 
if the Department determines that a financial warranty is not 
necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this 
chapter. The waiver shall be in writing and shall set for the
reasons for the waiver. 

8.52.030 Small mine permits, financial warranties and 
procedures.

(A) 
No new small mine shall commence mining operations
after February 1, 2009, unless the operator shall have obtained
a small mine permit pursuant to this chapter. No small mine 
which is in operation on February 1, 2009 may remain in 
operation more than one year thereafter, unless the operator has 
submitted a permit application and the permit has not been 
denied. 


(B) 
A small mine permit application shall include 
information establishing the right to use the affected surface,
a map showing the location of the small mine and the affected
surface for that small mine on a scale of 1:63,360 or a more
detailed scale, a description and timetable of the mining 
operation, including the mining plan, the plan for reclamation
and the potential environmental, health, safety and general 
welfare impacts of the operation, and other information 
reasonably requested by the Borough. The application shall also 


require a description of the measures to be taken to mitigate
the adverse effects of such impacts, to mitigate adverse effects 
of mining operations on neighboring land, and to comply with 
section 8.52.050. The application shall additionally include a 
listing of all permits applied for or granted by other agencies
as well as amendments to those other applications as they are 
filed. To the extent that the information required by this 
subsection is provided in applications to other agencies, the 
operator may respond on its application form by cross reference 
to the relevant portions of those applications, which shall be 
attached thereto. The requirement to provide information is 
continuing, and supplemental information regarding any changes 
in the information submitted must be provided to the Borough 
throughout the duration of the application process.


(C) 
Upon receipt of an application, and the processing fee 
set out in section 8.44.040, the Department shall review the 
application, and within 35 days make a recommendation as to 
whether the proposed mining operation will mitigate adverse 
environmental, health, safety and general welfare impacts. This 
review shall include, but not be limited to, the following 
determinations: whether air and water quality standards will be 
maintained in accordance with federal, state, and borough laws, 
rules and regulations; whether sewage, solid waste, hazardous 
and toxic materials will be properly contained and disposed of 
in accordance with federal, state and borough laws, rules and 
regulations; whether the mining operation will be conducted in 
such a way as to minimize safety hazards to the extent 
reasonably practicable and to mitigate adverse impacts on the 
public and on neighboring properties such as those from traffic,
noise, dust, unsightly visual aspects, surface subsidence, 
avalanches, landslides and erosion; and whether appropriate 
historic sites designated by the Borough as significant will be 
protected. If the Department makes a favorable recommendation,
it will also make a recommendation on the amount of the 
financial warranty as provided in section 8.52.060. The 
Department's recommendations shall be forwarded to the Borough
Planning Commission where the matter shall be placed on the 
agenda for the next regularly scheduled meeting after notice has 
been published as provided in section 8.44.030. If the 
Commission determines that the application, with stipulations or 
conditions as appropriate, satisfies the standards of this 
chapter, including section 8.52.050, it shall approve the 
application and set the amount of financial warranty pursuant to 
section 8.52.060. When the operator has submitted a financial 
warranty in the amount set by the Commission and in a form 


satisfactory to the Borough, the permit shall be promptly issued 
by the Department.


(D) 
If the Department determines that the proposed mining
operations does not meet the standards of this chapter, 
including section 8.52.050, it shall so advise the operator, 
stating the reasons therefore. The operator may then either 
allow the Department's recommendation to be forwarded to the 
Commission pursuant to subsection (C) of this section, or revise
its plans, if appropriate, and resubmit the application for 
processing in accordance with subsection (C) of this section. If 
the application is resubmitted within 180 days of the initial 
submission, no new processing fee will be required. 



8.52.040 Large mine permits, financial warranties and 
procedures.

(A) 
No new large mine shall commence mining operations
after February 1, 2009, unless the operator shall have obtained
a large mine permit pursuant to this chapter. No large mine 
which is in operation on February 1, 2009 may remain in 
operation more than one year thereafter, unless the operator has 
submitted a permit application and the permit has not been 
denied. 


(B) 
The permit application shall be submitted in the form 
of a report containing sufficient information so that the 
Borough can, after reviewing the application, evaluate, in 
accordance with the standards of subsection 8.52.050(A), the 
impacts described in this subsection that the mining operation
may have on the Borough. The application shall contain a map on
a scale of 1:63,360, or a more detailed scale, a description of
the mine site and affected surface; description and timetable of 
the proposed mining operation, including all roads, buildings,
processing and related facilities; a description and timetable 
of proposed reclamation; a description of proposals for the 
sealing of open shafts, adits and tunnels upon the completion or 
temporary cessation of mining operations; a description of 
methods to be used to control, treat, transport and dispose of 
hazardous substances, sewage and solid waste; and a description 
of other potential environmental, health, safety and general 
welfare impacts, as well as neighboring property impacts and 
measures to be taken to mitigate their adverse effects. The 
application shall also contain additional information normally
prepared by the operator for its feasibility studies and mining 
plans, including information establishing the right to use the
affected surface, labor force characteristics and timing, 
payroll projections, anticipated duration of the mining 
operation, construction schedules, infrastructure description, 


and other information reasonably requested by the Borough. The
application shall additionally include a copy of each 
application submitted to other agencies and a report on the 
current status of all such applications, as well as amendments 
to those other applications as they are filed. To the extent 
that the information required by this subsection is provided in 
applications to other agencies, the operator may respond on its 
application form by cross reference to the relevant portions of
those applications. The requirement to provide information is 
continuing, and supplemental information regarding any changes 
in the information reasonably requested must be provided to the 
Borough throughout the duration of the application process.


(C) 
As part of the application process, and pursuant to 
section 8.52.050(A)(7), a socioeconomic impact assessment shall 
be conducted. 


(1) 
The Department, in consultation with the 
operator, shall determine the scope and budget of the 
socioeconomic impact assessment. The socioeconomic impact 
assessment shall, at the Boroughs discretion, be prepared by 
the Borough, by the operator, or by both. All costs and expenses 
of the assessment shall be borne by the operator, and the 
operator shall pay to the Borough, prior to the initiation of 
the assessment, any such costs and expenses to be incurred by 
the Borough. For the purposes of this section, the term 
"socioeconomic impact assessment" shall be and mean a report or
study that shall address the beneficial and adverse impacts, 
including direct impacts and indirect impacts, of the mining 
operation on existing and future local conditions, facilities 
and services, including transportation and traffic; sewer and 
water; solid waste; public safety and fire protection; 
education, native history and culture; health; recreation; 
housing; employment; local businesses; the rate, distribution 
and demographic characteristics of any population changes 
induced by the mining operation; and the fiscal impacts of the 
mining operation on public facilities and services, including 
general government functions. The socioeconomic impacts to be 
studied must be reasonably foreseeable and demonstrable. Highly
speculative impacts need not be studied. The purpose of this 
impact assessment shall be to provide information to the Borough
concerning possible beneficial and adverse mining operation 
impact on the Borough, in order to allow the Borough to 
determine the extent of these impacts and how these impacts can 
be mitigated. The impact assessment shall be completed before 
the time that the Department must make a recommendation on the 
application. Review of those portions of the application that 
would not be affected by information to be included in the 


assessment shall not be delayed while the impact assessment is 
being prepared for review.


(2) 
The Department may waive the requirement that any 
operator submit particular information required by this 
subsection, or that the impact assessment required by this 
subsection address certain impacts, if it determines that such 
information is not essential to evaluate what impact the mining 
operation will have on the Borough, that such information has 
been previously provided, or that such information is adequately
presented in another report previously submitted to the Borough 
or another agency. The waiver shall be in writing and shall set
forth the reasons for the waiver. 


(D) 
The Department shall conduct a preliminary review of
the application within 20 days of its submission and schedule
promptly thereafter a meeting with the operator to request such 
additional information as may be necessary to make the 
application complete. At this meeting, the Department and the 
operator shall establish the procedures for coordinating the 
review of the application with the review by other agencies of 
the applications submitted to them by the operator.


(E) 
The fee for processing the application shall be as 
specified in section 8.44.040. This fee is intended to cover the 
Borough's costs of review of the application. If, after receipt 
of the application, the Department determines that the cost of 
review is likely to substantially exceed such fee, the 
Department may, after consultation and discussion with the 
operator, recommend an additional fee to the Borough Assembly. 
Such additional fee shall be approved by the Assembly by motion 
and shall be set in an amount that will, as far as can be 
determined, cover the cost of review of the application, 
including reasonable administrative and overhead expenses. In 
recommending and approving the additional fee, the Borough may
consider, among other factors: that proper review will require
the Borough to retain outside professional assistance either to 
review the application or to perform original study and 
research; that significant staff effort will be required by the
Borough to adequately review the application; the involvement in
the review process of other governmental agencies, either 
through a federal environmental review process or other 
procedure; the necessity for extraordinary travel and 
transportation costs that may be incurred by the Borough during
review; the potential benefit of information generated by the 
application review to other mining operations or to the Borough;
and the necessity for extraordinary communication, duplication 
or publication costs arising from the review. 


(F) 
Unless the operator agrees to an extension, within 90 
days after the Borough has received all additional information
requested at the initial meeting described in subsection (D) of 
this section and the fee has been established and paid, the 
Department shall complete its review of the application, unless 
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required by the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). If an EIS is required,
then the timing of the review of the application shall be in 
accordance with the provisions of subsection (H) of this 
section. The application review shall include the following 
determinations: whether air and water quality will be maintained
in accordance with federal, state and borough laws, rules and 
regulations; whether sewage, solid waste, hazardous and toxic 
material will be properly contained and disposed of in 
accordance with federal, state and borough laws, rules and 
regulations; the extent to which the operator will agree to 
mitigate adverse impacts on the Borough; whether the mining 
operation will be conducted in such a way as to minimize safety 
hazards to the extent reasonably practicable and will mitigate 
adverse impacts on the public and on neighboring properties such
as those from traffic overloading, noise, dust, unsightly visual 
aspects, surface subsidence, avalanches, landslides and erosion;
and whether appropriate historic sites will be protected. The 
Department shall form a recommendation as to whether the permit
should be approved and, if so, it shall make a recommendation on 
the amount of the financial warranty as provided in section 



8.52.060. The Department's recommendation may include such 
conditions or stipulations as deemed to be reasonably necessary 
to mitigate any adverse environmental, health, safety or general
welfare impacts which may result from the proposed mining 
operation. The recommendation shall be provided to the operator
and forwarded to the Planning Commission where the matter shall 
be placed on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled meeting 
after notice has been published as provided in section 8.44.030. 
If the Commission determines that the application, with 
stipulations or conditions as appropriate, satisfies the 
standards of section 8.52.050, it shall approve the application 
and set the amount of the financial warranty.

(G) 
If the Department determines that the proposed mining
operation does not meet the standards of section 8.52.050, it 
shall so advise the operator, together with the reasons 
therefor. The operator may then either withdraw its application
or allow the recommendation to be forwarded to the Planning
Commission pursuant to subsection (F) of this section. If the
application is withdrawn, it may be revised and resubmitted 
within 180 days upon payment of an additional processing fee as 


determined by the Department to be reasonably necessary to 
defray the cost of reviewing the revised application to the 
extent that it is different from the original submittal. Revised 
applications shall be processed in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in subsections (D), (E), (F) and (H) of 
this section. 


(H) 
In order to prevent duplication of studies and to 
avoid premature decision-making, if an EIS is required to be 
completed on the mining operation pursuant to NEPA, then the 
application will not be considered to be complete until the 
draft environment impact statement (DEIS) is concluded. The 
Department will begin its review of the application upon its
filing. The operator shall advise the Borough immediately at any 
time during the application process or thereafter if NEPA is 
involved so that the Borough may participate in the NEPA 
process. The DEIS, the final environment impact statement and 
all comments and testimony related thereto will be considered as 
part of the application. The Department may, before the final 
environment impact statement is complete, prepare its 
recommendation as to whether the permit should be approved. If 
the recommendation is prepared before the final environment 
impact statement is complete, the recommendation shall not be 
presented to the Planning Commission until the final environment
impact statement has been published, and the Department has 
considered the final environment impact statement in its 
recommendation. The recommendation may include such conditions 
or stipulations as staff deems to be reasonably necessary to 
mitigate any adverse environmental, health, safety or general 
welfare impacts which may result from the proposed mining 
operation. The Department shall also recommend the amount of the 
financial warranty as provided in section 8.52.060. The 
recommendation shall be provided to the operator and forwarded
to the Planning Commission where the matter shall be placed on 
the agenda for the next regularly scheduled meeting and a notice 
has been published as provided in section 8.44.030. If the 
Commission determines that the application, with stipulations or 
conditions as appropriate, satisfies the standards of section 
8.52.050, it shall approve the application and set the amount of 
the financial warranty.


(I) 
After a permit has been approved by the Commission, a 
financial warranty in the amount set by the Commission has been
submitted in a form satisfactory to the Borough, and the 
operator has agreed to such conditions as are deemed appropriate 
by the Commission, the Department shall promptly issue a permit. 



8.52.050 Standards for issuance of permits; conduct of 
operations.

(A) 
In determining whether to recommend or issue a permit, 
the Borough shall require that:


(1) 
The mining operations be conducted in accordance
with this chapter and any other applicable provisions of the 
Borough Code in such a way as to mitigate adverse environmental, 
health, safety and general welfare impacts;


(2) 
Air and water quality be maintained in accordance 
with federal, state and borough laws, rules and regulations;


(3) 
Hazardous and toxic materials, sewage, and solid 
waste be properly contained and disposed of in accordance with
applicable federal, state and borough laws, rules and 
regulations;


(4) 
The mining operations be conducted so as to 
minimize to the extent reasonably practicable safety hazards and
to control and mitigate adverse impacts on the public and 
neighboring properties, such as from traffic overloading, noise, 
dust, unsightly visual aspects, surface subsidence, avalanches, 
landslides and erosion;


(5) 
Appropriate historic sites designated as 
significant by the Borough be protected;


(6) 
Reclamation of the affected surface be in 
accordance with the approved reclamation plan of the operator;
and 


(7) 
With respect to a large mine permit application, 
the operator negotiate and enter into a mitigation agreement 
with the Borough, which agreement shall establish responsibility
for the mitigation of reasonably foreseeable and demonstrable
adverse impacts, including direct impacts and indirect impacts. 
The operator shall be responsible for mitigating the direct 
impacts. The Borough shall be responsible for mitigating
indirect impacts except where the costs of mitigating specific 
indirect impacts are found by the Borough to:


(a) 
Exceed the amount of any Borough 
nonproprietary revenue increase attributable to the mining 
operation; and 


(b) 
Require a direct and significant increase 
in local taxes or fees to adequately mitigate the impact.
Highly speculative impacts shall not be included in the 
mitigation agreement. Taxes and nonproprietary revenues 
generated as a result of the proposed mining operation shall be 
a factor considered in negotiating the mitigation agreement.
This agreement shall be incorporated as part of the permit. This
subsection does not limit or otherwise affect the authority of 


the Borough to condition or place stipulations on a permit 
pursuant to this chapter.


(B) 
Reclamation of all affected surfaces shall be 
completed as soon as is reasonable after affected surface areas 
are no long being used in exploration and mining operations. 
Reclamation shall include the following:


(1) 
Cleanup and disposal of dangerous, hazardous or 
toxic materials;


(2) 
Regrading of steep slopes of unconsolidated 
material to create a stable slope;


(3) 
Backfilling underground shafts and tunnels to the 
extent appropriate;


(4) 
Adequate pillaring or other support to prevent 
subsidence or sloughing;


(5) 
Plugging or sealing of abandoned shafts, tunnels,
adits or other openings;


(6) 
Adequate steps to control or avoid soil erosion
or wind erosion;


(7) Control of water runoff; 


(8) 
Revegetation of tailings and affected surface 
areas with plant materials that are capable of self-regeneration 
without continued dependence of irrigation and equipment where 
appropriate;


(9) 
Rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife habitat; 
and 


(10) Any other conditions imposed by the commission. 


(C) 
Subsequent to the issuance of a permit or the 
authority to operate under an exploration notice, the operator's
compliance shall be measured against the requirements contained
in that permit or the conditions of the exploration notice, and 
the operator's plans submitted with the permit application or 
the notice. 


(D) 
In the event mining or exploration operations violate
or threaten to violate this chapter, a permit issued under this
chapter, the conditions of an exploration notice, or the 
operators plans, the operator shall notify the Borough of such 
fact and of the steps to be taken to return to compliance, or 
resolve the potential noncompliance. 


8.52.060 Financial warranty. 


(A) 
No permit shall be issued or exploration authorized 
pursuant to this chapter, until any financial warranty required
has been submitted by the operator, and accepted by the Borough.
The purpose of any financial warranty shall be to ensure that, 
during all phases of exploration or a mining operation, the 
operator will carry out all those obligations or requirements of 


the permit or conditions of an exploration notice, which are 
necessary to protect the environmental, health, safety, general
welfare and reclamation requirements of the Borough, or that, if
the operator does not carry out those obligations, there will be 
sufficient funds available to the Borough to enable it to 
complete the necessary work, taking into account the financial
warranties which the operator must submit to other agencies. The
Borough reserves the right to seek forfeiture of the financial 
warranty, in whole or in part, in the interest of protecting the
environmental, health, safety and general welfare requirements
of the Borough if it determines that the operator has violated
the obligations or requirements of the permit or the conditions 
of an exploration notice. The forfeiture shall be limited to the 
extent necessary to satisfy the requirements or conditions that
the operator has violated.


(B) 
The amount of financial warranty for an exploration 
notice shall be set by the Department. The amount of financial 
warranty for small mines and large mines shall be determined by 
the Planning Commission. In recommending and setting the amount 
of the financial warranty, the Borough shall take into 
consideration the amount and scope of any financial warranties
which have been submitted to other agencies. When the 
performance of such obligations is guaranteed by financial 
warranties that have been submitted to other agencies, the 
operator may be required to post a separate financial warranty
with the Borough if the Borough determines that the financial 
warranty submitted to another agency does not create a lien or 
interest sufficient to protect the interests of the Borough.
Examples of obligations to be covered by the financial warranty
required under this section include but are not limited to;


(1) 
Construction of berms, dikes, spillways, channels
or other facilities to control, detain, retain or reduce runoff, 
soil erosion and siltation, or to divert water around waste, 
tailings, stockpiles or other facilities or disturbed areas;


(2) 
Installation and maintenance of landscaping,
including berming, tree planting and other required grading or
planting to provide visual and sound barriers and to eliminate 
or reduce the appearance of scarring;


(3) 
Installation and maintenance of road or highway 
improvements to mitigate the impact of increased traffic or 
heavy trucking which is measurable and directly attributable to 
the mining operation; such facilities may include speed access
ramps or lanes, turn lanes, intersection improvements, traffic-
control devices or private haulage ways where necessary to avoid 
the use of public roads or highways. The cost of installation or
maintenance described in this subsection shall be shared by the 


operator and the Borough in relation to the proportion of the 
directly attributable and measurable impact on traffic of the 
operator's activities or the facilities being maintained, 
installed or improved;


(4) 
Reclamation of affected surfaces during and 
following exploration and mining operations;


(5) 
Regrading of steep slopes of unconsolidated 
materials to create a stable slope;


(6) 
Installation of facilities required to prevent or 
reduce degradation of air or water quality or to contain or 
control toxic or hazardous wastes;


(7) 
Removal of buildings, structures or equipment 
where appropriate; and


(8) 
Such other obligations as necessary to conform 
with the Borough's determinations under subsections 8.52.050(A) 
and (B).


(C) 
The financial warranty required under this chapter for 
a large or small mine permit or an exploration notice may be in 
any one or a combination of the following forms at the option of 
the operator; provided, that the cumulative amount is equal to 
the amount provided in subsection (B) of this section:


(1) 
Cash; 


(2) 
Certificate of deposit; 




(3) 
An irrevocable standby letter of credit from a 
United States bank; or


(4) 
A surety bond from a bonding company licensed to 
do business in the state which is satisfactory to the Borough 
for credit worthiness. 
Interest on cash deposits or certificates of deposit will accrue 
to the credit of the operator.


(D) 
In addition to the forms of financial warranty set 
forth in subsection (C) of this section, with respect to a small
mine permit or an exploration notice, the operator may elect to 
use a property bond as a form of financial warranty; provided, 
that at least ten percent of the total amount of the financial
warranty shall be cash or a certificate of deposit; and provided
further, that the Planning Commission or Department, as 
applicable, determines that the value of the property is 
equivalent to the amount required to be generated for 
satisfaction of the obligation and that the bond creates a lien
with sufficient priority to permit its collection should such 
become necessary.


(E) 
The form of financial warranty shall provide that the 
funds may be used by the Borough to satisfy the obligations 
described in subsections (A) and (B) of this section when there 
has been a determination by the Borough that the operator has 


not completed its obligations in a timely manner or has 
otherwise violated the terms of its permit or conditions of its 
exploration notice, and after notice and opportunity to perform 
the obligation has been given to the operator.


(F) 
The amount of the financial warranty shall be reviewed
annually by the Borough, and a determination shall be made 
whether the amount should be increased or decreased, taking into
account changes in the obligations of the operator to be 
undertaken during the ensuing year, cost of current obligations 
of final reclamation, and changes due to inflation of deflation.


(G) 
If the amount of financial warranty is to be increased 
or decreased by the determination made in subsection (F) of this
section, then the actual increase or decrease shall be made 
according to the procedure in subsection (B) of this section. 


8.52.070 Term of notices and permits; temporary cessation.


(A) 
Exploration notices and permits for mining operations 
shall remain in effect for the duration of the operation, as 
stated in the notice or in the application, subject to the 
conditions of this section; and provided, that the following 
conditions are met: 


(1) 
The financial warranty must remain in full force 
and effect;


(2) 
The operator must not be found to be in 
substantial violation of this chapter; and


(3) 
With respect to a large or small mine permit, 
mining operations must be continued in accordance with the plan 
contained in the application for at least 90 days in each year 
as to a large mine, and for at least 30 days in each year as to
a small mine. 


(B) 
During the term of any exploration notice or permit,
the Borough may, pursuant to subsection 8.52.060(F), revise the 
amount of the financial warranty. If the amount of financial 
warranty is increased, the operator shall submit the appropriate
amount of additional financial warranty within 60 days of the 
Borough's determination.


(C) 
The operator shall advise the Borough within ten days 
of the date upon which the operator receives notice that a 
financial warranty which has been submitted to any other agency
is reduced or released. 


(D) 
If at any time during the term of a permit, the 
operator determines that it will not conduct mining operations
for the applicable time minimums established in subparagraph
(A)(3) above, it shall notify the Department of that intent and 
request that its mining operation be placed in an inactive 
status. In conjunction with this notification, and as a 


condition to granting a request for inactive status, the 
operator shall advise the Department of the measures it will 
employ to prevent hazardous or dangerous conditions, erosion or 
other environmental damage which may result from the operator's 
activities, and the security measures it will employ at the 
mining operation during the inactive period. An operator may
continue in inactive status for a five-year period and may, with
the permission of the Department, obtain successive five-year
extensions of that status. At the conclusion of inactive status, 
the operator shall either resume operations or commence final 
reclamation in accordance with its plans. If an operator ceases 
operations for more than one year but does not request inactive
status, the Department may require the operator to commence 
final reclamation in accordance with its plans.


(E) 
Throughout the duration of a large mine permit, the 
operator of a large mine shall also notify the Department not 
less than 60 days prior to requesting placement on inactive 
status. The operator and the Borough shall maintain a process to 
exchange information regarding the impact on the Borough that
may result from a change in mining operations. In addition, the 
operator shall provide the Department with copies of any 
notification it may be required to provide to federal agencies
under federal law concerning proposed personnel layoffs at its
mining operation. The Department may waive any of these 
notification requirements in the event of an unforeseen act of 
God or disaster. 


8.52.080 Annual reports; monitoring; monitoring fee. 


(A) 
During the term of each exploration notice, the 
operator shall submit an annual progress report to the 
Department on or before March 31 of each year and shall describe 
the areas in which exploration was conducted during the 
preceding year, the amount of acreage which was disturbed by 
such exploration, and the nature and extent of associated 
reclamation activities. 


(B) 
During the term of each small mine permit or large 
mine permit, including any inactive period, the operator shall
submit an annual progress report to the Department on or before 
March 31 of each year, for the preceding year, describing the 
status of the mining operation in relation to the mining plan
and timetable in the application, and describing reclamation 
activities during the year.


(C) 
The Department shall have ongoing authority to monitor 
any mining operation for which a permit has been issued in order
to ascertain whether the mining operation is in compliance with
the requirements, terms, conditions and mitigation measures in 


the permit. The operator shall, upon reasonable notice, provide 
the Department with access, at reasonable times, to the premises
and to the records of the mining operation to the extent such
access to the premises and records is necessary to ascertain 
whether the mining operation is in compliance with the 
requirements, terms, conditions and mitigation measures in the 
permit.


(D) 
Throughout the duration of the term of a small mine
permit or a large mine permit, the operator shall pay to the 
Borough an annual monitoring fee to defray the costs of 
inspecting and reviewing the affected surface and compliance
with the permit. The annual monitoring fee shall be in such an
amount as may be established by the Planning Commission, from
time to time, as necessary to cover the reasonable costs of 
inspection and review. The fee shall be paid within thirty days
of the annual due date established by the Department. 



8.52.090 Technical revisions, summary approval, and 
amendments. 

(A) 
During the term of a permit, the operator shall notify 
the Department of all technical revisions to its operations. As 
used in this section a "technical revision" is a change in 
operations which does not, in the judgment of the Department,
have more than a minor effect on reclamation and which does not 
change the total amount of disturbance or the overall 
environmental or socioeconomic impact of the mining operation. 
After the operators notification is submitted to the Borough, 
the Department shall, within 30 days, determine and notify the 
operator whether the technical revisions may be accomplished
under the operator's existing permit, or whether the change is 
such that a permit amendment or summary approval of the change 
is required.


(B) 
If the operator or the Department determines that the 
change to the mining operations will require preparation of a
new or supplemental environmental impact statement, or will 
increase the acreage of affected surface or otherwise have a 
significant effect on reclamation or the environmental or 
socioeconomic impact of the mining operation, the permit shall
be amended pursuant to subsection (C) below, unless summary 
approval of the change is granted pursuant to subsections (D) 
and (E).


(C) 
The operator shall file with the Department an 
application for amendment to its original permit, except that no 
operator will be required to resubmit any information which 
duplicates applicable previous submittals. The permit amendment 
application shall be processed in accordance with the same 


procedure as established for processing permits under sections 
8.52.030, 8.52.040 and 8.52.050. The operator shall not commence 
changes requested in its amendment application until the permit 
amendment has been approved and, if appropriate, additional 
financial warranties submitted. 


(D) 
Upon request of the applicant, the Department may,
upon Planning Commission ratification, summarily approve a 
proposed change in mining operations not constituting a new land
use or separate development upon a written determination that:


(1) 
the mine is located entirely outside the Borough 
service area;


(2) 
the application is complete, providing all of the 
information necessary for the Department to make the summary 
approval determinations set forth in subsections (i)--(iv);


(3) 
the proposed change in mining operations will 
have no significant impact within the Borough service area on 
habitat, sound, screening, drainage, traffic, lighting, safety, 
dust, surface subsidence, avalanches, landslides, or erosion; 
and 


(4) 
the proposed change in mining operations has 
undergone or is undergoing environmental review and approval by 
one or more federal agencies, state agencies, or both.
The Department shall make the determination required by this
subsection within 45 days of submission by the operator of the 
completed application, unless additional information is 
required. If the Department requires additional information to 
make the determination, upon written notification to the 
operator the time for determination may be extended for up to 20
additional days after submittal by the operator of the 
additional information. If an environmental impact statement is
required by one or more federal agencies, completion of the 
draft environmental impact statement is necessary for summary 
approval.


(E) 
The Department shall promptly forward the proposed 
summary approval to the Planning Commission after the 
determination is completed. The Commission may ratify or reject 
the proposed summary approval. If the Commission rejects the 
proposed summary approval, it may:


(1) 
return the matter to the Department for further
consideration of whether the Department, in consultation with 
the operator, can address issues identified by the Commission 
through imposition of conditions or changes in the proposed 
mining operation; or


(2) 
direct that the proposed change be processed by
the Department as an amendment under subsection (C) above. 



8.52.100 Appeal. Any person who is aggrieved by a 
decision of the Department or the Planning Commission with 
respect to this chapter, may appeal that decision to the 
Commission or the Assembly, as applicable, as provided in 
chapter 8.08 and section 8.04.110. 

8.52.110 Release of warranties for mining operations.

(A) 
Upon completion of mining operations, the operator
shall file a written notice of completion with the Department 
when it believes it has completed any or all requirements of 
this chapter and its permit with respect to any or all of its 
affected surfaces. The Department shall, within 90 days after 
receiving the notice, or as soon thereafter as weather 
conditions permit, inspect the lands and reclamation described 
in the notice to determine whether the operator has complied 
with all applicable requirements.


(B) 
If the Department determines that the operator has 
successfully complied with all the requirements of this chapter 
and the permit, it shall release all financial warranties 
applicable to said requirements. Release shall be in writing and
shall be delivered to the operator promptly after the date of 
such filing.


(C) 
If the Department finds that the operator has not 
complied with the requirements of this chapter or the permit, it 
shall so advise the operator not more than 90 days after the 
date of the inspection. The operator shall be given a reasonable 
time to comply with requirements before a second inspection. If
the operator does not complete the requirements, or if after 
reinspection the Department is not satisfied that the operator 
has complied with all the requirements of this chapter or the 
permit, the financial warranty shall be subject to forfeiture to 
the extent necessary to satisfy any outstanding requirements. 



8.52.120 Successor operators. Any operator desiring to 
transfer its rights under an exploration notice, a small mine
permit, or a large mine permit shall submit to the Department a
request for transfer. This request shall identify the name and 
address of the new operator. The request shall be forwarded by 
the Department to the Planning Commission, along with the 
Departments recommendation. The Planning Commission may approve 
in writing the request for transfer if it finds that: the 
proposed operator will conduct the operations covered by the 
notice or permit in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and any additional requirements set by the Borough; the
proposed operator has submitted a financial warranty at least 
equivalent to the financial warranty of the original operator or 

such other amount as may be determined using the procedures in 
section 8.52.060; the proposed operator will continue to conduct
the operations involved in full compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the original notice or permit; and all obligations 
and responsibilities undertaken by the original operator shall 
be accepted and assumed by the proposed operator. The Commission
may deny approval of the request for transfer if the original
operator has any existing notice or permit violations at the 
time of the request until such time as the violations have been
remedied. If the Commission approves the transfer, the financial
warranty submitted by the original operator shall be released. 

8.52.130 Confidentiality. Upon the request of any
operator, information in any application or report relating to
the location, size, grade, geology or geochemistry of any ore 
deposit, proprietary process information, or information as to 
cost of mine construction or operation shall be kept
confidential by the Borough to the extent permitted by state or 
other applicable law. Information to be maintained as 
confidential must be separately presented to the Borough and 
must be marked "Confidential." 

8.52.140 Suspension or revocation of notices and permits.

(A) 
Subject to the procedures of this section, the 
Planning Commission may suspend or revoke a permit issued under
this article, or the authority to operate under an exploration 
notice pursuant to section 8.52.020, upon a determination by the 
Commission that: 


(1) 
The exploration or mining operations are not in
material and substantial compliance with the requirements of the
exploration notice or permit and such material and substantial
noncompliance remains unremedied after issuance of a compliance
order; or 


(2) 
The exploration or mining operations under the 
notice or permit have a history or pattern of intentional or 
grossly negligent noncompliance and compliance orders have 
previously been issued for such past events of noncompliance. 
Good faith efforts to remedy events of noncompliance shall 
create an inference that such noncompliance is not a cause for 
suspension or revocation.


(B) 
The Department shall provide the operator with written 
notification that it is recommending that the Planning 
Commission consider the entry of a suspension or revocation 
order under subsection (A) of this section. The written 
notification shall set forth the reasons for the Department's
recommendation and the operator's right to a hearing before the 


Commission. The operator shall have 15 days from the date of the
mailing of the notification to request such a hearing; the 
request by the operator must be in writing. If a hearing is
timely requested, it shall be held by the Commission within 30 
days of receipt by the Department of the operators request. At 
the hearing, the Department shall have the burden of 
establishing that the operator is not in material and 
substantial compliance with the permit or authority to operate
under an exploration notice, or that there is a past history or
pattern on noncompliance sufficient to justify suspension or 
revocation. 


(C) 
Upon written notification of the entry of a suspension
or revocation order to the operator or to any person operating 
under the authority of the permit or exploration notice, all 
exploration or mining operations shall cease except those 
specifically authorized by the Commission in the order or except
if the Assembly stays the order pending appeal.


(D) 
A suspended notice or permit may be reinstated by the 
Commission upon a determination that the exploration or mining
operations have been brought into compliance with the conditions
of the notice or permit. A notice or permit which has been 
revoked may not be reissued by the Commission until the 
Commission determines that the exploration or mining operation 
has been brought into compliance with the terms and conditions 
of the notice or permit, and the operator has clearly and 
convincingly demonstrated that preventative measures have been 
taken to ensure that those conditions which gave rise to the 
revocation will not reoccur. 


(E) 
A suspension or revocation order may be appealed to 
the Assembly in accordance with chapter 8.08. Pending appeal, 
the Assembly may in its discretion stay an order of suspension 
or revocation.

8.56.010 Addressing System. All areas within the City and
Borough of Yakutat shall use the municipal addressing and naming 
system established in this Chapter, including all public and 
private streets and all addressable structures and parcels. All 
free standing primary structures shall be assigned a street 
address. Accessory structures may also receive an address if 
needed. 

8.56.020 Official Addressing Map. A map entitled Official 
Street Address Map will be adopted by the Borough Assembly, 
after review and recommendation by the Planning & Zoning 
Commission, and thereafter administered and updated by the 
planning department. 

8.56.030 Street Addressing Standards. The Official Street 
Address Map shall be developed and based upon the following 
standards: 

A. Addresses shall be based on a common grid originating at a 
specified origin defined by the intersection of two 
baselines. 

B. The 	east-west baseline for north-south numbering shall 
begin at the westernmost point where Ocean Cape Road 
terminates at the Pacific Ocean thence continuing eastward 
to the intersection of Ocean Cape Road and Airport Road at 
which point Forest Highway 10 will become the east-west 
baseline until the Dangerous River. 

C. The 	north-south baseline for east-west numbering shall 
begin at a location on Ocean Cape Road defined by the 
intersection of Ocean Cape Road and the meridian at 
139°4430 West Longitude. The baseline shall continue due 

north, terminating at Monti Bay and due south terminating
in the Pacific Ocean.

not apply to:

1. 
The circumstance when a fire-box, furnace, 
boiler, locomotive or other fuel consuming device is being 
cleaned out and a new fire is being built therein, in which
event the smoke of a density greater than that described on the
Ringlemann Chart shall be permitted for a period of not to 
exceed six minutes in any single period of sixty minutes; or


2.

estimating the light obscuring smoke density.


2. 
The Ringlemann number is the number appearing on
the Ringlemann Chart ascribed by the observer to the density of 
smoke emission. 


3. 
The use of the chart will be made by placing it 
at such distance from the observer so that the squares appear as
even shades of coloring or when no white spaces between the 
lines are visible. Measurements shall be taken at the point of 
greatest density, which will usually be at the point of 
emission. Comparison of the smoke and observation with the 
various shades of the chart will then indicate the density of 
the smoke. Observation distances shall be not less than one 
hundred feet nor more than one quarter mile from the smoke 
observed. 


4. 
Where the density or opacity of the smoke as 
observed falls between two consecutive Ringlemann numbers, the 
lower Ringlemann number shall be considered the density of the 
smoke observed.

A. It is unlawful for any person to offer for sale, 
expose for sale, sell, use, explode or possess fireworks within 
the corporate limits of the Borough, except pursuant to a permit 
issued by the Borough.

may issue a permit authorizing the sale, possession, use, or 
exploding of fireworks by the permittee, subject to such 
limitations as to time and place, and subject to such further 
limitations and conditions as may be set out in the permit.

C. This section does not apply to highway or other 
warning flares or ammunitions for firearms, unless used for 
other than their intended purposes. 

D. "Fireworks" means any explosive or incendiary device, 
including but not limited to, firecrackers, Roman candles,
skyrockets, stench bombs, or other explosive or incendiary 
devices, used or intended for use for recreational or exhibition 

purposes.

15.12.030 Application --Processing. Permits shall be

and shall not be transferred or assigned except as provided 
herein. The director of public works shall examine each 
application to determine if it complies with the provisions of 
this Title and may inspect the premises which are desired to be
used in order to ascertain any facts which may aid in 
determining whether a permit shall be granted. If the director 
of public works finds that the application conforms to the 
requirements of this Title pertaining thereto, and also that the 
proposed use of such public place will not unduly interfere with
the rights of the public, he may approve the application. If 
the application is approved, the director of public works shall 
issue a permit, upon the applicant's compliance as herein 
specified with the provisions of this Title relative to bond and 
indemnity. The permit shall provide a time limit within which 
the work shall be completed, and work shall commence within

shall be void if the work is not commenced and completed within

15.12.040 Agreement by Permittee. Every permit issued by 
the Borough shall contain a statement, signed by the permittee, 
which shall provide substantially as follows:

A. The permittee shall be responsible for all claims and 
liabilities arising out of work performed, or arising out of the 
failure to perform his obligations with respect to street or 
other maintenance incidental to the permitted work. The 

permittee shall agree to forever indemnify, defend, save and 
hold harmless the Borough, its officers and employees, from and 
against any and all lawsuits, claims or actions brought by any 
person for or on account of damage to property, or injury, 
disease, illness or death of persons, including all costs and
expenses incident thereto, arising wholly or in part from or in 
connection with the existence of construction, alteration, use
or removal of the work to be performed. 

B. The permittee agrees that the permit is wholly of a 
temporary nature, that it vests no permanent right whatsoever,
that upon thirty days' notice, posted on the premises, or by
publication in a newspaper of the Borough, or without such 
notice, in case the permitted use shall become dangerous or such
structures shall become insecure or unsafe, or shall not be 
constructed, maintained or used in accordance with the 
provisions of the ordinances of the Borough, the permit may be 
revoked and the structure and obstructions ordered removed. 

C. If any structure or obstruction, or use or occupancy, 
is not discontinued on notice so to do by the director of public 
works, he may forthwith remove such structure or obstruction 
from such place, or make such repairs upon the structure or 
obstruction as may be necessary to render the same secure and 
safe, at the expense of the permittee, or his successor, and 
such expense may be collected from the permittee as provided by 
law. 

15.12.050 Bond or indemnity deposit on approved 
applications.  

A. If the director of public works determines that there 
is a possibility of injury, damage or expense to the Borough 
arising from an applicant's proposed use of any public place, 
the applicant shall furnish to the Borough a surety bond, cash
or certified check, payable to the Borough, to be in an amount
of not less than two hundred dollars. The deposit shall be in 
an amount determined by the director of public works at the time
of approving the application. The deposit shall be used to pay
the cost of the permit as specified in Section 15.12.090, and to
pay for any possible additional expense that the Borough may be 
called on to pay. Additional expense items may include 
additional inspectors, surveys or other services performed by 
the Borough above those included within the permit fee, the 
costs of restoring the street and removing any earth or other 
debris from the street, the replacement of any utility 
interrupted or damaged, the completion of any work left 
unfinished, and any other expense the Borough may sustain in
conjunction with the permitted work. In the case of a cash 

indemnity deposit, the balance, if any, after the foregoing 
deductions shall be returned to the applicant; if the deposit be 
insufficient, the applicant will be liable for the deficiency.

B. If a surety bond is filed, the bond shall assume all 
the requirements provided in Subsection (A) of this Section in 
relation to a cash indemnity deposit, shall run for the full 
period of the permit, and shall be conditioned that such 
applicant shall faithfully comply with all the terms of the 
permit and all the provisions of this Title and all other 
ordinances of the Borough. Such bond shall indemnify and save
the Borough free and harmless from any and all claims, actions 
or damages of every kind and description which may accrue to, or
be suffered by, any person by reason of the use of any public 
place, as provided for in said application. The bond shall be 
reviewed as to form by the Borough Attorney.

C. The Borough also reserves the right to determine the
circumstances and length of duration of a bond, cash or 
certified assurance required to cover possible damage and 
repairs which may result from the permittee's construction. If 
the application shall be to construct, reconstruct, repair,
maintain or remove any sidewalk, pavement, grading, underground
installations of any kind, or any other work which may affect 
the integrity of the street or other public place, the applicant 
shall file a surety bond, reviewed as to form by the Borough 
Attorney, which bond shall run for the full period of the permit
plus one year after the acceptance of the permitted work by the
director of public works. The amount of the bond shall be in an 
amount fixed by the director of public works and conditioned 
that the applicant shall faithfully complete all portions of the 
work according to the special plans and other data approved or 
specified by the director of public works. 

15.12.060 Bond or Indemnity Deposit for One or More 
Permits.  

A. Where it is probable that more than one permit will be 
desired, or that an applicant shall be periodically using public 
places, the applicant may of his own volition or the director of
public works may require the applicant to post a surety bond of
sufficient amount to cover the accumulated cost or risk involved 
at any certain time in a calendar year for a number of permits 
outstanding as determined by the director of public works, said
bond to be in force during the period of all outstanding 
permits, but in no case for less than one year. The bond shall 
be reviewed as to form by the Borough Attorney, conditioned to 
assume all of the requirements provided in Section 15.12.040 in 
relation to a cash indemnity deposit. 

B. However, if at any time any applicant applies for a 
permit to use a public place, and in the opinion of the director
of public works the work or risk involved in the application 
shall, together with other permits outstanding in the name of 
the applicant, exceed the amount of the then presently posted 
surety bond, the applicant may be required to post an additional 
or separate surety bond to cover the additional risk or work 
involved prior to the issuance of any new permits. The bond 
shall remain in force during the period of all outstanding 
permits, but in no case for less than one year.

C. In addition, the director of public works may require 
any permittee to post a surety bond in the calendar year
following the period of a permit when the extent of possible
damage to a public place has not been completely determined.

A. No deposit shall be required of any public utility of 
any city, the borough, public utility district, public
corporation or political subdivision which is authorized by law 
to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or 
over any public street, alley or right-of-way.

B. Permittees falling within this category will instead 
be required to furnish a certified statement assuring the 
Borough that any and all costs for repair of damage to the 
street or public place or installations within it will be at the
liability of the permittee when it has been determined by the 
director of public works that there is a reasonable basis to 
require such protection.

C. No bond, certified statement or permit fee will be
required of the various Borough departments or divisions nor of 
a Borough contractor where the contract documents specifically
require approved progress schedules and a complete coverage 
performance bond. 

D. This section, however, shall not relieve any person of 
the responsibility of obtaining the permit.

E. The director of public works shall have the sole 
authority to waive the requirements for bonding or certified 
assurance. 

15.12.080  Issuance of Permits. 

A. Upon approval by the director of public works of an 
application for the use or occupation of a public place, and 
upon posting of the bond, indemnity deposit or certified 
statement by the permittee, the director of public works shall 
issue a permit therefor. The director of public works may
attach to, and make a part of the permit, any special provisions 

and/or stipulations that he deems necessary to protect the 
public place or its appurtenances, other existing or approved

sequences of construction, materials and other pertinent items.

B. The original permit shall remain in the custody of the

will provide and maintain all necessary lighting devices 
(torches, lanterns, flashers and electric lights) throughout the
period when a street or other public place is used, and will be 
responsible for providing and maintaining any necessary warning
signs and barricades adjacent to the construction or work area. 
In the event that a Borough crew must be called to perform any 
maintenance on any lighting devices, or other means of 
protecting the public due to the failure of the contractor to 
comply with this regulation, a service call fee of fifty dollars 
per location will be billed to the responsible private firm or 
individual by the Borough. No payments on any contract with the
Borough will be made until all such fees are paid in full.

the building code of the Borough;

E. Soil investigations and reports may be required for 
all excavations so that appropriate pressures may be 
established. The director of public works may require 
investigations at any depth whenever specific conditions 
existing at the site of such excavation reveal an unstable soil
structure, or when circumstances indicate that the excavation 
may impair the lateral support of any public place, or whenever 

further investigation will supply information necessary to 
properly evaluate the application for the permit. 

15.20.030 Hazardous Conditions --Remedy. Whenever an 
excavation or fill within or outside a public place has caused 
or contributed to a condition that appears to substantially 
impair the lateral support of the adjoining street or public 
place, or endangers the public, an adjoining public place, 
street utilities, or Borough property, the director of public 
works may direct the contractor making such excavation or fill
and/or the owner of the property upon which such excavation or 
fill is being made, at his own expense, to take action to 
protect the public, adjacent public places, Borough property and
street utilities. 

B. In the event that the owner or contractor fails or 
refuses to promptly take the action directed or fails to fully 
comply with such directions given by the director of public 
works, or if emergency conditions exist requiring immediate 
action, the director of public works may enter upon the property
and take such action as he deems necessary to protect the 
public, or the adjacent streets or street utilities or to 
maintain the lateral support thereof, including placing of 
temporary shoring, backfilling, alteration of drainage patterns
and any other action reasonably necessary to decrease the 
possibility or extent of earth movement, or regarded as 
necessary safety precautions; and the owner and/or contractor 
shall be liable to the Borough for the costs thereof. 

15.20.040 Exposed Utility --Notice Required. Whenever 
any utility is to be exposed by an excavation, and the exact 
location and depth of the utility is unknown, the utility 
company shall be notified and excavation shall not be commenced 
until a representative of the utility company is present to aid 
in the location of the utility. It shall be the duty of the
utility company under this Section to have a representative at 
the location where the work is being done within twenty-four
hours of notice to the company by the contractor.  

15.20.050 Underground Facilities --Location Information ­-Damage.

A. Every effort will be made to appraise the permittee of 
underground facilities within the permitted area. Such 
information, however, is provided for convenience only, and the 
Borough will assume no responsibility for failure to provide 
complete data. The permittee shall take adequate and proper 
measures to inform himself as to the existence and location of 

any and all underground utilities apt to be encountered during 
his operation and shall protect the same against damage.

B. If any pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other 
apparatus are damaged, the permittee shall immediately notify
the director of public works and the utility company involved.  
The damage shall be repaired by the authorities having control 
of same at the permittee's expense.

shall be replaced with standard type pavement as indicated on 
the permit or as shown on the plans. Curbs, gutters, sidewalks, 
sewers, drains, structures, street signs and all other 
improvements damaged, disturbed or removed during the progress 
of the excavation work shall be restored or replaced in as good
condition as existed prior to commencement of work in accordance 
with the standard construction specifications of the Borough and
to the satisfaction of the director of public works.

otherwise agreed to by both parties. Saturdays, Sundays and 
Borough holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of this
time period. The hearing officer shall be someone other than 
the person who will direct the impounding and storage of the 
boat. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be 
whether the Borough has proven, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that there is or has been a breach of federal, state
or local law, regulation or ordinance rendering the boat subject 
to impoundment and sale or other disposal. The hearing officer 
shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be
bound by technical rules of evidence. At the conclusion of the 
hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision.
A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person 
requesting the hearing and the owner of the boat, if such owner
is not the person requesting the hearing. Failure of the owner 
or other interested person to request or attend a pre­impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to 
such hearing. 

D. A boat may be impounded by immobilizing it or removing 
it, or having it removed, and placing it in a public or 
commercial storage. Any boat impounded shall be held by the 
Borough for a period of not less than thirty (30) days during
which time the Borough shall post in three (3) public places 
within the Borough a notice describing the boat in general 
terms, the name and address of the owner, master or managing
agent, if known, the location of the boat, and the intention of
the Borough to sell the same at public auction on a day and at a
time and place certain for cash to the highest and best bidder.
The posting shall occur not less than ten days prior to the 
sale. The proceeds of such sale shall first be applied to the 
cost of impoundment and sale including storage costs under 
subsection F, and then to moorage and service fees accrued, and 
the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the Borough for 
the owner of the boat to claim; and if such balance is not 
claimed within two (2) years, it shall be deposited into the 
general fund of the Borough. Upon the sale being made, the 
Borough shall make and deliver its bill of sale, without 
warranties, conveying all of the Borough's interest in the boat 
to the buyer.

E. If, at the public sale, there are no acceptable 
bidders for the boat, the Borough may destroy, sell at private 
sale or otherwise dispose of the boat.

F. Any boat impounded by the Borough, and the owner, 
master or managing agent thereof, shall be subject to and liable 
for a storage charge of ten dollars ($10.00) per day or portion
thereof and shall be subject to and liable for all costs 
incurred by the Borough by reason of such impounding or removal.

G. At any time prior to the start of the auction provided
for herein, a person may redeem a boat from impound provided he
meets the following conditions:

1. 
He pays in cash all Borough charges against
the boat. 


2. 
He provides satisfactory evidence of right 
to possession of the boat and the Harbormaster 
has no actual knowledge that ownership or 
possession of the boat is in dispute.


3. 
The Harbormaster determines that possession 
of the boat would not be unlawful or present an 
immediate hazard to public health or safety or 
the general welfare. 



H. The hearing officer's decision provided for in 
subsection C in no way affects any criminal proceeding in 
connection with the impound in question and any criminal charges 

involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the 
appropriate court.

I. The remedy provided to the Borough herein is 
cumulative of all other remedies available to the Borough at 
law, in admiralty or otherwise. 

16.04.130  Use of Mooring Space and facilities.  

A. Every boat owner, operator or managing agent shall 
register the boat with the Harbormaster upon entry in or use of
the Borough boat harbor or moorage facilities, and pay the 
required fees. Registration shall be on forms provided by the
Borough, and shall be made immediately, but not later than 24 
hours after first use of facilities. If a boat is owned, 
captained or managed by an individual under the age of 18,
registration shall be made by both the owner, and the owners 
parent or legal guardian, who shall be jointly and severally 
liable for  any rental or other charges incurred. 

B. The Harbormaster may assign reserved moorage space. 
The renter of the reserved space receives only the privilege of 
occupying an assigned space on a preferential basis, and the 
exclusiveness or reserved status of the space may continue only 
so long as the renter owns a vessel and timely pays all fees
prescribed by this Chapter. The Harbormaster has the discretion 
of re-assigning spaces and moving vessels, if necessary for the 
safe and efficient operations of the facilities.

C. The Harbormaster may allow other craft to occupy an 
empty reserved moorage space at any time the assigned craft is 
absent from its assigned space for extended periods of time, 
without compensation or refund of prepaid moorage fees. Any
such vessel temporarily assigned by the Harbormaster to a 
reserved moorage space shall be required to pay the appropriate
transient moorage fee.

D. The Harbormaster shall determine the amount of space,
if any, to be allotted to reserved mooring. In the event that 
total space available for such moorage is insufficient to permit 
allocation of slips to all persons desiring them, the allocation 
shall be determined by date of application. At least thirty 

(30) 
days prior to the initial allocation of slips for reserved
moorage, the Harbormaster shall give public notice of the 
opportunity to apply for slips. Said public notice shall 
include public posting in at least three (3) conspicuous 
locations within the Borough, including the boat harbor.


E. 
Execution of a written agreement by the boat owner, 
operator or managing agent is required prior to usage of Borough 
moorage facilities, including moorage spaces, gridirons, boat 
trailers, and boat repair or storage facilities. 



16.04.140 Speed in Harbor. No boat shall operate at a 
speed such as to leave a wake, while entering, leaving or inside
the boat harbor. 

16.04.150 Mooring Rentals. Mooring rentals shall be paid 
to and collected by the Borough Finance Department at the 
borough offices as follows:

A. All rates, fees, and charges for the use of facilities 
and services of the Borough Boat Harbor and Borough moorage 
facilities shall be established by resolution of the Borough 
Assembly. This includes the rates and required terms of payment 
for transient moorage, on a daily, weekly, monthly, or other 
basis, for reserved moorage, and for use of the Borough boat
trailer, boat repair or storage facilities, and other available 
services. 

B. In addition to any other remedy provided for in this
Chapter or at law, all mooring and other fees and charges for
use of Borough moorage facilities shall constitute a lien 
against the boat, and its tackle, gear, equipment, appurtenances
and other similar property, under federal and state law.

C. For both small and large craft, no space assignment or 
other act of the Borough shall create or be deemed to create any 
property or ownership rights for the craft owner or possessor.  
Private loaning or subleasing of moorage space is prohibited.

D. Any fees delinquent for a period of thirty (30) days 
or more may cause cancellation of the moorage rights. The 
Borough may impound, remove, sell or otherwise dispose of a boat
for delinquent moorage fees, pursuant to the process set forth 
in Section 16.04.120 of this Chapter, or as otherwise provided
by federal or state law. If it appears to the Harbormaster that
the removal of a boat from the harbor without payment of 
delinquent moorage fees is imminent, the boat may be immediately
impounded without notice, and the hearing contemplated in 
section 16.04.120 may be requested post-impoundment. Any
removal of a boat by the Borough because of delinquent moorage 
fees shall be at the sole expense and risk of the owner. All 
moorage fees collected by the Borough shall be held in a special
fund or account and utilized exclusively for administration, 
operation and maintenance of moorage facilities. 

16.04.160  Violations.  

A. It shall be unlawful for any owner, operator, master, 
managing agent or other person in charge of the operation of a

LOCAL HIRE 

Sections: 

17.20.010  Local Hire. 

17.20.010  Local Hire.  

A. This Section applies to all construction 
contracts, to which the City and Borough of Yakutat and the 
Yakutat Borough Schools are a party, entered into after the 
effective date of this ordinance, in which the base price, 
or the price utilized in determining the low bidder, is 
$100,000 or more, unless exempted by or pursuant to this
Section. 

B. Each construction contract entered into by the 
City and Borough of Yakutat and the Yakutat Borough Schools 
to which this Section applies shall be deemed to contain 
the following provision: 

Contractor agrees, unless performance is waived 
pursuant to these provisions, to adhere to a 
fifty percent (50%) local hire policy in the 
employment of mechanics, laborers, and field 
surveyors, in accordance with the procedures set 
out below. 

Not less than fifty percent (50%) of the total 
hours performed by mechanics, laborers, and field 
surveyors employed by contractor in the 
performance of the work under this contract shall 
be performed by persons who are, at the time of 
performance of such hours, bona fide residents of 
the Yakutat Borough.

The fifty percent (50%) requirements shall 
apply separately with respect to each major 
classification designed in the current "Alaska 
Wage Rates" published by the Alaska Department of 
Labor (for example, "Tilesetters"). Compliance 
with the local hire requirement shall be 
determined on the basis of the total hours 
performed by each such major classification of 
mechanics, laborers, and field surveyors during 
each calendar month, and the percentage thereof 
performed by bona fide residents of the Yakutat
Borough. 

Contractor agrees to use his best efforts, by 
means including but not limited to, public and 
media announcements, advertisements, and 
inquiries to appropriate Borough officials, 
social and community organizations, to publicize 
the fact and nature of available jobs to bona 
fide residents of the Yakutat Borough.  

Qualified residents shall be given preference 

in hiring to the extent necessary to comply with 

the local hire requirements.

The Mayor of Yakutat may, with regards to 
Borough projects and the School Board may, with 
regards to school projects, upon presentation of 
such information as he may require, waive or 
relax any requirement of local hire imposed by 
this agreement upon Contractor, upon a written 
finding that strict adherence to the requirement 
waived or relaxed is impossible or otherwise not
in the public interest. Any such waiver or 
relaxation of the local hire requirement by the
Mayor or the School Board shall be subject to the 
Yakutat Borough Assembly's approval at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. If the Borough 
Assembly disapproves any such waiver or 
relaxation of the local hire requirement, then 
the Mayor's or the School Board's granting of 
such waiver or relaxation of the local hire 
requirement shall be disallowed. In no case 
shall any such waiver or relaxation of the local 
hire requirement be applied retroactively.  
Neither the Mayor, the City and Borough of 
Yakutat, the Yakutat Borough Schools, nor any
officer, agent, employee or official of the City 
and Borough of Yakutat or the Yakutat Borough
Schools be held liable for relaxation, waiver, or 
failure to enforce the local hire requirement. 

C. This Section shall not apply where prohibited by
State or Federal law, or the terms of any grant from the
State or Federal government, or any agency thereof.

D. The provisions of this Section may, with respect 
to any contract to which it would otherwise apply, be 
waived in writing by the Yakutat Borough Assembly prior to 
the release of bid proposals by the City and Borough of 
Yakutat and provided that such waiver be made known to all 
prospective bidders. In the event of such waiver, the 

contract shall not be deemed to contain the provision set 
out in Section B above. 

E. The provisions of this Section are for the sole
benefit of the City and Borough of Yakutat and the Yakutat 
Borough Schools, and confer no rights, at law or in equity, 
upon any other entity or person, including, but not limited 
to, the residents of the City and Borough of Yakutat.
