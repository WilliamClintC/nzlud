SAN RAMON, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
San Ramon, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 9 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The San Ramon, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1991, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Byron Athan, city attorney and manager. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This Supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 485, passed October 9, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

TITLE B - REGULATIONS 
DIVISION B1 - AMUSEMENTS 
Chapter I - Cardrooms 
Article 1 - General Provisions 

B1-1. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:

    "Cardroom" means any room, enclosure, or space furnished with a table or tables used, or intended to be used, as a card table for the playing of cards for currency, check, credit or other thing of value which is not prohibited and made unlawful by Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 319) or Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 330) of Title 9 of Part 1 of the Penal Code or by ordinance and similar games, the use of which table is available to the public, or any portion of the public. 
    "Cardroom employee" means any person, other than the licensee, directly connected with the operation of a cardroom as a supervisor, dealer of any game, or a participant in whose winnings or loss the licensee has a direct or indirect financial interest, but not a bartender, culinary worker, waiter, waitress or other person not directly participating in the cardroom operation. 
    "Cardroom license" means a license issued by the city to an applicant permitting the operation of a cardroom at a specific location and under specified conditions. A cardroom license shall only be issued to a person possessing a valid registration and current Gaming Registration Certificate from the Attorney General. 
    "Licensee" is a person or persons issued a license by the city to operate a cardroom. 
(Prior code § B1-2) 
B1-2. - Scope of provisions. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to regulate cardrooms and tables in the city of San Ramon concurrently with the state of California, to the extent authorized by, and as required by, the Gambling Control Act (Business and Professions Code § 19800 et seq.) and regulations of the state of California Department of Justice, Division of Gambling Control. 
    This chapter does not allow the licensing of any cardroom for the playing of any game prohibited by California statute, and any such play violates any license or permit issued hereunder. 
(Ord. 325 § 1, 1999: prior code § B1-3) 
B1-3. - No vested right. 
    A valid cardroom license or work permit creates no vested property or personal right for the licensee or permittee, and is entirely subject to this chapter and to ordinances affecting the license or permit from time to time, including new restrictions, conditions, fees and duration of license or permit validity. Any change required by the chapter to be noted on the license, permit or application, or noted in required supplementary information, constitutes a termination of the license or permit except for the purpose of paying fees. 
(Prior code § B1-6) 
B1-4. - Exemptions. 
    The city council may partly or wholly exempt any nonprofit society, club, fraternal, labor or other nonprofit organization that has members, bylaws and duly elected directors and that applies for exemption from compliance with this chapter, if the city council finds that the cardroom is for the exclusive use of the members and that no charge is made therefor. 
(Prior code § B1-7) 
B1-5. - Number of cardrooms limited. 
    The total number of licensed cardrooms permitted in the city shall not exceed the number of which the population of the city (as determined by the city council) is divisible by twenty thousand; but no valid license shall be invalidated by a decrease in that ratio. 
(Prior code § B1-8) 
B1-6. - Violation-Fire and safety provisions. 
    Violation of any fire and safety ordinance, rule or regulation of the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District or the Dougherty Regional Fire Authority, whichever district has jurisdiction, is a violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. 201 § 2, 1990: prior code § B1-4) 
B1-7. - Violation-Penalty. 
A.  No person shall, for himself or any other person, own, lease, operate, or maintain a cardroom unless he has a valid license therefor. 
B.  No person who has or should have a cardroom license shall allow any other person to commit acts contrary to subsection C of this section or Section B1-32D. 
C.  No person without a valid cardroom work permit shall act as a cardroom employee. 
(Prior code § B1-5) 
B1-8 through B1-10. - Reserved. 
Article 2 - Licensing 

B1-11. - Application. 
    Each application for a cardroom permit shall contain the following: 
A.  A copy of the current gaming registration certificate obtained from the state of California gambling control commission, or in lieu thereof, a declaration under penalty of perjury from the applicant that declaring that an application for such a certificate has been applied for and is being processed by the commission. 
    If applicant submits a declaration under penalty of perjury in lieu of the gaming registration certificate, referred to above, the cardroom license issued upon such application will become effective the date the gaming registration certificate is issued by the state of California gambling control commission; 
B.  Copy of the application for registration and supporting information filed with the Attorney General with the application for registration.

C.  The location of the business for which the permit is sought, including a specific description of the building or structure within which the cardroom is to be situated, and the specific portion of such building or structure for which a cardroom license is requested. If the entire building or structure is proposed to be used as a cardroom, the application shall so state and shall request a license for the entire building or structure. If only a portion of the building or structure is proposed to be used as a cardroom, the application shall so state, shall describe such portion and shall request a license for only such portion. No license pursuant to any permit shall be deemed issued for any portion of any building which the application fails to state is to be used for cardroom purposes or for which the application fails to specifically request a license; 
D.  The maximum number of card tables proposed to be maintained within the cardroom; 
E.  The specific types of card games proposed to be played within the cardroom; 
F.  A statement that the applicant understands and agrees that any business or activity conducted or operated under any license issued under such application shall be operated in full conformity with all the laws of the state and the laws and regulations of this city applicable thereto and that any violation of any such laws or regulations in such a place of business, or in connection therewith, shall render any permit and license therefor subject to immediate suspension or revocation; 
G.  A statement that the applicant understands and agrees that where a license is issued the chief of police or fire chief or their designated representatives shall have authority to inspect the premises and records of any licensee without a search warrant.

B.  At the time and place set for hearing of an application for a cardroom license, and/or at such other times and places to which it may be continuing the hearings, the city council shall consider the application and all written statements in support or in opposition, and shall give reasonable opportunity to be heard to all persons who wish to be heard either in favor of or in opposition to the granting of the requested license.

B1-13. - Issuance decision-Grounds for denial. 
    Upon or within a reasonable time after close of the hearing, the city council shall either grant or deny the requested license.

Each license granted by the city council shall be subject to the licensee's compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter as well as such conditions, limitations and restrictions as the city council may specifically prescribe. The city council may deny a cardroom license for any of the following reasons: 
A.  That the establishment or operation of a cardroom at the proposed place or places would: 
1.  Violate the city's zoning, fire, building or other ordinances or regulations, or other applicable laws or regulations; 
2.  Be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the city, 
3.  Adversely affect the orderly development of property within the city,

5.  Adversely affect the policy and goals as set by the general plan, 
6.  Create a nuisance and/or enforcement problem within the neighborhood or community, and 
7.  Encourage marginal development within the neighborhood; 
B.  That the location of the proposed cardroom is near a school or playground or other recreational facility frequented by minors; 
C.  That the design or location of the cardroom will hinder law enforcement officials in surveillance of cardroom activities or in the enforcement of this chapter or of state laws regulating gambling. 
(Prior code § B1-12) 
B1-14. - Attachment of conditions. 
    The city council may require that the license be conditioned, as necessary to effectuate this chapter, including conditions as to: 
A.  Location, design, lighting of cardroom and number of tables; 
B.  Hours of operation; 
C.  Parking location, design and conditions; and 
D.  Related business on the premises. 
(Prior code § B1-14) 
B1-15. - Duration-Fees. 
    Upon approval of the license by the city council and upon payment of a nonrefundable, nonproratable license fee in an amount per table set forth by resolution of the city council for each authorized table, regardless of whether the table is in constant use or not, the city clerk will issue applicant a cardroom license for the specific location. Licenses shall be valid for one year from the date of issue unless suspended or revoked prior to the expiration of one year. 
A.  In the event that a licensee wishes to remove tables from the premises, thus reducing the number of playing tables within the establishment, the city will not abate any of the previously paid table license fee. 
B.  In the event of surrender, suspension, revocation or termination, no permit investigation fee or license fee, or any portion thereof, shall be refunded. 
(Ord. 235 § 1, 1993: prior code § B1-15) 
B1-16. - Renewal. 
    The holder of an unsurrendered, unsuspended, unrevoked and valid permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may have a license issued under such permit renewed for respective periods of one year only upon the following terms and conditions: 
A.  An application for renewal of any such license in compliance with Section B1-11 of this chapter shall be filed with the city clerk thirty days prior to the expiration date of the license for which renewal is sought. 
B.  If such application for renewal is not filed within the time specified by subsection A of this section, such application will be considered to be a new application. 
C.  Renewal fees for licenses shall be in an amount set forth by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. 262 § 2, 1995; prior code § B1-16) 
B1-17. - Transferability. 
    Except as otherwise hereinafter provided, no cardroom license may be sold, transferred or assigned by the licensee, or by operation of law, to any other person or persons; any such sale, transfer or assignment, or attempted sale, transfer or assignment, shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of such license and such license shall thereafter be deemed terminated and void; provided and excepting, however, that if the licensee is a partnership and one or more of the partners should die, one or more of the surviving partners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or partners without effecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case the licensee shall thereafter be deemed to be the surviving partners. 
(Prior code § B1-17) 
B1-18. - Suspension or revocation-Grounds.

(Prior code § B1-18)

    The procedure for suspension or revocation of permits or licenses shall be as follows: 
A.  Suspension or revocation by the chief of police after a hearing of which at least three days' notice shall be given to the permittee or licensee of the time, place and purpose thereof. Such notice may take the format of an order to show cause, addressed to the permittee or licensee, requiring such permittee or licensee to show cause before the chief of police at a time, date and place stated why the permit or license held by such permittee should not be suspended or revoked and which order to show cause shall set forth the reasons or grounds upon or for which such suspension or revocation is proposed. Suspension or revocation of license by the chief of police shall be effective immediately. 
1.  Should the chief of police exercise authority granted him/her under authority of this section and suspend or revoke the permit and/or license of any cardroom licensed under the authority of this chapter, he or she shall immediately, in writing, notify the permittee or licensee as to what action he or she has taken. 
2.  During such suspension period that may exist or occur as a result of the chief of police's immediate suspension, as granted under this section, said permit and/or license will be temporarily null and void, and the playing of cards or any such use of the tables within such establishment shall be prohibited. 
3.  The suspension or revocation ordered by the chief of police may be stayed one time for a period not to exceed thirty days by written order signed by a member of the city council upon a showing that there is probable cause that the appeal from the suspension or revocation will be successful.

C.  Suspension or revocation by the city council after a public hearing of which at least ten days' notice shall be given to the permittee or licensee of the time, place and purpose thereof. Such notice may take the form of an order to show cause, addressed to the permittee or licensee, requiring such permittee or licensee to show cause before the city council at a time, date and place stated why the permit held by such permittee should not be suspended or revoked and which order to show cause shall set forth the reasons or grounds upon or for which suspension or revocation is proposed. 
D.  At any hearing the permittee may appear either in person or by counsel, or both in person and by counsel, and may produce and submit any relevant evidence such permittee may desire, oral or documentary. In the event of revocation, no new permit or license shall be issued to such permittee or licensee for a period of one year.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 436, §§ I, II, adopted Feb. 26, 2013, repealed the former Ch. IV, §§ B6-71-B6-80, and enacted a new Ch. IV as set out herein. The former Ch. IV pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for a complete history of former Ch. IV. 

B6-70. - Findings. 
A.  Tobacco related illness is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for about four hundred forty-three thousand deaths each year. 
B.  Scientific studies have concluded that tobacco use can cause chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and stomach, liver, uterine, cervix and kidney cancer. 
C.  According to the Center for Disease Control Report on Secondhand Smoke, there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes numerous health problems including severe asthma attacks, respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer. 
D.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, secondhand smoke is a known human carcinogen, responsible for at least three thousand four hundred lung cancer deaths each year among adult nonsmokers in the United States. 
E.  Each day in the United States, approximately three thousand eight hundred young people under eighteen years of age smoke their first cigarette, and an estimated one thousand youth in that age group become daily cigarette smokers. Tobacco advertising plays a significant role in encouraging use of tobacco products by minors. 
F.  Tobacco use is a major source of litter because cigarette butts can take up to fifteen years to decompose, leaking chemicals into the soil and posing harm to small children and pets if ingested. 
G.  According to the 2008 "Benefits of Smoke-Free Regulations in Outdoor Settings" study by the University of Sydney, to be completely free from exposure to secondhand smoke in outdoor places, a person must move approximately twenty-five feet away from the source of the smoke, about the width of a two lane road. 
H.  According to the County and Statewide Archive of Tobacco Statistics 2008 Report, eighty-seven and one-half percent of Contra Costa County residents are nonsmokers. 
I.  According to the Center for Tobacco Policy and Organizing, ninety-seven percent of California voters believe that secondhand smoke is harmful to those who inhale it. 
(Ord. No. 436, §§ I, II, 2-26-2013) 
B6-71. - Purpose. 
    The city of San Ramon has a compelling interest in enacting this chapter to restrict tobacco use in public places to protect those who live, work and play in San Ramon from the risks of secondhand smoke. 
    Numerous studies have found tobacco use to be an indoor and outdoor health hazard. The city of San Ramon desires to revise the existing ordinance of smoking regulations to address the hazards of secondhand smoke in outdoor settings. Restricting the use of tobacco in public places protects and enhances public health and welfare. Through this chapter, city recognizes the dangers of smoking and desires to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke by creating smoke-free environments for its citizens, while striking a reasonable balance between the needs of persons who smoke and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air.

B6-131. - Public nuisances. 
    The owner of any property within the city has a primary responsibility to keep the property free of any public nuisance. 
    Pursuant to Government Code Section 38771, the city council declares that it is a public nuisance for any person owning, leasing, occupying or having charge of any property to maintain, permit or allow such property to remain in a defective or unsightly manner, or in such a state of deterioration, disrepair or neglect that it causes or may cause at least one of the following conditions: a health, safety or fire hazard; diminution of surrounding property values; blight upon the aesthetic quality or appearance of the neighborhood; or an attractive nuisance to children. 
    It shall be a public nuisance if any of the following activities, uses of property or conditions exist on a property within the city: 
A.  Storage of boxes, litter, garbage, broken or discarded furniture, equipment, appliances, machinery, vehicle parts, or other refuse for periods in excess of seventy-two hours. 
B.  Accumulation of debris, litter, dirt, overgrown vegetation, dead trees or plant materials or weeds.

P.  A building which is partially destroyed for a period of ninety days or more, or left in a state of partial construction unless pursuant to a valid building permit. 
Q.

Nothing in this article shall prevent public officials from taking any and all actions in emergency situations they deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
1.  The city manager shall post a notice on or near the dangerous condition. If the city manager determines that the circumstance and time reasonably permits, the city manager shall also attempt to directly notify the property owner and any other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in the property by telephone, telegraph, hand delivery, facsimile or other reasonable means. Failure to give such additional notice shall not affect the adequacy of the posted notice or otherwise constitute a defect in the process authorized by this article. The notice shall contain: 
a.  A statement that the property was found to be imminently dangerous with a brief and concise description of the conditions found to render the property imminently dangerous. 
b.  A description of what actions are required to be taken by those persons receiving the notice and the time within which action must be commenced and completed. 
c.  A statement that the city manager may cause the abatement work to be done and charge the cost thereof against the property or its owner. 
2.  If the attempt to contact the person is unsuccessful or if the responsible party fails or refuses to take immediate and effective action to eliminate the threat after being requested to do so within the time set forth in the notice, the city manager may proceed to take abatement action to the extent necessary to remedy the immediate danger without further notice or right to a hearing. 
3.  Once the abatement action has been completed, the property owner may appeal the need for abatement action and/or abatement cost pursuant to the following procedure: 
a.  A request for appeal must be received by the city clerk within ten days after service, by first class mail postage prepaid, of the statement of abatement cost. Service shall become effective on the date of the first class mailing. 
b.  After a completed request for hearing form has been filed with the city clerk, the city clerk shall set the date, time and place for the hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days after the city clerk receives the request. 
c.  The person requesting the hearing shall be notified by first class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, of the time and place set for the hearing. The notice shall be sent to the address on the request for hearing form by the person requesting the hearing. Service shall become effective on the date of the first class mailing. Failure of the person requesting the hearing to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any of the proceedings taken. 
d.  The person requesting the hearing or the city may request one continuance, but in no event may the hearing be continued more than thirty days after the date of the originally scheduled hearing unless the hearing officer finds that the circumstances warrant a longer continuance not to exceed sixty days after the date of the originally scheduled hearing. 
e.  The failure of any person to file a request for hearing in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing and shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. 
f.  The administrative hearing is informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. 
g.  The city and the person contesting the summary abatement action and/or summary abatement cost shall be given an opportunity to testify and present evidence. The person may represent themselves or be represented by any person of their choice at their own cost. 
h.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional information from the city and/or the person contesting the summary abatement action and/or cost. 
i.  The failure of the person contesting the summary abatement action and/or cost to appear at the hearing shall be deemed to be a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing and shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. 
j.  The decision of the hearing officer shall be in writing within fifteen business days of the conclusion of the hearing stating the reason for the decision. A copy of the hearing officer's written decision shall be sent by first class mail to the address provided on the request for hearing form. The hearing officer's decision shall be final.

In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the council shall be required where ownership or control of more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively.

Grantor may require grantee to submit such additional information as the grantor may reasonably require to determine that the proposed transferee possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications, or that grantee is in compliance with all substantive franchise requirements. An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. If the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the applicant are determined by the grantor to be satisfactory, and if grantor determines that grantee is in compliance with all substantive franchise requirements, the grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise. If the grantor has not taken action on the grantee's request for transfer within one hundred twenty days after receiving FCC Form 394 or equivalent, grantor's consent to such transfer shall be deemed given.

B9-15.1. - Abandonment or removal. 
A.  If the grantee discontinues the use of any of its property within the public rights-of-way for a continuous period of twelve months, such property shall be deemed to have been abandoned by grantee. Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part thereof, shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use. 
B.  Grantor, upon such reasonable terms as grantor may lawfully impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore to grantor's reasonable satisfaction any affected public right-of-way. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing immediately prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments.

B9-15.2. - Restoration by grantor: Reimbursement of costs.

At the option of the grantor and subject to applicable law, a franchise granted hereunder may be revoked one hundred twenty days after appointment of a receiver(s) or trustee(s) to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless: 
1.  The receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated within said one hundred twenty days; or 
2.  Such receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor; or 
3.  Such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty days, have executed an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise. 
B.  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the cable system, in whole or in part, the grantor may serve notice of revocation upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall be revoked thirty days after service of such notice, unless:

B9-16.2. - Waiver. 
A.  The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or on the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one (1) instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
B.  The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement by any failure of the grantor on any one or more occasions to require or seek compliance with any such terms or conditions. 
(Ord. 335 § 2, 2001) 
B9-16.3. - Rights of individuals.

D.  In the conduct of providing its cable services or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability, if such equipment or capability exists, for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen. 
E.  No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment owned by grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber's premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon subscriber's property shall be deemed granted. 
F.  The grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not sell, or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber pursuant to state and federal privacy laws: 
1.  Any list of the names and addresses of subscribers containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; and 
2.  Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party.

Article 17 - Severability 

B9-17. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had previously been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee thirty days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision.

 (a)  Inspection and notice to repair, notice to vacate. 
 1. The Building Official shall inspect or cause to be inspected every building or structure or portion thereof reported dangerous, damaged or substandard. If such is found to be an unsafe building, the Building Official shall obtain a preliminary title report as to the building or structure or land on which it is located, which shall identify all owners of record, lessee of record, holders of mortgages, deeds of trust or other liens and encumbrances of record. The Building Official shall serve upon each such person by personal service or by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, a written notice stating the defects of the building or structure and requiring the owner to commence either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of notice or within such time as deemed reasonable by the Building Official.

 The notice shall also inform recipients of their rights and the procedures for filing an appeal of the action to City Council within ten (10) days of the date of the notice and that their failure to appeal will constitute a waiver of their right to an administrative hearing and adjudication of the notice and order any portion thereof. 
 The notice shall be sent to each such person at his address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll of the county or as known to the Building Official. If no address of any such person so appears or is known to the Building Official, then a copy of the notice shall be so mailed, addressed to such person, at the address of the building or structure found by the Building Official to be unsafe. Service by certified mail shall be effective on the date of mailing. The Building Official shall cause at least one copy of the notice, bearing title letters at least one inch high reading "NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE," to be posted conspicuously on the building, structure, or portion thereof alleged to be unsafe. 
 2. If the building or structure is occupied, and the Building Official finds that protection of human safety necessitates that it be vacated, the notice shall also require that the building, structure, or portion thereof be vacated not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the notice or within such time as deemed reasonable by the Building Official. 
 The Building Official shall serve by first class mail, postage prepaid, a notice to the occupant of each dwelling unit or unit under separate use in the building or structure found to be unsafe, stating that the Building Official has, as a result of an inspection, found the building or structure to be unsafe and unfit for human occupancy, and advising the occupant that he must vacate the building or structure within the specified time, and that further occupancy of the building or structure beyond the date required for vacancy is unlawful and constitutes a misdemeanor. 
 The Building Official shall cause to be posted at or upon each exit of the building or structure a notice in substantially the following form: 
NOTICE TO VACATE; b; 
 The Building Official of the City of San Ramon has found this building to be unsafe and unfit for continued human occupancy. This building or structure must be vacated not later than _______ .

In the event the nuisance is not abated by the owner within the time prescribed, the Building Official is authorized to raze, demolish, remove, rehabilitate, or repair the building or pertinent portion thereof, or have the work done under his direction or supervision, or pursuant to purchase order or contract. The Building Official shall keep an itemized account of the expenses involved in the razing, demolishing, removing, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or repair of any building. The Building Official shall submit this itemized statement to the City Clerk who shall mail a copy of the statement to the person owning the land and to any holder of any interest of record along with a notice of the time and place when and where the statement shall be submitted to the City Council for approval and confirmation, at which time the City Council shall consider any objections or protests, if any, which may be raised by any property owner liable to be assessed for the cost of such work and any other interested persons. 
 (e)  Hearing by City Council - Statement of expense. At the time fixed for the hearing of the statement of expense the City Council shall consider the statement together with any objections or protests which may be raised by any of the property owners liable to be assessed for the doing of the work and any other interested person, after which by resolution the report as submitted, or as ordered, revised, corrected or modified by the City Council, shall be confirmed and adopted. If said statement is not paid within five (5) days after the adoption of the resolution, it shall constitute a lien of the real property upon which the building or structure was removed, and shall be collected as a special assessment against the real property. The resolution shall further direct that the City Clerk shall file with the auditor of Contra Costa County and the County Assessor and Tax Collector, certified copies of the resolution and the statement adopted therein. The clerk shall direct the auditor to enter the amounts of the charges against the real property described in the statement and resolution as it appears on the current assessment roll. The amount of the charge shall constitute a lien against the real property against which the charges have been imposed. The tax collector shall include the amount of the charges on bills for taxes levied against the real property. Thereafter, the amount of the charge shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner and by the same persons, as, together with and not separately from, the general taxes for the City of San Ramon and shall be subject to the same penalties and interest upon delinquent payment. 
 (f)  Power of Building Official to secure hazardous structures. In addition to the procedures provided for abatement of nuisances caused by dangerous and hazardous structures as set forth in this Code, the Building Official is hereby given summary power to secure from entry any structure which in his discretion he determines to be immediately dangerous, or immediately hazardous, or in any other manner injurious to public health or safety. Such structures may be secured by the Building Official by nailing boards over the doors and windows of such structures; however, he shall not be limited to only this method and may use other methods at his discretion to accomplish the same purpose which may be more appropriate under the circumstances. The Building Official shall also post a sign stating in effect, "DANGER, DO NOT ENTER," upon the structure in at least one conspicuous place, with the wording "DANGER" in letters at least one inch in height. The Building Official shall immediately upon such action send notice to the owners of the real property upon which the structure is located, as shown on the last equalized assessment rolls. Such notice shall contain the following information: 
 1. that he has secured the structure; 
 2. the cost incurred by the City thereby; 
 3. that he has posted signs as provided by this section; 
 4. the reasons why he has taken the action; 
 5. that an appeal may be made within ten (10) days to the City Council, as provided by Sections C-13 and C-14 of the Municipal Code; 
 6. that if his action is not annulled by the City Council, the cost of securing the property shall become a lien upon the real property unless the cost is paid to the City within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice. After hearing all evidence and other relevant matters presented at said hearing, or without hearing, if no appeal is made upon the report of the Building Official, the City Council may then confirm, amend, or annul the action of the Building Official. If the action of the Building Official is annulled, the City, at its own expense shall remove any and all signs stating that the building is unsafe to enter. If, however, the City Council confirms the action of the Building Official in securing the structure, at the hearing of appeal, or if no appeal is taken at any other regular meeting or adjourned meetings, then the cost incurred by the City in securing the structure shall become a lien against the property and a resolution of the Council confirming the action of the Building Official, including the imposition of a lien upon the property upon which the structure is located, to pay for the cost of securing it, may be adopted upon receipt of a report from the Building Official. Such resolution may be filed with the Assessor of Contra Costa County, and the lien imposed thereby may be collected for the City by him, along with the next annual tax levy and assessment on said property. 
 (g)  Power of Building Official to abate immediately dangerous or hazardous nuisances. The same procedure as provided for in Subsection (f) for abating nuisances through securing from entry any structure which is determined by the Building Official to be immediately dangerous or immediately hazardous may also be used by the Building Official in connection with the summary abatement of all other public nuisances upon private property which the Building Official determines, at his discretion, to constitute an immediate dangerous or hazardous condition. The Building Official may then summarily abate such nuisance at his discretion in the most appropriate manner, under the circumstances, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the following methods: fencing, draining water from swimming pools, and filling with appropriate ballast, removing fire hazards, filling or covering open holes and grading or strengthening land fills or excavations. Although the manner and method used by the Building Official shall be at his discretion, he shall, in making his determinations, seek the most economical method and endeavor not to place an undue economical hardship upon the owner of the property, and only use those measures which will eliminate the dangerous and hazardous features. Notice of the action shall be sent to the record owner of the property affected as shown on the last equalized assessment rolls, and procedures for appeals, hearing establishing liens, collecting of the lien by the assessor, and other actions by the City Council shall be the same as that provided in this section. 
 (h)  Discontinuation of utility services. In the event the Building Official shall cause abatement of any condition therein provided as an additional method to insure that payment is made to the City for the costs of such abatement in cases involving abandoned structures, the Building Official is authorized to order all utility companies to discontinue any utility services or connection to the property upon which the structure is located and shall not revoke such order; and the utilities shall not be reconnected until full payment of such cost is paid to the City as determined by the Building Official. 
 (i)  Administrative costs. Any administrative costs incurred by the City not paid for by the owner of the property (if such costs have been incurred in connection with the repair or removal of an unsafe building or other structure) may be charged as a lien to the land upon which the structure is located. The Building Official shall, in such case, notify said owner in writing of all the administrative costs incurred up to the date of such notice, and include a statement in such notice that if any objection is to be made to these costs, an appeal must be made to the Council in accordance with appeal provision specified in Sections C-13 and C-14 of the San Ramon Municipal Code. The Council may confirm or modify the imposition of such administrative costs after hearing the evidence by the applicant and the Building Official. 
 Administrative costs, as used in this section, shall include the cost of the preliminary title report used to determine the true owners and those who have any interest in the property, and other such items of expense necessarily required to prepare the matter for hearing, whether or not such hearing is actually held. If no hearing is held because the building is demolished or repaired, or no hearing is held because the owners and persons financially interested in the property do not appeal to the City Council for a hearing, the City Council may adopt a resolution imposing such administrative costs as a lien upon the land and may order such costs collected by the County Tax Collector with the next year's regular real estate taxes upon the property upon which the nuisance existed. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the record owner of the property, as well as all other persons having any economic interest in the property as disclosed by the title report. 
 (j)  Contracts, purchase orders, and bonds. Whenever this Code provides that the Building Official is authorized to cause a building, structure, or portion thereof which has been declared to be a public nuisance to be demolished, removed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or repaired, or to abate any nuisance by appropriate action involving the construction, grading, filling, removal or demolition of any object, such Building Official is authorized to issue purchase orders or to enter into contracts on behalf of the City with private contractors in accordance with the procedures set forth in such ordinance or ordinances of the City governing the solicitation of bids for purchases and contracts, and such rules and regulations as have been or may be promulgated thereunder. Such contracts, if for amounts exceeding $500.00, shall require that the contractor furnish bonds by one or more corporate sureties authorized to transact business in California: 
 1. In the amount of the contract, conditioned upon the faithful performance thereof; 
 2. In an amount equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the contract, securing payment to any and all subcontractors, and persons furnishing labor, materials, or equipment to the contractor or subcontractors. Such contracts shall be either for work regularly budgeted or for work for which the cost may be recovered by imposing a lien upon the land, and collected with real property taxes or assessments. 
 (k)  Permit Fees. If any owner or person in possession of real property applies for a permit to either demolish or rehabilitate any building or structure or portion thereof, after proceedings have been commenced to determine whether such building, structure, or portion thereof should be declared to be a public nuisance, the fee for such permit shall be increased over and above the amount otherwise due by an additional amount determined by the Building Official to cover all administrative costs incurred by the City on such proceedings up to that point. If the applicant for such permit is aggrieved by such determination, he may file an appeal to the City Council by filing a Notice of Appeal with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of such determination. For purposes of this subsection, proceedings shall have been deemed to have been commenced when the Building Official shall have served written notice pursuant to Subsection (c) stating the defects of the building or structure and requiring the owner to commence repairs, improvements, demolition, or removal.

A.  If the division determines that a traffic study (the study) is necessary, the division shall hire a consultant to perform the study. The division may require the project applicant to supply whatever information may be necessary for the preparation of the study. The division is responsible for the adequacy and objectivity of the study. The project applicant shall be responsible for the entire cost of the preparation of the study, including consultant fees and city expenses. The division may require the project applicant to post a bond, pay for estimated municipal and consultant costs prior to the preparation of the study, or use other mechanisms to guarantee payment for costs incurred or to be incurred. 
B.  The traffic study must include the following: 
1.  Project Trip Generation and Peak Hour Volumes. 
a.  A summary table shall be provided that lists each type of land use, the measurable unit of the project used to determine traffic impacts, e.g., square footage, occupancy, employees, acreage, etc., the appropriate trip generation rate (total daily traffic and peak hours of the adjacent streets), and resulting total daily and peak hour trips generated by the project. 
b.  The official source for trip generation will be the latest version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual. Consideration will be given to the use of other published reports and papers if properly referenced and included with supporting documentation. (Caltrans and/or San Diego Association of Governments trip generation rates may be substituted by reference only). Additional consideration will be given to original research work of similar or like conditions with suitable documentation. 
c.  Trip reductions will be considered for pass-by traffic, TSM/TDM measures, and for internal traffic in large subdivisions. The estimates for trip reduction shall be well documented arguments presented for consideration by the transportation services division to assure the long-term validity of any proposed reductions prior to their use in the traffic analysis. 
B.  Project Trip Distribution. The transportation services division shall set the boundaries for traffic distribution and extent of intersection analysis. The consultant shall determine the project trip distribution based on the traffic network expected to exist upon completion of the project and reflect population and employment distribution for existing and future conditions as provided by census tract data and/or ABAG projections; survey information of existing or similar uses may be used as determined appropriate by the transportation services division. Distribution of trips to and from a proposed site should consider variations based upon trip type (work, school, home, etc.), travel time on congested routes and dissipation of traffic along travel corridors. 
C.  Existing and Projected Traffic. The study shall provide graphics which show p.m. peak hour traffic volume turning movements at project driveways and designated study intersections within the study area. The study must include the following: 
1.  Peak period project traffic (in and out) for all turn movements at study intersections for critical peak periods; 
2.  Peak period traffic volume graphics are to include all through and turning movement volumes for: 
a.  Current conditions,

2.  Level-of-service (LOS) analysis shall be prepared reflecting p.m. peak hour traffic conditions at all designated study intersections for the following analysis scenarios: 
a.  Existing traffic volumes without project traffic, assuming existing transportation facilities and capacities; 
b.  Existing traffic volumes plus project traffic, assuming existing transportation facilities and capacities; 
c.  Existing traffic volumes, plus traffic from approved, but as yet unbuilt or unoccupied, projects without traffic from the subject project, assuming transportation facility improvements programmed in the city's five-year Capital Improvement Program, State Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP) or adopted capital improvement plans of other jurisdictions; 
d.  Existing traffic volumes, plus traffic from approved, but as yet unbuilt or unoccupied, projects plus traffic from the subject project, assuming transportation facility improvements programmed in the city's five-year Capital Improvement Program, State Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP) or adopted capital improvement plans of other jurisdictions; 
e.  Existing traffic volumes, plus traffic from approved, but as yet unbuilt or unoccupied, projects plus traffic from the subject project, assuming transportation facility improvements programmed in the city's five-year Capital Improvement Program, State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) or adopted capital improvement plans of other jurisdictions, plus project-related traffic impact mitigation measures; 
f.  Cumulative development traffic volumes, without traffic from the subject project, assuming completion of the San Ramon General Plan Circulation Network (Figure 4) and other long-term regional transportation improvements; 
g.  Cumulative development traffic volumes, plus traffic from the subject project, assuming completion of the San Ramon General Plan Circulation Network (Figure 4) and other long-term regional transportation improvements plus project-related traffic impact mitigation measures. 
3.  The results of the preceding LOS analyses shall be presented in a tabular format which includes the estimated V/C ratio and corresponding level-of-service for each analysis scenario at all designated study intersections. 
    The department may require estimates of delay per vehicle and queue lengths for four-way stop intersections, signal warrant analyses, and may require analysis using the Unsignalized Intersection methodology contained in the Highway Capacity Manual. 
E.  Levels of Traffic Service. 
1.  The minimum acceptable level-of-service at arterial intersections shall be the upper bound of LOS D, i.e., V/C ratio not greater than 0.90. 
2.  Exceptions to Level of Service Requirements. The requirements of this section do not replace or relieve a project from providing for mitigations to the extent they are possible. The city council shall not grant an exception under this subsection on appeal or review until it has first made the findings required by these guidelines. Locations identified for exceptions to the maximum allowable levels of traffic service shall be reviewed on an annual basis in conjunction with development of the city capital improvement program. Recommendation for inclusion on the exception status list shall be based upon written findings setting forth reasons therefor, including: 
a.  Proximity to freeway access, or involves an intersection of freeway access requiring multijurisdictional funding and/or major cost improvement of freeway widening and overpass reconstruction; 
b.  Intersections having a majority of through traffic on the major street (majority defined as greater than fifty percent of traffic with origins and destinations external to San Ramon). 
F.  Traffic Signal Analysis. The study shall determine the need for new traffic signals determined in accordance with the most current edition of the Caltrans Traffic Manual. Traffic progression and pedestrian movements must be considered in the evaluation of traffic signal needs. 
G.  Traffic Accidents. Special studies of traffic accidents may be required on critical corridors related to the project as required by the division. The study period would normally be two years with base data provided by the city. Changes in accident potential should be related to changes in traffic attributed to the project and safety mitigation measures should be included where necessary. 
H.  Mitigation Requirements. If the study identifies significant traffic impacts to any critical intersection within the study area, mitigation measures shall be identified which reduce project impacts below the threshold of significance (less than 0.02 increase in estimated V/C ratio) and which result in acceptable level-of-service at all study intersections (V/C MDUL< 0.90). Mitigation which may be assumed for the purpose of estimating future traffic conditions may include roadway improvements programmed by the city, adjacent municipalities, Contra Costa County and/or Caltrans for which funds have been appropriated or obligated. The mitigation section shall include the following: 
1.  Proposed Transportation Improvements for Project Mitigation. The location, nature and extent of proposed improvements to the transportation system must be determined and described to assure sufficient roadway capacity. Identify all mitigation measures required by the project. All intersection and roadway improvements required to mitigate significant project impacts or unsatisfactory levels of traffic service must be listed and identified in the following categories: 
a.  Significant project impacts or unsatisfactory level of traffic service for which feasible mitigation is available. Mitigation measures shall be identified. 
b.  Significant project impacts or unsatisfactory level of traffic service for which feasible mitigation is included in or would require inclusion of improvements in the city's five-year capital improvement program from the date of project approval. Consideration of mitigations under this condition shall require: 
i.  Development of conceptual plans in sufficient detail to permit preparation of cost and funding estimates, and cost and funding estimates shall be prepared. 
ii.  Identification of funding mechanisms to insure implementation of the capital improvement project. 
iii.  Mitigation measures shall be consistent with the General Plan of the city of San Ramon, or amendments thereto. 
2.  Improvement Plans and Cost Estimates. A detailed sketch of each mitigation measure identified in this subsection and approved by the department shall be provided together with preliminary cost estimates. The sketch shall show the length, width, right-of-way and pertinent geometric features of the proposed improvements. 
(Ord. 164 § 2 (part), 1989: prior code § C1-57) 
C4-4. - Determination of mitigation contributions. 
    The determination of project fees for traffic impacts shall be based on the need to mitigate project-related impacts, and the need to mitigate cumulative project impacts through the implementation of the General Plan Traffic and Circulation Element. Project-related mitigation contributions shall be provided to the city based on one or more of the following conditions: 
A.  Traffic Impact Mitigation Fee Requirements. All projects shall pay TIM fees, as set forth in Chapter II of this division. 
B.  Reimbursement Agreement Location. A project impacting an intersection under an existing reimbursement agreement shall provide payment to the city on a percentage base of the original intersection improvement cost in proportion to the project impacts, as outlined in Section C4-5 of this chapter. 
C.  Roadway Improvement Agreement. The developer shall enter into an agreement providing for the construction of all off-site and/or project related on-site improvements within the public right-of-way, as identified in the traffic study. Assurance of mitigation improvements shall be provided in accordance with Section C4-5 of this chapter. 
D.  Improvements in Excess of Base Level Improvements. If a traffic study identifies improvements in excess of base level improvements, then the developer shall provide payment to the city for implementation of the same in proportion to project impacts. 
E.  Request for Inclusion in the City Capital Improvements Program. Project mitigation requiring major improvements may be included in the city's Capital Improvements Program by written request to the community development department. Written request shall include a detailed description of the improvements requested, conceptual plans and cost estimates. If the city council amends the Capital Improvements Program to include project mitigations, the developer will enter into an agreement with the city providing for improvement funding assurance. 
F.  Project Exceptions to Mitigation Requirements.

Chapter II - Traffic Impact Mitigation Fees 

C4-11. - Purpose. 
    This chapter is enacted for the purpose of establishing the traffic mitigation fee to defray the actual cost of constructing roadway improvements within the city which are needed to accommodate the cumulative traffic impacts caused by all new development. It is also the purpose of this chapter to establish an equitable fee and administrative program to assure that each new development bears the burden of its individual, incremental share of improvements needed to accommodate the cumulative traffic impacts caused by all new development. The fee shall be for traffic improvements over and above any improvements required to mitigate project-specific impacts as defined in this chapter. 
(Prior code § C1-70) 
C4-12. - Definitions.

(Prior code § C1-78) 
C4-16. - Calculation. 
A.  Calculation of Fee. The traffic impact mitigation fee shall be calculated in accordance with the following procedure and as established by the fee resolution adopted by the city council in conjunction with this chapter: 
1.  Determine the total transportation improvement cost as defined in Section C4-12. 
2.  Determine the total estimated peak-hour traffic generation from the projected development as follows: 
a.  Determine the number of projected development units from current land use data, as prepared by the planning department, taking into account development that has occurred since time of last update. 
b.  Establish the appropriate p.m. peak-hour trip generation rate for specific land use categories, as defined in Section C4-12 of this chapter. Data from the current Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Manual and any other applicable studies is to be used in the determination of appropriate trip rates given specific land use categories. In the case where the defined trip rate for a land use is questionable, a public works department designee with a valid California Traffic Engineer Registration will make a final determination as to the appropriate trip rate applicable to such use. 
c.  The total estimated p.m. peak-hour traffic generation from projected development is the sum of the products of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this subsection. 
3.  Determine the cost per p.m. peak-hour trip by dividing the total transportation improvement cost by the total estimated p.m. peak-hour traffic generation. 
4.  Determine the cost per dwelling unit or per 1,000 gross square feet of floor area by multiplying the cost per p.m. peak-hour trip by the number of trips generated by each dwelling unit or per 1,000 gross square feet of floor area, and by the respective trip demand factor according to land use. 
B.  Required Fee. The traffic impact mitigation fee required of any project shall be calculated by adding the administrative charge to the cost per dwelling unit or per 1,000 gross square feet. The required fee is then multiplied by the total number of dwelling units or 1,000 gross square feet of floor area to determine the total traffic impact mitigation fees payable for any project. 
(Ord. No. 469, § 2, 9-27-2016; Prior code § C1-79) 
C4-17. - Review. 
    Every five years, or more often as deemed necessary, the public works department shall review the estimated cost of described capital improvements, the continued need for those improvements and the reasonable relationship between such need and the impacts of the various types of development pending or anticipated and for which this fee is charged. The planning department shall be responsible for updating the land use inventory. The planning department shall report the findings to the public works department and the city council for the purpose of determining whether any adjustment to this fee or other action may be needed to ensure that the traffic impact mitigation fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the cost of roadway improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes associated with increased development and growth. 
(Ord. No. 469, § 3, 9-27-2016; Prior code § C1-80) 
C4-18. - Payment of fee. 
A.  For residential developments which require a building permit, the fee shall be paid prior to the date of issuance of a building permit or as authorized and determined by the city under Government Code Section 66066. 
B.  For nonresidential developments the fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit, and no such permit shall be issued until said fees are paid. 
C.  For new development not requiring a building permit the fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a zoning permit or final occupancy. 
D.  In cases where the required fee was not collected prior to issuance of a building or zoning permit, or final occupancy, the fee is still payable and due as of the date of issuance of said permit or occupancy. 
(Prior code § C1-82) 
C4-19. - In-lieu contribution.

A.  In-lieu credit may be given where discretionary approval of a specific development results in improvements that are included in the capital improvement program, except: 
1.  Improvements required that may be temporary in nature, or may have to be relocated, altered or removed in the future shall not be eligible for consideration as an in-lieu contribution; 
2.  Improvements required that exceed the improvements in the capital improvement program, that are necessary to accommodate a specific development shall not be eligible for consideration as an in-lieu contribution. 
B.  If an assessment district or special taxing district is established for all or part of the area subject to this chapter to fund circulation improvements which are or will be funded in whole or in part by the fee established by this chapter, the owner or developer of a project may apply to the city council for an in-lieu credit against the fee in an amount equal to the assessment or taxes paid. 
C.  Acceptance of all proposed in-lieu contributions shall be subject to approval of the city council on appeal or review.

Chapter IIA - Road Improvement and Transportation Fees 
Article 1 - Southern Contra Costa Regional and Subregional Fees for Road Improvements 

C4-26. - Purpose. 
    This chapter provides for the imposition of fees to be collected for the purpose of funding road improvements from proposed developments located within the city of San Ramon and within the Southern Contra Costa (SCC) fee areas (SCC Regional and SCC Subregional). 
A.  This chapter is enacted, in part, pursuant to Government Code Section 66484 and pursuant to the procedure set forth in Government Code Sections 54986, 65091, 66016, 66017, and 66484. All required notices have been properly given and public hearings held. 
B.  The purpose of the fees described in this chapter is to generate funds to finance improvements to certain major thoroughfares in the Southern Contra Costa area. The fees will be used to finance the road improvements listed in the development program report. There is a reasonable relationship between the fees and the types of development projects that are subject to the fees in that the development projects will generate additional traffic on the major thoroughfares in the Southern Contra Costa area, thus creating a need to expand, extend or improve the existing major thoroughfares and a need to construct new major thoroughfares to mitigate adverse traffic and infrastructure impacts that would otherwise result from such development projects. The fees imposed hereunder are in addition to the traffic impact mitigation fee provided for under Chapter II, Division C4 of this code in that each fee is utilized to fund different roadway improvements. 
C.  The Southern Contra Costa ("SCC") fee areas are areas for which development programs have been designed to improve the capacity and safety of the arterial and regional road network through the establishment of a series of traffic mitigation fee ordinances. The SCC joint exercise of powers agreement ("JEPA") is between Contra Costa County ("county"), the town of Danville ("town") and the city of San Ramon ("city") and is an agreement concerning the collection and distribution of these fees. The development program report, as well as the JEPA, detail the basis for the collection of these fees. Similar ordinances implementing the JEPA have been adopted by the county and town. 
D.  The Dougherty Valley settlement agreement between the town of Danville, Contra Costa County and the city of San Ramon called for several processes through which development within Dougherty Valley would be governed and the impact of such development would be mitigated. The SCC JEPA establishes one such process, a traffic mitigation fee program to finance road improvements identified in the settlement agreement as necessary to mitigate the traffic impact created by development within Dougherty Valley. The Dougherty Valley fee is one component of the SCC fees and is assessed to all development that occurs in Dougherty Valley. The total cost of the projects identified in the settlement agreement is approximately thirty-six million dollars. The fair share [as determined by the South County Traffic Study Year 2010 Traffic Impacts for Additional Land Use Alternatives ("South County traffic study")] attributable to development within Dougherty Valley is approximately thirty-one million dollars. 
    The remaining unfunded cost of the projects identified in the settlement agreement is approximately five million dollars. Besides identifying the project cost share attributable to development in Dougherty Valley, the South County traffic study also identified the responsibility for new development in the area outside of Dougherty Valley. This share of the funding responsibility, along with the estimates of development potential in the area (regions within the county, town and city) determine the SCC Subregional fee, another component of the SCC fees. 
(Ord. 288 § 1 (part), 1996) 
C4-27. - Fee Adoption. 
    The following fees set forth in Table C4-27 to fund road improvements are adopted for the SCC fee areas. 
Table C4-27 
SCC SUBREGIONAL FEE 
Land Use Fee Single family residential $2,128 per dwelling unit Other $2,128 per peak hour trip  
SCC REGIONAL FEE 
Land Use Fee Single family residential $792 per dwelling unit Commercial $0.79 per sq. ft. gross floor area Office $1.27 per sq. ft. gross floor area Other $792 per peak hour trip  
    The entire city of San Ramon is located within both the regional fee and subregional fee areas. 
    The boundaries of the SCC fee areas which include unincorporated area and portions of the town of Danville, are established by the SCC JEPA. 
(Ord. 288 § 1 (part), 1996) 
C4-28. - Review of Fees. 
    While the SCC fee areas are in effect, the project cost estimates shall be reviewed periodically. The fee schedule of Table C4-27 shall adjust on March 1st by the change in the Engineering News-Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the period ending December 31st of the preceding calendar year. 
(Ord. 288 § 1 (part), 1996) 
Article 2 - Tri-Valley Transportation Development Fee 

C4-29.01. - Purpose. 
    This article provides for the imposition of fees to be collected for the purpose of funding transportation improvements provided for under a joint exercise of powers of agreement entered into by the cities of San Ramon, Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton, Town of Danville and the counties of Contra Costa and Alameda. 
A.  This ordinance is enacted pursuant to Government Code Sections 66016 and 66017. All required notices have been properly given and public hearings held. 
B.  The purpose of the fee described in this article is to generate funds to finance transportation improvements within the Tri-Valley area. The fee will be used to finance the transportation improvements listed in the joint exercise of powers of agreement. There is a reasonable relationship between the fee and the types of development projects that are subject to the fee in that the development projects will generate additional traffic impacting the Tri-Valley area, thus creating a need to expand, extend or improve existing major thoroughfares and a need to undertake other transportation projects identified in the JEPA to mitigate adverse traffic and infrastructure impacts that would otherwise result from such new development. The fee imposed hereunder is in addition to the traffic impact mitigation fee provided for under Chapter II, Division C4 of the Municipal Code as well as the Southern Contra Costa regional and subregional fees provided for under Article 1 of Chapter IIA, Division C4 in that each fee is utilized to fund different transportation improvements. 
(Ord. 302 § 4 (part), 1998) 
C4-29.02. - Fee Adoption. 
    The following fees to fund transportation improvements are adopted and shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit. 
Land Use Type Fee Per Unit Single-family residential $2,181 Dwelling unit Multifamily residential $1,387 Dwelling unit Office $3.91 Square foot of gross floor area Retail $1.46 Square foot of gross floor area Industrial $2.65 Square foot of gross floor area Other uses $2,181 Average a.m./p.m. peak hour trip Affordable housing $0 Dwelling unit  
*Note: Peak-hour trips will be determined from the latest revision to the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual or other rate schedule as agreed to by the TVTC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may provide in their implementing ordinance or resolution that an applicant for a Land Use Entitlement who is dissatisfied with the number of peak-hour trips, as calculated by the Party, may appeal the determination to the Party's legislative body. If such an appeal is granted by the Party, and the Party adjusts the number of peak-hour trips, the Party shall have such decision ratified by five members of the TVTC. Absent such ratification, the Party shall pay the difference between the actual fee imposed and the fee set forth in this Section 9 or the Party shall notify the applicant that the full amount of the fee must be paid by the applicant. 
(Ord. 323 § 1, 1999: Ord. 302 § 4 (part), 1998) 
(Ord. No. 422, § 2, 1-26-2010) 
C4-29.03. - Fee Implementation. 
    Implementation of the fee established by this article shall conform to provisions of the joint exercise of powers agreement described in Section C4-29.01 of this article. The JEPA was approved by the city of San Ramon on May 12, 1998. 
(Ord. 302 § 4 (part), 1998) 
C4-29.04. - Senior Housing. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abridge or modify the council's discretion, upon proper application for senior housing or congregate care facilities pursuant to Government Code Section 65915.5, to adjust or waive the fees provided for under either Article 1 or Article 2 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 302 § 4 (part), 1998) 
C4-29.05. - Severability. 
    If any fee or provision of this chapter is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that holding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining fees or provisions, and the council declares that it would have adopted each part of Article 1 and Article 2 irrespective of the validity of any other part. 
(Ord. 302 § 4 (part), 1998) 
Chapter III - Tree Preservation Regulations (Reserved) 

C4-31 through C4-40. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 407, § 2, adopted Nov. 25, 2008, repealed Ch. III in its entirety. Former Ch. III pertained to tree preservation regulations and derived from Ord. No. 188, § 1, adopted 1990. 
Chapter IIIA - Community Forestry Program 

C4-40.01. - Purpose. 
    The city of recognizes that trees abate noise and air pollution, favorably modify micro-climates, reduce soil erosion and runoff, protect against flood hazards and risk of landslides, enhance the visual environment, encourage quality development, and provide a source of community pride. The city desires that trees located along city streets and on public property be planted and maintained in such a manner that the public fully realizes these and other benefits, and that the city's commitment to creating and maintaining the urban forest be recognized by designation as a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation. The standards governing the Tree City USA designation process require the adoption of a community tree ordinance that designates a tree board or department with responsibility for writing and implementing the annual community forestry work plan and provides for public tree care policies for planting, maintenance, and removals. In addition to meeting the standards necessary for Tree City USA designation, requiring the development and implementation of an annual community forestry work plan will ensure the continuation of: public tree planting and maintenance integrated with other urban elements and amenities; efficient, cost-effective and reliable management of and funding for the city's urban forest; and, reductions in public hazards, nuisances and expenses occasioned by improper tree selection, planting and maintenance. For these reasons, the city council finds it is necessary and desirable to enact regulations for managing the city's public trees. It is the intent of this chapter to assign responsibility for developing and implementing an annual work plan for the city's public trees and to provide for the development of associated policies, and to encourage the public participation in these processes.

    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 414, §§ 1, 2, 4-28-2009) 
C4-48. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. 
"Area of special flood hazard" - see "Special flood hazard area". 
"Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the one hundred-year flood). 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
"Breakaway wall" is any type of wall, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions: 
1.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
2.  The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood. 
"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of floodwaters, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this subsection. 
"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway. 
"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the city.

"Hardship" as related to this ordinance means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic Structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

"New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by this city. 
"Nuisance" means for purposes of Section C4-81D5 that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons." 
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" means a flood which has a one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the "base flood," which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AO, AI-30, AE, A99 or AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

2.  That all other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  That the site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  That the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of the floodway. For purposes of this chapter "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot any point. 
The administrator shall be entitled to impose conditions in approving any permit. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include determining "Market Value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by city staff. 
C.  Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section C4-43, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Article 3 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify any adjacent city or Contra Costa County for unincorporated areas and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMRs for flood control projects for new developments are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the city clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Obtain and Maintain for Public Inspection and Make Available as Needed: 
1.  The certification required in Section C4-67A; 
2.  The certification required in Section C4-67B; 
3.  The certification required in Section C4-67(C)(3);

D.  Findings. In order to grant a variance the floodplain administrator must make all of the following findings: 
1.  That good and sufficient cause exists; 
2.  That failure to grant the variance would cause the applicant "exceptional hardship" as defined in this chapter; 
3.  That granting the variance will not increase flood levels during the base flood discharge within a mapped regulatory floodway;

E.  Historic Structure Exemption. The floodplain administrator may grant a variance for the repair or rehabilitation of a "historic structure" as defined in section C4-49 on the sole finding that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
F.  Notice to Applicant. Every applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that (a) issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level may result in a significant increase in premium rates for flood insurance and (b) construction below the base flood level increases the risk to life and property.

7.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the planning commission may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby granted to the planning commission to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.

Chapter X - Parkland Dedication[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 482, § 1, adopted Sept. 11, 2018, repealed former Ch. X, §§ C5-141-C5-155, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Ch. X pertained to similar subject matter an d derived from Ord. No. 406, § 2, adopted Oct. 28, 2008. 

C5-141. - Purpose of provisions. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code of the State of California. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this chapter are in accordance with the parks and recreation element of the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-142. - General requirements. 
A.  As a condition of approval of a tentative subdivision map, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. The condition shall be determined by the advisory agency after considering the recommendation of the parks and community services director and/or the parks and community services commission. 
B.  The San Ramon 2035 General Plan establishes a standard for functional parkland of six and one-half acres per one thousand residents. Government Code Section 66477 limits the ability of the city in approving a tentative subdivision map to requiring dedication of land, payment of in-lieu fees, or a combination of both, to the amount necessary to provide three acres per one thousand persons unless existing park area within the city exceeds that standard in which case a higher standard not to exceed five acres per one thousand persons may be applied. Functional parkland within the City of San Ramon exceeds five acres per one thousand persons. Accordingly, the formula for dedication of land and the calculation of in-lieu fees set forth in this chapter shall be based upon the standard of providing 4.91 acres of functional parkland for each one thousand persons. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-143. - Formula for dedication of land. 
A.  Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in or is consistent with policies and standards in the parks and recreation element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the formula set out in subsection B of this section. 
B.  The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows: 
A = 4.91xN/1,000 
Where "A" is the park area required to be dedicated in acres and "N" is the average number of persons per household or unit according to the "most recent available federal census or a census taken pursuant to Chapter 17 (commencing with Section 40200) of Part 2 of Division 3 of Title 4." (Government Code Section 66477(a)(2).) 
For purposes of calculating the land dedication requirement, persons per multi-family and per single-family household are estimated at 2.11 and 3.21, respectively, based on 5-year American Communities Survey of 2012. 
Single Family Units 687 sq. ft. of land Multi-Family Units 451 sq. ft. of land  
  
    As more recent census data becomes available, the planning director may compute the dedication requirement using the most recent available census data as stipulated herein. 
C.  The dedicated land shall be delivered to the city as an improved parcel conforming primarily to the off-site improvements required for the subdivision. Offsite improvements essential to the acceptance of land for dedication include but are not limited to: 
1.  Full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, street lighting, curb, gutter and sidewalk to land which is dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Fencing along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land. 
3.  Extension of utility lines. 
4.  Improved drainage through the site. 
5.  The provision of other minimal improvements which the city council determines to be essential to the acceptance of land for residential purposes. 
D.  For the purpose of this section, the number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the approved tentative map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone. 
E.  In the case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term "new dwelling unit" does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is filed. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-144. - Calculation of in-lieu fees. 
A.  General Formula. If the advisory agency determines that dedication of land is not appropriate, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of a local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section C5-143. The fee shall be computed in accord with the formula set forth in Subsection D below. 
B.  Fees In Lieu of Land-Fifty Parcels or fewer. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or fewer, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section C5-143 of this chapter and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivision D of this section. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in subdivisions of fifty parcels or fewer where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the advisory agency and city council. 
C.  Use of Money. The money collected hereunder shall be held in the city's Park Improvement Fund and shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new, or rehabilitating existing, park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision or greater San Ramon community. 
D.  When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section C5-143, referred to in Section C5-143(C) of this chapter plus two percent for administration cost. The fee computation shall assume based on the fair market value of buildable land as determined by Section C5-146. For the purposes of this chapter, "buildable land" is defined as typical subdivision acreage, with a slope of less than fifteen percent, and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements or other restrictions. 
In-Lieu Fee Single Family Units Appraised Value of 687 sq. ft. of land × 1.02 Multi-Family Units Appraised Value of 451 sq. ft. of land × 1.02  
  
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-145. - Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. 
    If for any reason, the advisory agency determines on a subdivision of more than fifty parcels that only a portion of the land otherwise required to be dedicated under Section C5-143 be actually dedicated, the value of the additional land shall be paid through an in-lieu fee computed in accordance with Section C5-144. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-146. - Determination of fair market value. 
A.  The fair market value shall be determined by the planning director with a written appraisal report prepared and signed by an appraiser acceptable to the city. The appraisal shall be made immediately prior to the filing of the final map, and the cost of the appraisal shall be paid for by the subdivider. The subdivider shall notify the city of the expected filing date at least six weeks prior to filing of the final map. If more than one year elapses prior to filing of the final map, the city will prepare a new appraisal and will bill the subdivider for the cost of the reappraisal. For the purposes of this chapter, the determination of the fair market value of buildable land, as defined in Subsection C5-144(D) of this chapter shall consider, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
1.  Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map; 
2.  The general plan; 
3.  Zoning; 
4.  Property location; 
5.  Off-site improvements facilitating use of the property, if any; and 
6.  Site characteristics of the property. 
B.  At any time prior to final map approval, the subdivider may appeal the determination of fair market value to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-147. - Determination of land or fee. 
    Whether the city council requires land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
A.  The natural features, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication. 
B.  The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication. 
C.  The feasibility of dedication. 
D.  The compatibility of dedication with the general plan of the city. 
E.  The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. 
    The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-148. - Credit for private open space. 
    No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space usable for active recreational purposes is provided in a proposed common interest development as defined in Civil Code Section 1351, partial credit, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent, shall be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the advisory agency finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met: 
A.  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space. 
B.  Private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by a homeowners' association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a one hundred percent affirmative vote of the membership, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for proportionate share of expenses for maintaining facilities. 
C.  Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor. 
D.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location. 
E.  Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the parks and recreation element of the general plan. 
F.  The open space for which credit is given is generally a minimum of three acres and provides one or more of the local park basic elements listed in this subsection, or a combination of such other recreation improvements that will meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area as determined by the advisory agency: 
1.  Recreational open spaces, which are generally defined as park areas for active recreation pursuits such as soccer, golf, baseball, softball and football and have at least one acre of maintained turf with less than a five percent slope. 
2.  Court areas, which are generally defined as tennis courts, badminton courts, shuffleboard courts or similar hard-surfaced areas especially designed and exclusively used for court games. 
3.  Recreation swimming areas, which are defined generally as fenced areas devoted primarily to swimming, diving or bathhouses, or other facilities developed and used exclusively for swimming and diving and consisting of no less than fifteen square feet of water surface area for each three percent of the population of the subdivision with a minimum of eight hundred square feet of water surface area per pool together with adjacent deck and/or lawn area twice that of the pool. 
4.  Recreation buildings and facilities designed and primarily used for the recreational needs of residents of the development. 
5.  Trailheads and trails that connect neighborhoods, and are accessible to the public. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-149. - Payment of fees. 
    Fees shall be paid proportionately as each building permit is issued. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-150. - Disposition of fees. 
    Fees determined pursuant to Subsection C5-144(D) of this chapter shall be paid to the city treasurer and shall be deposited into the park improvement fund or its successor. Money in the fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition or development of park land, or improvements related thereto. Collected fees shall be appropriated by the local agency to which the land or fees are conveyed or paid for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five years upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. 
    If such fees are not so committed, these fees shall be distributed and paid to the then recorded owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lots bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision. 
    The city treasurer shall report to the city council at least annually on income, expenditures and status of the subdivision Park Improvement Fund. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-151. - Exemptions. 
A.  Subdivisions containing four or fewer parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. 
B.  The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions, nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old and when no new dwelling units are added. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-152. - Credit for improvements provided by subdivider. 
    The value of park and recreation improvements provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land shall be credited against the fees or dedication of land required by this chapter. The city council reserves the right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-153. - Conveyance of land or fees. 
    Land or fees required under this chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the local public agency which provides park and recreational services on a community-wide level and to the area within which the proposed development will be located, if such agency elects to accept the land or fee. At the time of tentative map approval, the advisory agency shall determine whether the city is the appropriate local public agency. The city, county or other local public agency to which the land or fees are conveyed or paid shall develop a schedule pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code specifying how, when and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision or greater San Ramon community. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-154. - Access to streets. 
    All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the advisory agency if the advisory agency determines that public street access is unnecessary for the maintenance of the park area or use thereof by residents. 
(Ord. No. 482, § 1, 9-11-2018) 
C5-155. - Change of site. 
    If during the ensuing time between dedication of land for park purposes and commencement of first-stage development, circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional park land or a change in school location), the land may be sold upon the approval of the city council with the resultant funds being used for purchase of a more suitable site.

Chapter XI - Improvements 

C5-161. - Generally. 
A.  The subdivider shall construct all required improvements, both on-site and off-site, in accordance with standard engineering plans and specifications, engineering design and improvement standards and other approved standards as provided by this chapter. 
B.  No final or parcel map shall be presented to the council for approval until the subdivider either completes the required improvements or enters into a subdivision improvement agreement pursuant to Government Code Section 66462(a) for final map improvements or a deferred improvement agreement pursuant to Section C5-163 of this division for parcel map improvements. 
(Ord. No. 406, § 2, 10-28-2008) 
C5-162. - Improvements required. 
A.  General. All improvements as may be required as conditions of approval of the tentative map or by city ordinance or resolution, together with, but not limited to, the required improvements set forth below shall be required of all subdivisions. Requirements for construction of on-site and off-site improvements for subdivisions of four or fewer parcels shall be noted on the parcel map, waiver of parcel map, or the deferred improvement agreement recorded prior to or concurrent with the parcel map. 
B.  Frontage Improvements. The frontage of each lot shall be improved to its ultimate adopted geometric section, including street structural section, curbs, sidewalks, driveway approaches and transitions. A cross mark that identifies the extension of the property line shall be placed on top of the street curb for each lot. 
C.  Storm Drainage. Stormwater runoff from the subdivision shall be collected and conveyed by an approved storm drain system. The storm drain system shall be designed for ultimate development of the watershed. The storm drain system shall provide for the protection of abutting and off-site properties that would be adversely affected by any increase in runoff attributed to the development. Off-site storm drain improvements may be required to satisfy this requirement. Appropriate hydrology and hydraulic studies shall be submitted to the city engineer identifying size, location and impacts of such facilities. 
D.  Sanitary Sewers. Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served by a sanitary sewer system as approved by local sanitation district. 
E.  Water Supply. Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served by a domestic water system as approved by local water district. 
F.  Utilities. Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served by gas (if required), electric, telephone and cablevision facilities. 
G.  Underground Utilities. 
1.  All existing and proposed utility distribution facilities within the subdivision and along frontage and perimeter streets shall be placed underground except those facilities exempted by the public utilities commission regulations. 
a.  Utility distribution facilities, including but not limited to electric, communication, street lighting and advanced technology systems installed in and for the purpose of supplying service to any development, shall be required to be placed underground. "Advanced technology systems" shall be defined as all necessary appurtenances, equipment and facilities required for the provision of Internet, computer, fiber optic, cable television, telephone, and other communication services within the public right-of-way and upon private property. The design, installation, inspection and testing requirements for city acceptance of such systems shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in the City of San Ramon standard plans and specifications as approved by the city engineer. 
b.  All existing facilities except transmission facilities either along abutting streets or within a development shall also be underground at the time of development. "Along abutting streets" means on the same side of the abutting street as the property being developed, not the other side of the street. 
c.  The developer is responsible for complying with all requirements of this subsection, and shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies for the installation of such facilities. 
d.  All costs of placing existing or new facilities, required to be undergrounded by the developer, shall be paid for by the developer subject to the current California Public Utility Commission rules and regulations. 
2.  The developer may request that the undergrounding requirement along frontage streets or perimeter streets be waived or modified by the advisory agency. The advisory agency may, at its discretion: 
a.  Require participation in a future underground district. 
b.  Accept a fee in lieu of the undergrounding. The amount of the fee shall be determined by the city engineer and shall be based on the estimated cost of that portion of a future undergrounding project attributable to the subdivision. 
3.  Undergrounding requirements may be waived or modified by the advisory agency only upon finding that the subdivision is within an area where existing utilities have not been placed underground and that deferral will be allowed since undergrounding is impractical due to physical constraints (such as unusual topographical or soil constraints), the surrounding neighborhood is absent of similar improvements, or undergrounding is economically infeasible. 
4.  If the undergrounding requirement is waived as allowed by findings, the in lieu fee as established by the city engineer shall be made a condition of approval of the tentative map. In lieu fees shall be deposited in a special account to be used as approved by the city council for future undergrounding of utilities throughout the city. 
5.  If the requirement to underground utilities is waived and an in lieu fee is not paid, the advisory agency may require the recordation of an improvement agreement, requiring the property owner and any subsequent owner of the subject property to join an underground utility assessment district, reimbursement district or similar improvement district, when such a district is formed, and to guarantee participation in such district by posting an improvement bond and recording a lien on subject property. 
H.  Stormwater Control Improvements. Project design and improvement infrastructure is in compliance with the Regional Water Quality Control Board Clean Water General Permit requirements for both construction activities as well as permanent stormwater best management practice measures to control and reduce erosion and sedimentation from entering the storm drain system from the project site (point source). 
I.  Other Improvements. Other types of improvements such as traffic signals and street furniture of a decorative nature, or fees in lieu of any of the foregoing, shall also be required as determined by the advisory agency in accordance with this code, city standards and specifications and relevant studies and/or environmental assessments or reviews. 
J.  Off-Site Improvements. 
1.  If the subdivider is required to construct off-site improvements on land in which neither the subdivider nor the city has sufficient title or interest to allow construction, the city shall, within one hundred eighty calendar days of filing the final map, acquire by negotiation or commence condemnation of the land. If the city fails to meet the one hundred twenty-day time limit, the condition for the construction shall be conclusively deemed to be waived. 
2.  Prior to approval of the final or parcel map, the city may require the subdivider to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement to complete the off-site improvements at the time the city acquires title or an interest in the land. The subdivider shall pay the cost of acquiring off-site land or an interest in the land required to construct the off-site improvements. 
3.  Any other specific requirements related to off-site improvements shall be in compliance with Government Code Section 66462.5. 
K.  Reimbursement. The city may impose a requirement that the improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision shall contain supplemental sizes, capacity, or number or length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, and that such improvements be dedicated to the city. When the city imposes such a requirement, the city shall enter into a reimbursement agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to differences between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements plus an amount attributable to interest. The city, at the time of acceptance of the improvements, may make provision for collection of the city's share of the cost of such improvements in accordance with the provisions of Government Code Sections 66487, 66488, and 66489. 
L.  The city council shall determine the method for payment of the costs required by a reimbursement agreement which may include but is not limited to the establishment and maintenance of local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefited. 
M.  No charge, area of benefit or local benefit district shall be established unless and until a public hearing is held thereon by the city council and the city council finds that the charge, area of benefit or local benefit district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof. 
N.  In addition to the notice required by section C5-6 of this division, written notice of the hearing shall be mailed to those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they can be ascertained at the time ten calendar days prior to the date of the hearing). 
(Ord. No. 406, § 2, 10-28-2008) 
C5-163. - Deferred improvement agreements. 
    Subdivisions of Four or Fewer Parcels. A deferred improvement agreement shall be entered into between subdivider and the city requiring construction of improvements required by the tentative map conditions of approval and not completed prior to approval of the parcel map. Any of the forms of security specified in Government Code Section 66499 may be required at the discretion of the city engineer. The terms of the deferred agreement must comply with Government Code Section 66411.1 but otherwise shall be determined by the city engineer. All deferred improvement agreements shall contain the following provisions in addition to those required by the city engineer: 
A.  Construction of improvements shall commence within a time-frame specified in the agreement. 
B.  That in the event of a default by the subdivider and/or owner, the city is authorized to cause construction to be done and charge the entire cost and expense to the subdivider and/or owner, including interest from the date of notice of said cost and expense until paid. 
C.  That the agreement shall be recorded with the county recorder at the expense of the subdivider and/or owner and shall constitute notice to all successors and assigns of title to the real property of the obligations set forth therein, and shall also constitute a lien in such amount necessary to fully reimburse the city, including interest as provided above, subject to foreclosure in the event of a default in payment. 
D.  That in event of litigation occasioned by any default of the subdivider and/or owner, the subdivider and/or owner agree to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and that the same shall become a part of the lien against the real property. 
E.  That the terms "subdivider" and "owner" shall include, respectively, not only the subdivider and the present owner of the real property but also heirs, successors, executors, administrator and assigns thereof, it being the intent of the parties that the obligations undertaken shall run with the real property and constitute a lien against it. 
    The agreement shall not relieve the subdivider or owner from any other specific requirements of the Subdivision Map Act, this code or law. The construction of deferred improvements shall conform to the provisions of this chapter and all applicable provisions of this code in effect at the time of construction. 
    This section shall also apply to remainder parcels. 
(Ord. No. 406, § 2, 10-28-2008)

(Ord. No. 406, § 2, 10-28-2008) 
C5-165. - Access. 
A.  All lots or parcels created shall have access to a public street improved to city standards. If the advisory agency determines that the most logical development of the land requires that lots be created with access to private streets, such a development may be approved. The subdivider shall submit a development plan showing the alignment, width, grade and material specifications of any proposed private street, the topography and means of access to each lot, and the drainage and sewerage of the lots served by such private street. Construction and private street maintenance agreement by parties using street shall be completed prior to the completion of the construction and/or occupancy of the lots, unless approved otherwise by the city engineer. The subdivider shall be required to provide a feasible method for the maintenance of such private streets. 
B.  Reserve strips, or nonaccess at the end of streets or at the boundaries of subdivisions, shall be dedicated to the city when so required. 
(Ord. No. 406, § 2, 10-28-2008) 
C5-166. - Improvement plans. 
A.  General. Improvement plans shall be prepared under the direction of, and signed by, a registered civil engineer licensed by the State of California, and shall conform to the City of San Ramon Engineering Design and Improvement Standards on file with the city engineer.

C6-15. - Term-Completion of work. 
    The permittee shall complete the work or use authorized by a permit within the time specified in the permit.

(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
Article 4 - Requirements

    The permittee, in the conduct of the work, use, or maintenance of an encroachment authorized by a permit issued under this division, shall provide, erect or maintain the lights, barriers, warning signs, patrols, watchmen and other safeguards necessary to protect the traveling public. Any omission on the part of the city engineer to specify in the permit what lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices shall be provided, erected or maintained by the permittee, or the fact that the city engineer may not specify sufficient lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices, shall not excuse the permittee from complying with all requirements of law and appropriate regulations and ordinances for adequately protecting the safety of the traveling public. If at any time the city engineer finds that suitable safeguards are not being provided, the city may provide, erect, maintain, relocate or remove the safeguards deemed necessary or may cancel the permit and restore the right-of-way to its former condition, all at the expense of the permittee. A permittee making any excavation or leaving any obstruction within, under or on the right-of-way, or causing the same to be made, erected or left, shall place and maintain lights at each end of the excavation or obstruction, at not more than fifty-five-foot intervals along the excavation or obstruction, from one-half hour before sunset of each day to one-half hour after sunrise of the next day, until the excavation is entirely refilled or the obstruction removed and the right-of-way made safe for use. In addition, reflectorized warning signs conforming to the requirements of the California Division of Highways shall be placed two hundred and four hundred feet from each excavation or obstruction, in a position adequately to warn public traffic. The warning signs, lights and other safety devices shall conform to the requirements of Section 21406 of the Vehicle Code of the state and of any sign manual issued by the department of public works of the state.

The permittee shall remove all obstructions, impediments, material or rubbish caused or placed on the right-of-way and shall do any other work or perform any act necessary to restore the right-of-way to a safe and usable condition, as directed by the city engineer. After completion of all work, the permittee shall exercise reasonable care in inspecting and maintaining the area affected by the encroachment. On notice from the city engineer the permittee shall immediately repair any injury, damage or nuisance in any portion of the right-of-way resulting from the work done under the permit. If the permittee fails to act promptly or if the exigencies of the injury or damage require repairs or replacement to be made before the permittee can be notified or can respond to notice, the city at its option may make the necessary repairs or replacements or perform the necessary work and the permittee shall be charged the actual costs of labor and materials, plus fifteen percent as administrative costs. By acceptance of the permit, the permittee agrees to comply with this section.

When removal or relocation is required, the city engineer shall give the permittee a written demand specifying the place of relocation, or that the installations or encroachment must be removed from the right-of-way, and specifying in the demand a reasonable time within which the encroachment must be removed or relocated. If the permittee fails to comply with instructions, the city may cause the removal or relocation of the encroachment at the expense of the permittee.

C6-36. - Repair work supervision and inspection. 
    All encroachment repair work done under a permit issued under this division shall conform to specifications established by the city engineer or, in the absence of established specifications, to recognized standards of construction and approved practices in connection with such work. All encroachment repair work shall be done subject to approval of the city engineer. Unless otherwise noted on the permit all encroachment repair work performed on any public street or right-of-way under the jurisdiction of the city shall conform to the construction specifications contained in the current edition of the Standard Specifications of the state of California, issued by the Department of Public Works, Division of Highways, as may be amended by special provisions adopted by the city council.

When a pole, guy, stub or similar timber is removed and not replaced, the entire length shall be removed from the ground and the hole backfilled and compacted. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-42. - Aids to visibility. 
    When the location or position of a pole or other obstruction makes accentuation of its visibility to vehicular traffic necessary, the city engineer may require that the pole or other obstruction be painted or equipped with reflectors or other aids to visibility prescribed or authorized by the public utilities commission or the Department of Public Works of the state of California, at the expense of the permittee.

The form shall include, in addition to the other requirements, an agreement by the applicant to maintain the trees in a neat, healthy and safe condition to the satisfaction of the city engineer, and an agreement to remove the trees as directed by the city engineer and to pay the cost of removal on the permittee's failure promptly to remove the trees on direction of the city engineer. The application shall show the exact location and kind of trees to be planted, and no change shall be made either in the location or kind of trees without the written approval of the city engineer. All trees placed in the right-of-way shall be maintained by the permittee or his successor in interest or by some other interested party in a neat, healthy and safe condition to the satisfaction of the city engineer and at no expense to the city. If the encroachment is not located or maintained as specified in this section, the city engineer may direct the permittee to remove the encroachment and restore the right-of-way to its former condition at the expense of the permittee. If the permittee fails promptly to remove the encroachment as directed, the city engineer shall have the right to remove it and collect the cost of removal from the permittee, together with all of the city's costs and expenses in enforcing collection. The city engineer shall refuse to issue a permit authorizing the planting of trees in the right-of-way when in his or her judgment the location as described in the application or the nature of the growth above or below ground of the kind of tree proposed will impede or inconvenience public travel, unduly disturb the right-of-way, interfere with the construction or maintenance of necessary facilities, or interfere with existing pipe lines, utility installations or other facilities lawfully placed within the right-of-way.

No hedge, shrub or other planting whatever or fence or similar structure shall be maintained across any existing walkway in a sidewalk area or shoulder. The intent of this restriction is to keep a walkway free for pedestrian or other lawful public travel without interference by or with vehicular travel. No encroachment will be permitted or maintained which impedes, obstructs or denies pedestrian or other lawful travel within the limits of the right-of-way of a public highway or impairs adequate sight distance for safe pedestrian or vehicular traffic.

However, the lawn or similar ground cover shall not extend into the traveled way nor into the drainage ditches, gutter or other drainage facilities. The general public shall not be denied the use of a planted area for pedestrian travel or other lawful use. The city may use the planted area for any purpose and may issue a permit to any applicant to go on the planted area to perform work or otherwise encroach under this division. If the lawn or similar ground cover is damaged or disturbed in the course of an authorized encroachment, the permittee will be held responsible for the replacement unless the permit specifically states otherwise. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992)

(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
Chapter II - Road Dedication and Improvement 
Article 1 - Intent and Objectives 

C6-61. - Findings-General. 
    In enacting this chapter the city council finds that the city has experienced explosive increases in population and motor vehicle operation, and extensive changes from the former predominantly agricultural uses to land development for high-activity purposes other than agricultural with attendant building construction, which factors directly result in rapidly rendering the present internal road system inadequate in width and development to provide minimum acceptable service capacity to the lands being developed, which inadequacy is growing at an increasing rate. The indirect result of these factors of change and growth is to increasingly tend to deny to the public the use of roads of minimum standards for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and travel between many points inside and outside the city. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-62. - Findings-Cost. 
    This council further finds that the total cost of correcting city street system deficiencies substantially exceeds the total funds available to the city for this purpose, and that unless measures are taken to provide for the orderly and systematic increase in width, capacity and improvement of the city streets when and as the development of land as aforesaid takes place, the citizens of this city will early suffer a condition of blight with pernicious effect upon the economic welfare, public convenience and general prosperity of the city. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-63. - Intention. 
    The provisions of this chapter are intended to define the requirements and procedures for the dedication of right-of-way and the improvement of those streets shown on the circulation element of the general plan of the city in connection with the issuance of building permits or land use permits in certain land use districts in order to accomplish the objectives set forth in Section C6-64. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-64. - Objectives. 
    The objects of these provisions are: 
A.  To ensure conformity to the Subdivision Map Act and to Division C5 of this code, and to extend the application of the basic requirements thereof to land development in which no subdivision is involved; 
B.  To spread the costs of required public improvements upon the abutting properties as contemplated by law; 
C.  To cause the installation of those improvements necessary to properly serve the property developed, at the time of its development, so that the benefitted property may enjoy the use of such improvements throughout the normal life thereof, and so that such improvements are not indefinitely deferred to the detriment of the public interest, safety and welfare; 
D.  To protect the public's vested interest in the preexisting capacity of this city's streets, and to provide a policy for public participation in the widening and improvement of streets and highways when necessitated by development of abutting property; 
E.  To prevent the dissipation or improper use of the city's general operating and maintenance funds in providing these improvements or in maintaining faulty or substandard installations; and 
F.  To protect the public health, safety, living standards and common welfare of the general public. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
Article 2 - Requirements and Exceptions 

C6-65. - Requirements generally. 
    No building or structure shall be erected or enlarged, and no building permit shall be issued therefor, on any lot in any district set forth in Section C6-66 or on any lot where a variance or land use permit is conditioned on compliance with this chapter, if such lot abuts a principal thoroughfare or arterial as shown on circulation element of the general plan, unless the one-half of the planned road which is located on the same side of the road's center (as shown on the plan) as such lot has been dedicated and improved for the full frontage width of the lot, or such dedication and improvement has been assured. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-66. - Applicable zoning districts. 
    This chapter shall be applicable to all zoning districts. 
(Ord. 230 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1992) 
C6-67. - Maximum dedication. 
A.  The maximum area of land required to be dedicated in accordance with this chapter shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the area of any such lot which was of record in the county recorder's office, as of April 1, 1971. 
B.  Unless a variance is granted, no dedication shall be required by this chapter which reduces the lot below: 
1.  The minimum for the zoning district involved; or 
2.  A width of fifty feet; or 
3.  An area of five thousand square feet.

Chapter VI - Sidewalk/Driveway Repair and Replacement 

C6-195. - Intent. 
    There are approximately four hundred and seventy miles of sidewalks maintained by the City of San Ramon. In some instances repair is required as the result of the actions of an adjoining property owner, for example by allowing tree roots to damage the sidewalk. With respect to certain commercial and industrial properties, the volume of vehicle traffic as well as heavy trucks crossing the sidewalk to access the place of business results in damage to the sidewalk and the driveway. 
    The intent of this chapter is to: 
A.  Require that the owners and those in possession of real property adjoining city-owned sidewalks be responsible for maintenance of those sidewalks, including driveways accessing the sidewalk in the case of commercial or industrial properties; and 
B.  Impose liability to the public on such owners for injuries or property damage resulting from failure to maintain the sidewalk in a non-dangerous condition. 
    It is not the intent of this chapter to absolve the City of San Ramon from any liability. This chapter is adopted by the City of San Ramon under its authority as a Charter City. 
(Ord. No. 465, § 1, 6-14-2016) 
C6-196. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
A.  "Owner" means the fee owner of real property and the person in possession of the property. 
B.  "Sidewalk area" means the area between the property line of a parcel and the edge of the street pavement. 
C.  "Maintenance and repair" means all actions necessary to insure that the sidewalk area remain in a condition that is not dangerous to property or persons using the sidewalk area in a reasonable manner and in a condition which does not interfere with the convenience of the public in using the sidewalk area. Such actions include but are not limited to grinding, removal and replacement of sidewalks, repair and maintenance of curb and gutters, removal and filling or replacement of parking strips, tree root pruning, installation of root barriers, trimming shrubs/ground cover and removal of weeds/debris. 
(Ord. No. 465, § 1, 6-14-2016) 
C6-197. - Duty of maintenance and repair. 
    The owner of real property adjoining any portion of a sidewalk area shall maintain and repair the sidewalk area and shall pay the cost of such maintenance and repair. For owners of commercial or industrial properties with driveways crossing sidewalk areas, this obligation shall include any work outside the sidewalk area on the private property of owner or within the adjoining street pavement deemed necessary by city for completing the repair. No owner shall be responsible for damage to the sidewalk area caused by trees owned by the City of San Ramon. 
(Ord. No. 465, § 1, 6-14-2016) 
C6-198. - Liability of owner to public. 
    The owner required under this chapter to maintain and repair a sidewalk area shall owe a duty to members of the public to keep and maintain the sidewalk area in a safe and non-dangerous condition. Failure of an owner to maintain and repair the sidewalk area constitutes negligence and the owner shall be liable for any damage to person or property resulting from that negligence. 
(Ord. No. 465, § 1, 6-14-2016) 
C6-199. - Declaration of public nuisance. 
    Any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to the public health, safety and welfare. Such condition is hereby declared and deemed to be a public nuisance within the provisions of Section B6-161 et seq. of the Municipal Code notwithstanding the fact that the sidewalk area within which the condition exists is public property.

Upon confirmation by the building official that the permit application and supporting documents meets the requirements of the city adopted checklist, and is consistent with all applicable laws and health and safety standards, the building official shall, consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, approve the application and issue all necessary permits. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to energize or utilize the electric vehicle charging station until approval is granted by the city. If the building official determines that the permit application is incomplete, a written correction notice shall be issued to the applicant, detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. 
C.  Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall allow for electronic submittal of permit applications covered by this division and associated supporting documentations. In accepting such permit applications, the building official shall also accept electronic signatures on all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by any applicant. 
(Ord. No. 473, § 1, 10-10-2017) 
C9-5. - Technical review. 
A.  It is the intent of this division to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official's authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the building official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, as defined in this chapter, the city may require the applicant to apply for a use permit. 
B.  In the technical review of a charging station, consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall not condition the approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of such a system by an association, as that term is defined by Civil Code Section 4080. 
(Ord. No. 473, § 1, 10-10-2017) 
C9-6. - Electric vehicle charging station installation requirements. 
A.  Electric vehicle charging station equipment shall meet the requirements of the California Electrical Code, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and accredited testing laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories, and rules of the public utilities commission or a municipal electric utility company regarding safety and reliability. 
B.  Installation of electric vehicle charging stations and associated wiring, bonding, disconnecting means and overcurrent protective devices shall meet the requirements of California Electrical Code Article 625 and all applicable provisions of the California Electrical Code. 
C.  Installation of electric vehicle charging stations shall be incorporated into the load calculations of all new or existing electrical services and shall meet the requirements of the California Electrical Code. Electric vehicle charging equipment shall be considered a continuous load. 
D.  Anchorage of either floor-mounted or wall-mounted electric vehicle charging stations shall meet the requirements of the California Building or Residential Code as applicable per occupancy, and the provisions of the manufacturer's installation instructions. Mounting of charging stations shall not adversely affect building elements.

Purpose and Applicability of Zoning Ordinance D1
Division D1 - Zoning Ordinance Applicability  Effective March 28, 2018 1-4
D1-2 - Authority for the Zoning Ordinance
This Zoning Ordinance is enacted based on the authority vested in the City of San Ramon by the Charter of the City of San Ramon and by the State of California, including the California Constitution, the Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Section 65000 et seq.), and the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.).
D1-3 - Applicability of the Zoning Ordinance
This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses, subdivisions, and development within the City of San Ramon as follows.
A. Application to property. The requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply to all land within the City of San Ramon, including land owned by the City. The requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall apply to property owned by and/or under the jurisdiction of any other local, state, or federal agency to the maximum extent allowed by law. The Zoning Map shall govern the application of regulations to specific lots.
B. New land uses or structures, changes to land uses or structures. It shall be unlawful, and a violation of this Zoning Ordinance for any person to establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure, except in compliance with the requirements of Section D2-2 (General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses), and Chapter D7-I (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels). Issuance of a Building Permit or Grading Permit by the City shall require that the plans for proposed construction comply with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
C. Subdivisions. Each proposed subdivision shall be consistent with the minimum lot size requirements of Division D2 (Allowable Land Uses and Zoning Standards), the City's Subdivision Ordinance, and all applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
D. Continuation of an existing land use. An existing land use is lawful and not in violation of the this Zoning Ordinance only when operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, including Chapter D7-I (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels). However, these requirements do not retroactively apply to a land use that was lawfully established before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or an applicable amendment, except as otherwise provided by Chapter D7-I.
E. Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on a project in progress.
1. Application in process. A planning permit application (see Division D6 - Planning Permit Procedures) that has been accepted by the Department as complete prior to the effective date of a Zoning Ordinance amendment is subject to the Zoning Ordinance requirements in effect as of the date that the application is deemed complete. Any project revisions or amendment to a permit application, that has been previously deemed complete, shall be subject to the Zoning Ordinance requirements in effect as of the date that the proposed project revisions are deemed complete. Each planning permit application shall be processed in compliance with the requirements of the California Permit Streamlining Act (PSA).
2. Project under construction. A project that is under construction on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment, need not be changed to satisfy a new or different requirement of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the approved use of the site shall be established, including the completion of all structures and other features of the project as shown on the approved permit, before the expiration of the permit, or applicable time extension.
Purpose and Applicability of Zoning Ordinance D1
Division D1 - Zoning Ordinance Applicability  Effective March 28, 2018 1-5
F. Minimum requirements. The requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When this Zoning Ordinance provides for discretion on the part of a City official or body, discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements than those in this Zoning Ordinance as may be determined by the review authority to be necessary to promote appropriate land use and development, environmental resource protection, and the other purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.
G. Conflicting requirements.
1. Zoning Ordinance and Municipal Code or Building Code provisions. If a conflict occurs between requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, or between this Zoning Ordinance and requirements of the San Ramon Municipal Code, the Building Code, or other regulations of the City, the most restrictive shall apply.
2. Development agreements or specific plans. If a conflict occurs between the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and standards adopted as part of any development agreement or applicable specific plan, the requirements of the development agreement or specific plan shall apply.
3. Private agreements. This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private agreement or restriction (for example, CC&Rs), without affecting the applicability of any agreement or restriction. The City shall not enforce a private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement, or a portion of it.
H. Relationship to prior Zoning Ordinance. The requirements of this Zoning Ordinance supersede all prior zoning ordinances, as amended, of the City of San Ramon. No requirement of this Zoning Ordinance shall validate or legalize a land use or structure that was established, constructed, or maintained in violation of the prior zoning ordinance, as amended, unless it is specifically authorized by this Zoning Ordinance and is in compliance with all other applicable City ordinances and regulations.
I. Application during local emergency. The City Council may authorize deviations from any requirement of this Zoning Ordinance during a local emergency. These deviations shall be authorized by City Council resolution, without notice or public hearing.
J. Other requirements may apply. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the City, or any permit, approval or entitlement required by any other applicable special district or agency, and/or the regulations of any State or Federal agency.
K. Partial invalidation. If any division, article, chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Zoning Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable, that determination shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Council hereby declares that this Zoning Ordinance, and every part thereof, would have been adopted irrespective of the fact that one or more portions of this Zoning Ordinance may be declared invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable.

Chapter II - Zoning Map
Sections:
D1-6 - Purpose
D1-7 - Zoning Map and Zones
D1-6 - Purpose
This Chapter establishes the zones applied to property within the City and adopts the City's Zoning Map.
D1-7 - Zoning Map and Zones
The Council hereby adopts the City of San Ramon Zoning Map (hereafter referred to as the "Zoning Map"), which is on file with the Department and the City Clerk. The Zoning Map is hereby incorporated into this Zoning Ordinance by reference as though it were fully included here.
A. Zones established. The City of San Ramon shall be divided into zones that implement the San Ramon General Plan, as follows.
1. Zoning designation system. The zones established by this Section are shown as symbols on the Zoning Map that consist of letters and numbers, organized as follows.
a. General land use indicator. Each zone symbol includes a letter that indicates the primary purpose of the zone in terms of land use types. For example, "RS" means that the primary land use type is single-family residential, though certain non-residential uses may also be allowed.
b. Residential density or dwelling type indicator. The land use symbol for a particular zone may include a number that identifies a sub-district with a specific range of dwelling unit densities or a type of dwelling. For example, "RS-12" identifies an area within the single-family residential zone where the minimum lot size is 12,000 square feet.
c. Overlay zone indicator. One or more overlay zone indicators may be appended to the primary zone indicator to identify any overlay zones that apply to a site. For example, "RS-12-L" would identify a residentially zoned site that is subject to a "Landmark" designation.
2. Zones. The zones shown in Table 1-1 are hereby established, and shall be shown on the Zoning Map.
B. Interpretation of zone boundaries. If there is uncertainty about the location of any zone boundary shown on the official Zoning Map, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator as follows.
1. A zone boundary shown as approximately following a property line shall be construed to follow the property line.
2. On unsubdivided land, or where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of the boundary shall be determined by using the scale on the Zoning Map, unless dimensions printed on the map indicate the boundary location.
Zoning Map D1
Division D1 - Zoning Ordinance Applicability  Effective March 28, 2018 1-8
3. A zone boundary shown as approximately following the right-of-way line of a freeway, street, railroad, or other identifiable boundary line shall be construed to follow the right-of-way or other boundary line.
4. A zone boundary shown as located within the right-of-way line of a freeway, street, railroad, or other identifiable boundary line shall be construed to follow the centerline of the right-of-way or boundary line.
5. If any uncertainty remains about the location of a zone boundary or other feature shown on the zoning map, the location shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
C. Development on a lot divided by zone boundaries. If a lot is divided by a zone boundary, the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance that apply to each zone shall be applied to the area within each district, and no use other than parking serving a principal use on the site shall be located in a district in which it is not a permitted or conditional use in Division D2 (Allowable Land Uses and Zoning Standards).

Development and Land Use Approval Requirements D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-3
Chapter I - Development and Land Use Approval Requirements
Sections:
D2-1 - Purpose
D2-2 - General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses
D2-3 - Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements
D2-4 - Exemptions from Land Use Permit Requirements
D2-5 - Temporary Uses
D2-1 - Purpose
This Chapter describes the Citys general requirements for the approval of proposed development and new land uses. The permit requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance for specific land uses are in Chapters D2-III through D2-V.
D2-2 - General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses
Each land use and/or structure shall be established, constructed, reconstructed, altered, moved or replaced in compliance with the following requirements.
A. Allowable use. The land use shall be allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the zone applied to the site. The basis for determining whether a use is allowable is described in Section D2-3 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).
B. Permit and approval requirements. Any land use permit or other approval required by Section D2-3 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements) shall be obtained before the issuance of any required grading, building, or other construction permit, and before the proposed use is constructed, otherwise established or put into operation, unless the proposed use is listed in Section D2-4 (Exemptions from Land Use Permit Requirements).
C. Development standards, conditions of approval. Each land use and structure shall comply with the development standards of this Chapter, the provisions of Division D3 (Site Planning and Project Design Standards), and any applicable conditions imposed by a previously granted land use permit.
D. Legal parcel. The site of a proposed development or new land use shall be a parcel that was legally created in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and the Citys Subdivision Ordinance.
D2-3 - Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements
A. Allowable land uses. The uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each zone are listed in Chapters D2-II, D2-III, D2-IV, and D2-V (Tables 2-1, 2-6, 2-8, 2-11, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-15, respectively), together with the type of land use permit required for each use. Each land use listed in Tables 2-1, 2-6, 2-8, 2-11, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-15 is defined in Division D8 (Glossary).
Development and Land Use Approval Requirements D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-4
1. Establishment of an allowable use.
a. Any one or more land uses identified by Tables 2-1, 2-6, 2-8, 2-11, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-15 as being allowable within a specific zone may be established on any parcel within that zone, subject to the land use permit requirements of Subsection B, and compliance with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
b. Where a single parcel is proposed for development with two or more of the land uses listed in the tables, the overall project shall be subject to the highest permit level required by Subsection B. for any individual use. For example, a new building proposed in the OA zone with a bank on the ground floor and professional offices on the second floor would require Minor Use Permit (MUP) approval because Table 2-8 requires Minor Use Permit approval for "banks and financial services," even though an "Office - Professional" is listed in the OA zone as a permitted use, requiring only a Zoning Clearance.
2. Use not listed. A land use that is not listed in Tables 2-1, 2-6, 2-8, 2-11, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-15, and is determined by the Zoning Administrator to not be included in Division D8 (Glossary) under the definition of a listed land use, is not allowed within the City, except as otherwise provided in Subsection A.3, or Section D2-4 (Exemptions from Land Use Permit Requirements).
3. Similar and compatible use may be allowed. The Zoning Administrator may determine that a proposed use not listed in this Division is allowable as follows:
a. Required findings. The Zoning Administrator may determine that a proposed use is similar to and compatible with a listed use and may be allowed, only after first making all of the following findings:
(1) The characteristics of, and activities associated with the use are similar to one or more of the listed uses, and will not involve a greater intensity than the uses listed in the zone;
(2) The use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zone;
(3) The use will be consistent with the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan;
(4) The use will be compatible with the other uses allowed in the zone; and
(5) The use is not listed as allowable in another zone.
A determination that a use qualifies as a similar use and the findings supporting the determination shall be in writing.
b. Applicable standards and permit requirements. When the Zoning Administrator determines that a proposed, but unlisted, use is similar to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply.
c. Referral for determination. The Zoning Administrator may refer the question of whether a proposed use qualifies as a similar and compatible use directly to the Commission for a determination at a public meeting.
d. Appeal. A determination of similar and compatible use may be appealed in compliance with Chapter D7-II (Appeals and Calls for Review).
Development and Land Use Approval Requirements D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-5
B. Permit requirements. Tables 2-1, 2-6, 2-8, 2-11, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-15 within Chapters D2-III, D2-IV, and D2-V provide for land uses that are:
1. Permitted subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. As determined by the Zoning Administrator, a Zoning Clearance may be required prior to operation, (Section D6-30). These are shown as "P" uses in the tables;
2. Allowed subject to the approval of a Minor Use Permit (Section D6-28), and shown as "MUP" uses in the tables;
3. Allowed subject to the approval of a Use Permit (Section D6-28), and shown as "UP" uses in the tables;
4. Allowed subject to the type of City approval required by a specific provision of Chapter D4-III (Standards for Specific Land Uses), and shown as "S" uses in the tables; and
5. Allowed subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, subject first obtaining a Zoning Clearance (Section D6-30). These are shown as ZC uses in the tables;
6. Not allowed in particular zones, and shown as "" in the tables.
Note: A land use authorized through the approval of a Zoning Clearance, Minor Use Permit, or Use Permit may also require Architectural Review (Section D6-22), Preliminary Plan Review (Section D6-26), a Building Permit, or other permit required by the Municipal Code.
D2-4 - Exemptions from Land Use Permit Requirements
The planning permit requirements of this Zoning Ordinance do not apply to the land uses, structures, and activities identified by this Section. These are allowed in all zones subject to compliance with this Section.
A. General requirements for exemption. The land uses, structures, and activities identified by Subsection B below are exempt from the land use permit requirements of this Zoning Ordinance only when:

the extent that additional parking would be required; or (d) change the permitted use of the structure.
4. Repairs and maintenance.
a. Single-family dwellings. Ordinary repairs to, and maintenance of, single-family dwellings, that are also exempt from Architectural Review (Section D6-22).
b. Multi-family, and non-residential structures. Ordinary repairs to, and maintenance of, multi-family residential and non residential structures, if:
(1) The work does not change the approved land use of the site or structure, or add to, enlarge or expand the land use and/or structure;
(2) Any exterior repairs employ the same materials and design as the original construction; and
(3) The work is exempt from Architectural Review (Section D6-22).
5. Small, portable residential accessory structures.

D2-7 - Purposes of the Residential Zones
D2-8 - Residential Zone Land Uses and Permit Requirements
D2-9 - Residential Zone General Development Standards
D2-10 - RC and HR Zone Clustering Requirements
D2-6 - Purpose
This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the residential zones established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
D2-7 - Purposes of the Residential Zones
The purposes of the residential zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. RC (Rural Conservation) zone (0.0 to 0.2 du/ac). The RC zone is applied to areas of the City without urban services, with open space and habitat value, where rural single-family residential development may occur at densities of up to one unit per five gross developable acres. Clustering is encouraged to permit suitable development sites with less than 20 percent slope, where the overall project preserves 90 percent of its site in open space. Minimum lot size for new parcels is at least five acres. The RC zone is consistent with and implements the Rural Conservation land use classification of the General Plan.
B. HR (Hillside Residential) zone (0.0 to 2.0 du/ac). The HR zone is applied to hillside areas of the City appropriate for single-family dwellings, where proposed development requires special standards to ensure resource preservation and limited visual impacts. Single-family residential development may occur at densities of up to two units per acre. Clustering is required to permit suitable development sites on less than 20 percent slope, and to preserve 70 percent of an overall development site in open space. Minimum lot size for new parcels is at least five acres. The HR zone is consistent with and implements the Hillside Residential land use classification of the General Plan.
C. RE (Residential Estate) zone (0.2 to 3.0 du/ac). The RE zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for very low density residential land uses, at densities of 0.2 to 3.0 units per acre, compatible with the topography and public service capacities. The specific allowable density for each parcel is shown on the Zoning Map by a numerical suffix residential density designator (see Section D2-8). Minimum lot size for new parcels ranges from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet. The RE zone is consistent with and implements the Single Family Low Density land use classification of the General Plan.
D. RS (Single-Family Residential) zone (3.0 to 12.0 du/ac). The RS zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for single-family residential land uses in neighborhoods at a density of three to six units per net acre, subject to appropriate standards. The specific allowable density for each parcel is shown on the Zoning Map by a numerical suffix residential density designator (see Section D2-8). Minimum lot size for new parcels ranges from 3,500 to 12,000 square feet. Depending upon the applicable residential density designator, the RS zone is consistent with and implements the Single
Residential Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-8
Family Low Density, Single Family Low-Medium Density, and Single Family Medium Density land use classifications of the General Plan.
E. RM (Medium-Density Residential) zone (6.0 to 14.0 du/ac). The RM zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for multiple residential uses, including duplexes, townhouses, or cluster housing with landscaped open space for residents' use at a density of 6 to 14 units per net acre. Single-family dwellings are also permitted. Minimum lot size for new parcels is 3,500 square feet or larger. The RM zone is consistent with and implements the Multiple Family High Density land use classification of the General Plan.
F. RMH (Medium-High Density Residential) zone (14.0 to 22.0 du/ac). The RMH zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for townhouses or apartments at a density of 14 to 22 units per net acre. Minimum lot size for new multifamily parcels is 10,000 square feet or larger. Single-family dwellings are also permitted with a minimum lot size for new parcels of 2,000 square feet with a maximum of 3,100 based on the per acre RMH density range. The RMH zone is consistent with and implements the Multiple Family High Density land use classification of the General Plan.
G. RH (High-Density Residential) zone (22.0 to 30.0 du/ac). The RH zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for compact, high density, well-designed residential development, including apartments and town houses with a density range of 22 to 30 units per net acre. Proposed development will reflect high quality design with integrated open space and recreational and/or cultural amenities, as well as providing workforce housing, structured parking, and units of various number of bedrooms, with specific attention to three and more bedroom units to achieve the overall goal of providing diverse types of dwelling units. Minimum lot size for new parcels is 10,000 square feet or larger. The RH zone is consistent with and implements the Multiple Family Very High Density land use classification of the General Plan.
H. RVH (Multiple Family-Very High Density) zone (30.0 to 50.0 du/ac). The RVH zone is applied to areas appropriate for the highest density multiple-family residential development within the City, at densities between 30 and 50 units per net acre. Proposed development will reflect high quality design with integrated open space and recreational and/or cultural amenities, as well as providing workforce housing, structured parking, and units of various number of bedrooms, with specific attention to three and more bedroom units to achieve the overall goal of providing diverse types of dwelling units. Minimum lot size for new parcels is 10,000 square feet or larger. The RVH zone is consistent with and implements the Multiple Family Very High Density land use classification of the General Plan.
D2-8 - Residential Zone Land Uses and Permit Requirements
A. Applicability. Table 2-1 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each residential zone, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section D2-3 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).
Note: Where the last column in the table ("Specific Use Regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply.
B. Additional City review requirements. A land use that is authorized by the planning permit required by Table 2-1 may also require Architectural Review (Section D6-22), and/or Preliminary Plan Review (Section D6-26).
C. Temporary uses. Section D6-27 (Temporary Use Permits) establishes permit requirements and standards for all allowable temporary uses.

D2-10 - RC and HR Zone Clustering Requirements
A. Applicability. Residential development including four or more units should be clustered within the RC zone, and shall be clustered within the HR zone, in compliance with this Section.
B. Cluster development design standards. The design of a proposed cluster development shall comply with the following standards.
1. Minimum lot area. Each clustered lot shall be a minimum of 20,000 square feet.
2. Maximum cluster size. No more than 10 dwelling units shall be within a single cluster.
3. Setback and buffer requirements. Proposed structures shall be located on each parcel with minimum setbacks of 30 feet in the front, 20 feet on each side, and 35 feet in the rear. A residential cluster shall be separated from each other cluster and any roadway abutting the site by a minimum of 100 feet.
C. Open space preservation.
1. RC zone. Clustering is encouraged to permit suitable development sites with less than 20 percent slope, and so that the overall project will preserve 90 percent of its site as open space.
2. HR zone. Clustering is required to permit suitable development sites with less than 20 percent slope. The overall project shall preserve 70 percent of its site as open space.
3. Preservation requirements. The open space on the site that is preserved by clustering shall be retained as part of an unsubdivided open space parcel or in individual open space parcels, and shall not be eligible for future development; provided that open space parcels may include conservation open space, community recreation open space, public access opens space, or buffer open space.

This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the Mixed Use zones established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
D2-12 - Purposes of Mixed Use Zones
The purposes of the individual Mixed Use zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. MU (Mixed Use) zone. The MU zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for an integrated mix of non-residential uses, including retail, services, and offices, together with residential uses at intensities of up to 0.70 FAR. Development should reflect high quality design with integrated open space and recreational and/or cultural amenities, and opportunities for affordable housing. Structured parking may be required. Additional FAR, up to a maximum of 1.00, may be allowed for projects that provide more than the required 25 percent of total units for workforce housing and significant public benefit. The MU zone is consistent with and implements the Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
B. CCMU (City Center Mixed Use) zone. The CCMU zone is applied to the City Center properties in compliance with the General Plan to develop the City Center into a cultural, recreational, and compatible retail center that provides for a cohesive mix of civic, retail, office, and open space uses. Development intensities of up to 0.70 FAR will be permitted. Additional FAR, up to a maximum of 1.35, may be allowed for projects that include such elements as affordable housing and significant public benefits and/or amenities such as public art and plazas, public facilities, and/or a transit facility nearby or in close proximity to the CCMU Zone. Development should reflect high quality design, with integrated open space and recreational and/or cultural amenities, as well as opportunities for workforce housing. Structured parking may be required. The CCMU Zone is consistent with and implements the Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.

D2-15 - Mixed Use Zone Additional Development Standards
A. Daylight plane requirement. A proposed structure shall not intercept a 30-degree daylight plane inclined inward at a residential zone property line and/or I-680 freeway property line. The 30-degree daylight plane shall be measured from:
1. A height of 6 to 8 feet above existing grade, as required by section D3-4.F, at the R zone property line and/or I-680 freeway property line for a site in a MU zone; and
2. A height of 12 feet above existing grade at the R zone boundary line and/or I-680 freeway property line for a site in the CCMU zone.
The 30-degree daylight plane shall be measured from the required height above the existing site grade regardless of the site grade on either side of the property line.
B. Mixed use project development standards. A mixed use project shall comply with the following requirements. A mixed use project combines a mix of nonresidential and residential uses on the same site. The residential units of mixed use projects are typically located above the nonresidential uses (vertical mixed use), but horizontal mixed use may be allowed which provides residential at ground level behind street-fronting nonresidential uses.
1. Design considerations. A mixed use project shall be designed to achieve the following objectives.
a. The design shall provide for internal compatibility between the residential and non-residential uses on the site.
b. Potential glare, noise, odors, traffic, and other potentially significant impacts on residents shall be minimized to allow a compatible mix of residential and nonresidential uses on the same site.
c. The design shall take into consideration potential impacts on adjacent properties and shall include specific design features to minimize potential impacts.
d. The design shall ensure that the residential units are of a residential character, and that appropriate privacy between residential units and other uses on the site is provided.
e. Site planning and building design shall provide for convenient and attractive pedestrian access from the public street into the nonresidential portions of the project, through such means as courtyards, plazas, walkways, and street furniture.
f. Site planning and building design shall be compatible with and enhance the adjacent and surrounding land uses in terms of building design, color, exterior materials, landscaping, lighting, roof styles, scale, and signage.
2. Mix of uses. A mixed use project may combine residential uses with any other use allowed in the MU or CCMU zone; provided that where a mixed use project is proposed with a use that is required to have Use Permit approval, the entire mixed use project shall be subject to that permit requirement.
3. Site layout and project design standards. Each mixed use project shall comply with the property development standards of the applicable zone, and the following requirements.
Figure 2-2 - Daylight Plane Requirement
Mixed Use Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-28
a. Location of residential units. The location of residential units shall comply with the standards prescribed in this Section.
b. Parking. To encourage the development of both residential and nonresidential uses in mixed use zones, the use of shared parking provisions shall be incorporated into mixed use projects.
c. Loading areas. Nonresidential loading areas shall be located away from residential units and shall be screened from view from the residential portion of the project to the maximum extent feasible.
d. Refuse and recycling areas. Areas for the collection and storage of refuse and recyclable materials shall be located on the site in locations that are convenient for both the residential and nonresidential uses.
4. Performance standards.
a. Lighting. Lighting for nonresidential uses shall be appropriately shielded to limit impacts on the residential units.
b. Noise. Each residential unit shall be designed and constructed to minimize adverse impacts from nonresidential project noise, in compliance with the City's Noise Ordinance.
c. Hours of operation. A mixed use project proposing a nonresidential component located below or in front of a residential component that will operate outside of the hours from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., shall require Use Permit approval to ensure that the commercial uses will not negatively impact the residential uses within the project, or any adjacent residential uses.

D2-24 - Special Purpose Zone Land Uses and Permit Requirements
D2-25 - Special Purpose Zone General Development Standards
D2-26 - Special Purpose Zone Land Use Limitations and Additional Development Standards
D2-22 - Purpose
This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the special purpose zones established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
D2-23 - Purposes of Special Purpose Zones
The purposes of the Special Purpose zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. AG (Agriculture) zone. The AG zone is applied to areas of the City appropriate for large-scale agricultural operations and related open-space uses, where non-agricultural uses are limited to those incidental to agricultural operations and to mining activities, and where residential development is permitted only at very low density, compatible with low-intensity agriculture and keeping of livestock. Building intensity may be up to 0.10 FAR, and residential density is limited to one dwelling unit per 20 acres. The AG zone is consistent with and implements the Open Space land use classification of the General Plan.
B. OS-1 (Open Space) zone. The OS-1 zone is applied to areas of the City with large public or private sites of at least two contiguous acres, to be permanently designated for open-space use to maintain their natural unaltered state. The OS zone is consistent with and implements the Open Space land use classification of the General Plan.
C. OS-2 (Open Space) zone. The OS-2 zone is applied to areas of the City where privately owned land is suitable for passive recreational and limited agricultural purposes, and/or where lands subject to flooding, landslide, or other hazards should remain in open space. Building intensity may be up to 0.10 FAR, and residential density is limited to one dwelling unit per 20 acres. The OS zone is consistent with and implements the Open Space land use classification of the General Plan.
D. P (Parks and Recreation) zone. The P zone is applied to areas of the City with public and private recreation sites and facilities. Building intensity may be up to 0.10 FAR. The P zone is consistent with and implements the Parks land use classification of the General Plan.
E. GC (Golf Course) zone. The GC zone is applied to sites developed and used as golf courses, for the purpose of maintaining each site in golf course use, including closely related and supporting uses as allowed by Table 2-12. The GC zone implements and is consistent with the Golf Course designation of the General Plan.
F. PS (Public and Semi-Public) zone. The PS zone is applied to areas of the City with schools, hospitals and related medical offices, public and private meeting facilities, utilities, and quasi-public uses. Building intensity may be up to 0.35 FAR. The PS zone is consistent with and implements the Public and Semipublic land use classification of the General Plan.
Special Purpose Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-42
G. M-1 (Medical Center) zone. The M-1 zone is applied to sites within the City of at least two acres, that are appropriate for clustered medical facilities that include an acute care hospital licensed in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 1520 et seq., other inpatient medical care facilities, doctor's offices, and related services. Building intensity may be up to 0.35 FAR. The M-1 zone is consistent with and implements the Public and Semipublic land use classification of the General Plan.
H. M-2 (Health Facility) zone. The M-2 zone is applied to sites within the City of at least two acres, that are appropriate for facilities for outpatient medical services, excluding an acute care hospital as defined by the Health and Safety Code. Building intensity may be up to 0.35 FAR. The M-1 zone is consistent with and implements the Public and Semipublic land use classification of the General Plan.
I. PD (Planned Development) zone. The PD zone is applied to large parcels of land in order to reduce or eliminate the rigidity, delays, and conflicts that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels, and to:
1. Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in quality urban design;
2. Encourage variety and avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and amenity;
3. Provide a mechanism whereby the City may authorize desirable developments consistent with the General Plan without inviting speculative rezoning applications, which, if granted, often could deprive other owners of development opportunities without resulting in construction of the proposed facilities;
4. Encourage allocation and improvement of common open space in residential areas, and provide for open space maintenance at the expense of those who will directly benefit from it; and
5. Encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods.
Building intensity may be up to the maximum required by the General Plan land use classification applicable to the site. The PD zone is consistent with and implements all land use classifications of the General Plan.
D2-24 - Special Purpose Zone Land Uses and Permit Requirements
A. AG, OS-1, OS-2, P, GC, PS, M-1, and M-2 zones. Tables 2-11 and 2-12 identify the uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the Special Purpose zones, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section D2-3 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).
Note: Where the last column in the table ("Specific Use Regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply.
B. PD zone. Any permitted or conditional use allowed by this Zoning Ordinance may be authorized on a site in the PD zone through the approval of a Planned Development Permit in compliance with Section D6-25 (Planned Development Permits), or a Specific Plan, consistent with the General Plan land use designations applicable to the site.

D2-25 - Special Purpose Zone General Development Standards
A. AG, OS-1, OS-2, P, and PS zones. Subdivisions, new land uses and structures, and alterations to existing land uses and structures, shall be designed, constructed, and/or established in compliance with the requirements specified by the Use Permit required for the project by Tables 2-11 and 2-12; except that if the Use Permit does not regulate a development feature that is regulated by an abutting primary zone, or if a Use Permit is not required, the regulations of the abutting primary zone shall apply to each adjacent portion of an AG, OS-1, OS-2, P, or PS zone, as applicable. The applicable development standards (e.g., landscaping, parking and loading, etc.) in Division D3 of this Zoning Ordinance shall also apply to proposed development and new land uses in the AG, OS-1, OS-2, P, or PS zones.
B. GC zone development standards. Subdivisions, new land uses and structures, and alterations to existing land uses and structures shall be designed, constructed, and/or established in compliance with the requirements specified by the Use Permit required for the project by Table 2-12, except as identified in Subsections B.1 and B.2, below. The applicable development standards (e.g., landscaping, parking, signs, etc.) in Division D3 of this Zoning Ordinance shall also apply to development and new land uses proposed in the GC zone.
1. Height limit. No structure shall exceed a height of one story or 24 feet.
2. Floor area ratio. The maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR) for all structures on the project site shall not exceed 0.10.
C. PD zone development standards.
1. Minimum site area. The minimum net area of a PD zone shall be 10 acres, provided that a PD zone may be subdivided in compliance with an approved Planned Development Permit or Specific Plan. A site that does not meet the minimum acreage or lot width requirement may be developed, provided that the development proposal includes adjoining parcels which collectively meet the minimum development standards. It is not necessary for the collective properties to be under the same control and/or ownership. The review authority may reduce the 10 acre requirement where it determines that the proposed project will provide substantial public benefit.
2. Residential density. Except where a density bonus is granted in compliance with the City's density bonus regulations, the total number of dwelling units in a PD zone shall not exceed the maximum number permitted by the General Plan density for the total area of parcels designated for residential use and for open space excluding area devoted to public and private streets, areas with a slope of 20 percent or more, areas with a maximum elevation of 40 feet and areas with a minimum contiguous area of three acres.
3. Other development regulations. Other development regulations shall be as prescribed by the PD Plan, provided that the minimum setback requirements for front, corner-side, side and rear yards may not be reduced by more than 20 percent from those of the base zone that would otherwise apply.
4. Mixed use component. Each PD development proposal shall consider a mixed use development strategy. This strategy should include a horizontal and/or vertical integration of project types (i.e., residential adjacent to commercial/office or residential above commercial). If this approach is determined to be infeasible by the applicant it shall be the obligation of the applicant to substantiate this before the Commission.

Any perceived conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and any other provision of this Zoning Ordinance shall be resolved in compliance with Section D1-5 (Rules of Interpretation).
A. Mapping of overlay zones. The applicability of any overlay zone to a specific site is shown by the overlay zone Zoning Map symbol established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones), being appended as a suffix to the symbol for the primary zone on the Zoning Map.
B. Application of overlay zones to property. The overlay zones are applied to property through the rezoning process in compliance with Chapter D7-III (Amendments), subject to any specific rezoning requirements of the applicable overlay zone. The rezoning of property to apply an overlay zone may be initiated by either the City or the property owner, except where initiation is otherwise restricted by this Chapter for a specific overlay zone.
C. Allowed land uses, permit requirements, development standards. Except as may be otherwise provided by this Chapter for a specific overlay zone:
1. Any land use normally allowed in the primary zone by this Chapter may be allowed within an overlay zone, subject to any additional requirements of the overlay zone;

3. Development and new land uses within an overlay zone shall comply with all applicable development standards of the primary zone, except as modified by this Chapter.
Overlay Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-52
D2-29 - Height Limit (-H) Overlay Zone
A. Purpose. The Height Limit (-H) overlay zone is intended to control the location of structures which exceed the height limits of a primary zone, and to ensure that the appearance and effects of commercial and office buildings are harmonious with the character of their surroundings, and to minimize the impact of commercial and office development on adjacent Residential Zones.
B. Applicability. The -H overlay zone shall be applied to each parcel in the OA zone that has an existing and/or approved but unbuilt structure that exceeds 55 feet in height, and to each parcel in a commercial zone with an existing and/or approved structure that exceeds 50 feet in height as of the effective date of the ordinance establishing this overlay zone.
C. Development regulations. Proposed development and new land uses within the -H overlay shall comply with the development regulations of the applicable primary zone, except as follows.
1. A major department store within a retail center of a regional context providing a minimum 400,000 gross square feet of retail shall be allowed a maximum height of up to 70 feet.
2. An office building may be allowed a maximum height of up to 75 feet provided that building architecture incorporates a varying roof plane to add variation in the structures' appearance.
3. An existing structure with a height in excess of 55 feet, shall not be permitted to increase its height except through the approval of a Variance in compliance with Section D6-29.
4. Each approved but unbuilt structure with an entitlement and/or development agreement to build at a height over 55 feet, shall be built only to the maximum height permitted by the conditions of approval of its entitlement and/or development agreement.
D2-30 - Interim Study (-IS) Overlay Zone
A. Purpose. The Interim Study (-IS) overlay zone is intended to allow discretionary review of development proposals in areas where changes in the General Plan or zoning regulations are contemplated or under study.
B. Applicability. The -IS overlay may be combined with any primary zone established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones).
C. Application to property.
1. Prior to approving an amendment reclassifying land to an -IS zone, the Commission and Council shall approve a study plan that identifies regulatory problems and identifies the land use and development issues to be resolved for the area proposed for rezoning to the -IS overlay zone.
2. An ordinance applying the -IS overlay shall contain a provision terminating the -IS designation two years from its effective date. An ordinance establishing an -IS zone may be amended, reenacted, or superseded by a zoning map amendment adopted in compliance with Chapter D7-III (Amendments).
D. Permit requirements. Use Permit approval shall be required for establishment of any new or expanded use allowed in the primary zone. A Use Permit application that has been denied, or approved subject to conditions unacceptable to the applicant, may be resubmitted on or after the effective date of a zoning map and/or text amendment that supersedes an -IS overlay zone designation.
Overlay Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-53
E. Required findings. In addition to the findings required for Use Permit approval by Section D6-28 (Use Permits and Minor Use Permits), and any additional findings that may be required by the study plan required by Subsection C. for a specific use type, Use Permit approval shall require a finding that the proposed use will not conflict with the land use and development policies established for the area at the time the -IS zone was adopted.
F. Development regulations. Proposed development and new land uses shall comply with the development regulations of the primary zone in addition to any requirements imposed through Use Permit conditions of approval.
D2-31 - Landmark (-L) Overlay Zone
A. Purpose. The Landmark (-L) overlay zone is intended to implement the General Plan by:
1. Preventing the demolition, destruction, alteration, misuse, or neglect of historic or architecturally significant buildings that form an important link to San Ramon's past.
2. Promote the conservation, preservation, protection, and enhancement of each landmark district.
3. Stimulate the economic health and visual quality of the community and stabilize and enhance the value of property.
4. Encourage development tailored to the character and significance of each landmark district through a Conservation Plan that includes goals, objectives, and design guidelines and development criteria.
5. Provide a mechanism to resolve conflicts in an orderly fashion between goals of landmark preservation and alternative land uses.
B. Applicability.
1. Primary zones. The -L overlay zone may be combined with any zone established by Section D1-7 (Zoning Map and Zones).
2. Exempt projects. The requirements of this Section shall not apply to a project initiated prior to the effective date of an ordinance establishing an -L overlay zone or designating a landmark.
a. The project shall be considered a nonconforming use, subject to Chapter D7-I (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels).

Overlay Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-54
D. Procedure for designating property. An area of the community, a site, and/or a structure may be designated with the -L overlay zone in compliance with the following requirements.
1. Eligibility for designation. An area within the City may be designated with the -L overlay as a landmark district, and/or a site or individual structure may be designated with the -L overlay as a landmark, if one or more of the following criteria are met, as rigorously applied and supported by findings of historical or architectural significance.
a. The area possesses character, interest, or value as part of the heritage of the City;
b. The area is the location of a significant historical event;
c. The area is identified with a person or group that contributed significantly to the culture and development of the City;
d. Structures within the area exemplify a particular architectural style or way of life important to the City, or are the best remaining examples of an architectural style in a neighborhood;
e. The area or its structures are identified as the work of a person or group whose work has influenced the heritage of the City, the state or the United States; and/or
f. The area has potential for yielding information of archaeological interest.
Portions of an area within the City that do not meet the above criteria may be included within an -L overlay zone if inclusion is found to be essential to the integrity of the district.
2. Landmark conservation plan required. Prior to filing an application for rezoning to apply the -L overlay, the applicant shall prepare a Landmark District Conservation Plan with the assistance of the Department. Each Landmark Conservation Plan shall contain:
a. A map and description of the proposed district, including boundaries; the age, setting, and character of structures; urban design elements and streetscapes; major public improvements; and proposed objectives to be achieved;
b. A statement of the architectural or historical significance of the proposed district;
c. A list of specific alterations that should be subject to Architectural Review in order to protect the architectural or historical character of the proposed district;
d. A set of specific development guidelines for new construction and alterations necessary to preserve the character of the proposed district; and
e. Proposed rules and regulations for Architectural Review.
3. Application requirements.
a. Eligibility for filing. An application for rezoning to apply an -L overlay zone or landmark designation may be initiated by the Commission, Council, or the property owner.
b. Application contents. The application shall include a proposed Landmark Conservation Plan for the district in compliance with Subsection D.2, and the following information:
(1) A map showing the location of the building or structure and building plans or photographs of the building exterior;
(2) A statement of the architectural or historical significance of the proposed building and description of the particular features that should be preserved; and
Overlay Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-55
(3) The consent of the owner or authorized agent to the proposed designation. For purposes of this Section, each condominium owners' association shall be deemed the property owner of common areas.
Prior to accepting the application as complete, the Zoning Administrator may request additional information, plans or materials deemed necessary to support the application.
4. Review and approval.
a. Preliminary review, neighborhood workshop. The Commission shall consider the proposed designation and make a preliminary determination based on any documentation that the Commission may require.
(1) If the Commission determines that the process of designating the property should proceed, it shall conduct a neighborhood workshop in the proposed district to explain the proposal and the amendment process to neighborhood residents.
(2) Notice of the workshop shall be given in compliance with Chapter D7-IV (Public Hearings). After the workshop, the Commission shall decide whether to proceed with the -L designation.
b. Public hearing. If the Commission determines that an -L designation may be appropriate and complies with the criteria in Subsection D.1, the proposed district shall be the subject of public hearings before the Commission and the Council. The hearings shall be set, noticed, and conducted in compliance with Chapter D7-IV.
In addition to the information required in a public hearing notice by Chapter D7-IV, notice of a public hearing to establish an -L district or designation of a landmark shall include a statement that original petitioners have the right to withdraw their support of the district at any time prior to the hearing, and that property owners who have not signed the petition have the right to do so prior to the date of the hearing.
c. Required findings. In addition to the findings for the approval of a rezoning by Chapter D7-III (Amendments), a rezoning to apply the -L designation shall require that the Commission and Council shall also first find that the proposed district or historical site has a significant architectural or historical character that can be preserved and enhanced through appropriate controls on new development and alterations to existing buildings and landscaping.
d. Adoption of Landmark Conservation Plan. An ordinance establishing an -L district shall include a Landmark District Conservation Plan, in the form submitted or as revised by the Commission or Council.
(1) The development guidelines included within the plan may modify the land use and development regulations of the primary zone, but shall not significantly alter the regulations.
(2) A guideline shall be found to be a significant alteration of primary zone regulations if it substantially prevents property from being used in compliance with the provisions of the primary zone, or creates a substantial number of nonconforming uses or structures.
e. Amendment of Landmark Conservation Plan. An adopted Landmark Conservation Plan shall be amended only in compliance with Chapter D7-III (Amendments).
Overlay Zones D2
Division D2  Allowable Land Uses and Zone Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 2-56
E. Land use and development regulations. Proposed development and new land uses within an -L overlay zone shall comply with all applicable requirements of the primary zone, except:
1. Where modified by another overlay zone;
2. Where the Commission grants an exception to the land use regulations of the primary zone through Use Permit approval, where the Commission first determines that the exception is necessary to permit the preservation or restoration of a historic or architecturally significant building, structure or site; or
3. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of the primary zone or another overlay zone and the -L zone Landmark Conservation Plan, the requirements of the -L zone Landmark Conservation Plan shall control.
F. Demolition and Design Review procedures.
1. Review authority. Except as modified by an adopted Landmark Conservation Plan, Design Review in an -L zone, or of a proposed alteration, enlargement or demolition of a designated historical site shall be conducted in compliance with Chapter D6-II (Permit Review and Decisions), provided that Design Review shall be the responsibility of the Commission.
2. Permit issuance. Commission approval shall be required in compliance with this Subsection prior to the issuance by the Chief Building Inspector of a permit for the construction, alteration, enlargement, or demolition of a building or structure located in an -L zone, or of a designated historical site.
3. Design Review criteria.
a. In addition to the requirements for Architectural Review in Chapter D6-II the Commission shall consider the proposed demolition, new construction, or alteration in the context of the adopted Landmark Conservation Plan and the architectural or historical value and significance of the site and structure in relation to the Overlay Zone.
b. Commission considerations shall include the visual relationship of proposed architectural design elements to the surrounding area, including scale, height, rhythm of spacing, pattern of windows and doorways, building siting and relationship to landscaping, roof pitch, architectural style, and structural details, materials, colors, and textures.
4. Demolition requirements. If, after review of demolition permit application, the Commission determines that the structure has historical, architectural or cultural interest or value, the Commission may withhold approval for demolition for 180 calendar days from the date of Commission action, or until environmental review is completed, whichever occurs later.
a. During the 180 days, the Commission may direct the Department to consult with recognized historic preservation organizations and other civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens, make recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies, explore the possibility of moving one or more structures or other features, and take any other reasonable measures.
b.

E. In-lieu fee. When a project does not qualify for one of the exemptions listed in Subsection D., above, and the Commission has granted relief from undergrounding in conjunction with a request for construction in compliance with Subsection F., below, an in-lieu fee may be established based
on front footage costs estimated by the utility company serving the subject site. The City Engineer
shall collect the in-lieu fees and manage and adjust the fees for inflation as deemed necessary.
F. Hardship waiver - In-lieu fees. If the cost of placing utility services underground is so great as to constitute an unreasonable hardship, the property owner subject to the undergrounding requirement may apply in writing to the Commission for relief from the provisions of this Section. The request shall include a detailed description of the overhead utility services proposed to be placed
underground and separate itemized cost estimates of construction of the project if the utilities were placed or relocated underground or above ground.
1. Unreasonable hardship findings. After considering the request for relief, the Commission
may grant relief as may be deemed proper under the circumstances, including in-lieu fees or the indefinite deferral of the undergrounding requirement. The Commission may grant this relief only if all of the following findings can first be made:
a. The cost of placing existing utilities underground is either so exorbitant or disproportionate to the total cost of construction as to constitute an unreasonable
hardship in compliance with Subparagraph F.1.d., below;
b. No new utility poles are to be erected;
c. There is another overhead utility service in the immediate vicinity which would remain
even if no waiver is granted;
d. The cost of undergrounding exceeds 20 percent of the project valuation as determined by the currently adopted valuation tables of the Citys Building Official; and

For residential developments the plan shall cover areas of the site visible from public streets;
for other development, the plan shall cover all areas of the site required to be landscaped by Section D3-19 (Landscape Location Requirements), below.
No Building Permit shall be issued and no construction activity shall commence on the site until the Zoning Administrator has verified that the Landscape Plan submitted with the Building Permit application is as approved.
B. Content. A Landscape Plan shall contain all of the information identified in the Department handout for preparing Landscape Plans, and required by Municipal Code section C4-122 and the California State Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (MWELO), Sections 490  495, Chapter 2.7, Division 2, Title 23 in the California Code of Regulations. C. Statement of surety. Landscaping is the final phase of a project, and the one most often
underdeveloped. To insure completion, the Zoning Administrator may require that a statement of surety in the form of cash, performance bond, letter of credit, or certificate of deposit shall be posted
with the City, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the total value, or another amount determined by the Zoning Administrator, of all plant materials, installation, irrigation, and maintenance, for a twoyear period. The cost of materials shall be provided by the Registered Landscape Architect responsible for the project. The Zoning Administrator may require statements of surety for phased projects, a legitimate delay in landscape installation due to seasonal requirements (including adverse weather conditions) and similar circumstances where it may not be advisable or desirable
to install all of a project's landscaping before occupancy of the site.
D. Minor changes to approved plans. Landscape Plan approval may include the Zoning Administrator authorizing minor changes from the requirements of this Chapter.

except where landscaping would adversely affect existing drainage or erosion control plans, or it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that landscaping is not necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Chapter.
B. Parking areas. Parking areas shall be landscaped in compliance with the following requirements. Parking lot landscaping, may be counted toward fulfilling the landscape area requirements identified in Section D3-20 below
1. Landscape materials. Landscape materials shall be evenly-distributed throughout the
parking lot using a combination of trees, shrubs, ground cover, mulch, gravel, and other xeriscape areas as approved by the review authority. At the time of planting, the size of the
shrubs and trees shall be in compliance with D3-21(B).
2. Curbing. Areas containing plant materials should be bordered by a concrete curb at least six inches high and six inches wide. Alternative barrier design to protect landscaped areas from damage by vehicles and/or to filter/retain runoff on site may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
3. Runoff. Parking lot landscaped areas shall be designed to filter/retain runoff on site.
4. Location of landscaping. To the extent possible, parking lot landscaping should be located
so that pedestrians are not required to cross landscaped areas to reach structure entrances from parked cars. This should be achieved through proper orientation of the landscaped
fingers and islands. If parking lot landscaping must be located in a manner that requires pedestrian access across landscaped areas, pedestrian access shall be accommodated.
5. Bumper overhang areas. To increase the parking lot landscaped area, a maximum of two feet of the parking stall depth may be landscaped with low-growth, hearty materials in lieu of paving, allowing a two-foot bumper overhang while maintaining the required parking
dimensions.
6. Parking lot perimeter landscaping. Parking area perimeters shall be landscaped as follows. The Zoning Administrator may adjust the tree spacing requirements of this Subsection based upon the growth characteristics and proper maintenance practices for the
species of trees proposed.
a. Location and size of landscape areas.
(1) Adjacent to streets. Parking areas for nonresidential uses adjoining a public street shall be designed to provide a 10-foot landscaped planting strip between
the street right-of-way and parking area. Parking areas for residential uses shall not be located within the required setback areas and the minimum width of the landscape planting strip shall be equal to the required setbacks.
(2) Screening plant materials. The landscaping shall be designed and maintained to screen cars from view from the street and shall be a height of between 30 and 36 inches. Screening materials may include a combination of plant materials, earth berms, solid masonry walls, raised planters, or other screening devices to
meet the intent of this requirement; however, screening materials may not use only solid masonry walls without plant cover.

A. Intent. The requirements of this Chapter are intended to ensure that sufficient off-street parking is
provided for all uses and structures, and that parking facilities are attractive, properly designed, and
located to be unobtrusive, generally to the rear of the site, while meeting the needs of the specific use or structure.
B. Purpose. More specifically, the purposes of the off-street parking and loading provisions are to:
1. Ensure that off-street parking and loading facilities are provided for new land uses and for major alterations and enlargements of existing uses in direct proportion to the need for the facilities created by each use;
2. Establish parking standards for residential and commercial uses consistent with need and with the feasibility of providing parking on specific sites; and
3. Ensure that off-street parking and loading facilities are designed in a manner that will ensure
efficiency, protect the public safety, and, where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from adverse impacts.
Parking and Loading D3
Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-34
D3-26 - Applicability and Basic Requirements
A. Applicability. Each land use and structure, including a change or expansion of a land use or structure shall be provided continuously maintained off-street parking and loading areas in
compliance with this Chapter. A land use shall not be commenced and a structure shall not be
occupied until the improvements required by this Chapter are satisfactorily completed.
B. When required.
1. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided in compliance with this Chapter at
the time of initial occupancy of a site, construction of a structure, or major alteration or enlargement of a site or structure.
2. For the purposes of these requirements, "major alteration or enlargement" shall mean a
change of use or an addition that would increase the number of parking or loading spaces required by 10 percent or more of the total number required before the alteration or enlargement.
C. Joint use. Off-street parking and loading facilities required by this Chapter for a use shall not be considered as providing parking or loading spaces for any other use, except in compliance with
Section D3-30 (Reduction of Parking Requirements). D. Nonconforming parking or loading. No existing use of land or structure shall be deemed to be
nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking or loading facilities required by this Chapter; provided, the facilities being used for off-street parking and loading as of the date of adoption of this Chapter shall not be reduced in number to less than that required by this Chapter.
See Section D3-28.D (Number of Parking Spaces Required  Nonconforming parking) regarding changes to structures with nonconforming parking.
E. Location and ownership.
1. Residential uses. Parking required to serve a residential use shall be on the same site as the use served.
2. Nonresidential uses. Parking required to serve a nonresidential use may be on the same or a different site under the same or different ownership as the use served; provided, the parking
shall be within the following maximum distances of the use served, measured from the
nearest corner of the parking facility to the main public entrance of the use served via the shortest pedestrian route, as shown in Table 3-7 (Maximum Distances for Off-Site Parking for Nonresidential uses), below.

Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-35
F. Life of facility.
1. Facilities for off-site parking shall be restricted to that use by a recorded agreement, deed, or lease for a minimum period of 10 years from the date a permit or approval requiring the parking is first issued.
2. The Zoning Administrator may waive this restriction upon first finding that substitute parking facilities meeting the requirements of this Chapter are provided.
3. No use shall be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
G. Computation of spaces required rounding off of spaces. If, in the application of the requirements of this Chapter, a fractional number is obtained, one parking or loading space shall be required for a fraction of more than one-half, and no space shall be required for a fraction of onehalf or less.
H. Land banking. Upon a determination of the Zoning Administrator, a portion of the required parking improvements may be deferred if it is first found that all of the spaces are not needed immediately and that a Minor Use Permit could be granted in compliance with Section D6.28 (Use Permits and
Minor Use Permits).
D3-27 - General Parking Regulations
A. Timing of installation. A new or altered structure shall not be occupied, and a new land use not requiring a structure shall not be established, until all off-street parking and loading facilities required by this Chapter are in place and approved by the City.
B. Parking and loading spaces to be permanent. Each parking and loading space shall be
permanently available, marked, and maintained for parking or loading purposes for the use it is intended to serve. The approval of a Temporary Use Permit (Section D6.27) may allow the
temporary use of a parking or loading space for other purposes.
C. Parking and loading to be unrestricted. An owner, lessee, tenant, or other person having control of the operation of premises for which parking or loading spaces are required by this Chapter shall not prevent, prohibit, or restrict authorized persons from using the spaces without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator.
D3-28 - Number of Parking Spaces Required
Each land use shall be provided the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Section. See
Section D3-38 for off-street parking requirements for bicycles and motorcycles.
A. Parking requirements by land use. Each land use shall provide the number of off-street parking
spaces required by Table 3-8, except where more spaces are required through discretionary permit review, or where a reduction of parking is granted in compliance with Section D3-30 (Reduction of Parking Requirements).
1. Use of site not identified. Where the land use that will occupy a proposed development is
not identified at the time of permit application, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the
probable use and the number of parking and loading spaces required. In order to make this determination, the Zoning Administrator may require the submittal of data from the applicant or collected at the applicant's expense.
Parking and Loading D3
Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-36
2. Floor area. Where Table 3-8 establishes a parking requirement based on floor area in
square feet (e.g., 1 space for each 1,000 sf of floor area), the floor area shall be construed to
mean gross interior floor area unless otherwise specified, and shall include all locations of shared halls, lobby areas, and rest rooms, but shall not include areas for vertical circulation, elevators, or stairs.
3. Accessory uses. A single use with accessory components shall provide parking for primary use, and each component. For example, a hotel with a meeting room shall provide the parking spaces required by Table 3-8 for a hotel (e.g., the guest rooms), and for a meeting
room.
4. Spaces required for alteration or enlargement. The number of parking or loading spaces
required for an alteration or enlargement of an existing use or structure, or for a change of occupancy, shall be in addition to the number of spaces existing before the alteration, enlargement, or change of occupancy unless the more spaces exist than the total required by this Chapter. In this case, the number of spaces in excess of the minimum shall be counted in determining the required number of spaces.
5. Multi-tenant sites. A site with multiple tenants shall provide the aggregate number of parking spaces required for each separate use; except that where the site is developed as an integrated center with shared parking and no spaces reserved for a particular use, parking
shall be provided as required by Table 3-8 for a retail complex. When a multi-tenant center includes one or more uses that will need more parking than retail uses (for example, a fitness center, office uses, or theater) additional parking shall be required for the non-retail use
unless a parking reduction is approved in compliance with D3-30 (Reduction of Parking
Requirements).
B. Excessive parking. The City discourages a land use being provided more off-street parking spaces than required by this Chapter, to avoid the inefficient use of land, unnecessary pavement, and excessive storm water runoff from paved surfaces.
1. The provision of off-street parking spaces in excess of the requirements in Table 3-8 is
allowed and may be compact sized spaces measuring 8.5 feet by 18 feet, but only up to a
maximum of 10 percent, and only when additional landscaping and pedestrian amenities are also provided to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator. 2. The provision of off-street parking spaces in excess of the requirements in Table 3-8 is
allowed and may be compact sized spaces measuring 8.5 feet by 18 feet, but only up to a
maximum of 25 percent, with Use Permit approval in compliance with Section D6.28 (Use Permits and Minor Use Permits), and only when additional landscaping and pedestrian amenities are also provided to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator. C. Bench or bleacher seating. Where fixed seating (e.g., benches, bleachers, pews, or similar seating) is provided, a seat shall be defined as 18 inches of bench space for the purpose of
calculating the number of required parking spaces as provided in Table 3-8. D. Nonconforming parking. A structure with nonconforming off-street parking may be physically changed or undergo a change in use subject to the following provisions.
1. Residential uses. No additional parking spaces shall be required; provided, the change does not increase the floor area, nor increase the number of dwelling units, nor eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or access.
Parking and Loading D3
Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-37
2. Nonresidential uses. The number of existing parking spaces shall be maintained on the site
and additional parking shall be provided in compliance with this Chapter for any additional floor area. If the use of the structure is changed to one that requires more parking than the
previous use, the difference between the parking spaces required for the previous use and
the new use shall be provided.
3. Waiver by Commission. The Commission may waive covered parking requirements when a nonconforming structure is proposed for rehabilitation if the Commission determines, in
compliance with Section D6.28 (Use Permits and Minor Use Permits), that the existing structure location, lot size, or topography renders the requirement infeasible.

D3-29 - Disabled Parking Requirements
A. Accessibility requirements. Parking facilities shall be properly designed, constructed, and
maintained to provide for access by the physically disabled from public rights-of-way, across intervening parking spaces, and into structures, including parking spaces specifically designed and located for the use of the disabled/handicapped. Standards for the facilities shall be based on the standards of the American Standards Association and/or other applicable guidelines.
B. Number and location of and access to spaces required. Parking spaces for the disabled shall be provided in compliance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), the Federal Accessibility Guidelines, the California Code of Regulations (Title 24, Part 2, Chapter 2-71), and with the sign
requirements of the California Vehicle Code, Section 22507.8., as applicable. Parking spaces required for the disabled shall count toward compliance with the number of off-street parking spaces required by Section D3-28 (Number of Parking Spaces Required).
D3-30 - Reduction of Parking Requirements
A. Shared Collective parking. Where two or more adjacent nonresidential uses have distinct and differing peak parking usage periods, (e.g. a theater and a bank), a reduction in the required
number of parking spaces may be allowed through Minor Use Permit or Use Permit approval.
1. Shared Collective parking requirements.
a. The Zoning Administrator may reduce the number of parking spaces required by Section D3-28 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) and D3-39 (Loading Space Requirements) by up to 25 percent with approval of a Minor Use Permit. Parking reductions greater than 25 percent may be allowed with approval of a Use Permit by the
Planning Commission.
b. An application for a Minor Use Permit or Use Permit for Shared Collective parking may be required to submit survey data substantiating a request for reduced parking requirements.
c. A Minor Use Permit or Use Permit for Shared Collective parking shall describe the limits of any area subject to reduced parking requirements and the reduction applicable to
each use.
d. In retail centers, office uses and medical uses which require additional parking beyond
that required for retail uses may be allowed; provided, their total combined gross square footage does not exceed 25 percent of the gross floor area of the retail center.
2. Findings. A Minor Use Permit or Use Permit may be approved to allow shared/collective
parking serving more than one use or site and located in a zone in which parking for the uses served is an allowed use. A Minor Use Permit or Use Permit for shared/collective off-street parking may reduce the total number of spaces required by this Chapter only if the following findings are first made:
a. The spaces to be provided would be available as long as the uses requiring the spaces are in operation;
b. The peak hours of parking demand from all uses do not coincide so that peak demand is greater than the parking provided;
c. The adequacy of the quantity and efficiency of parking provided will equal or exceed the
level that can be expected if collective parking is not provided; and
Parking and Loading D3
Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-46
d. A written agreement between landowner(s) and the City, in a form satisfactory to the
City Attorney, is approved by the Zoning Administrator. This agreement shall be in the form capable of and subject to being recorded to constitute a covenant running with the
land and shall include:
(1) A guarantee that there will be no substantial alteration in the uses that will create a greater demand for parking;
(2) A guarantee among the landowner(s) for access to and use of the shared parking
facilities;
(3) A provision that the City may require parking facilities in addition to those originally approved upon finding by the Zoning Administrator that adequate parking to serve
the use(s) has not been provided; and
(4) A provision stating that the City, acting through the Zoning Administrator, may for due cause and upon notice and hearing, unilaterally amend, modify, or terminate
the agreement at any time.
B. Reduction of parking. The Zoning Administrator may reduce the number of parking spaces required by Sections D3-28 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) and D3-39 (Loading Space Requirements) by up to 15 percent through a Minor Exception approval (Section D6-24 Minor Exceptions), or between 15.1 percent to 25 percent through a Minor Use Permit approval based on
the finding below, justifiable cause beyond simply the desire for less parking and based on the
reasonable existing and future use of the property. Parking reductions greater than 25 percent may be allowed with approval of a Use Permit by the Planning Commission.
1. Findings. A Minor Exception, Minor Use Permit, or Use Permit may be approved to reduce
the number of spaces to less than the number identified in this Chapter; provided, the
following findings are first made:
a. The parking demand would be less than the requirements identified in Table 3-8 (Parking Requirements by Land Use ) and Table 3-14 (Loading Spaces Required), below; and
b. The probable long-term occupancy of the structure, based on its design, would not generate additional parking demand.
2. Consideration of survey data. In reaching a decision, the Zoning Administrator shall consider survey data submitted by the applicant or collected at the applicant's request and expense that documents the need for fewer spaces (e.g., sales receipts, documentation of customer frequency, information on parking standards required for the proposed land use by other cities, etc.).
3. Land banking. Upon a determination of the Zoning Administrator, Land banking may be required and a portion of the required parking may be deferred if it is first found that all of the spaces are not needed immediately and that a Minor Use Permit could be granted in compliance with Section D6.28 (Use Permits and Minor Use Permits). Land set aside for future parking areas shall be maintained in a use that can be easily converted to parking area when needed (i.e. Landscaping). Land banking parking areas shall not include permanent buildings, major utilities or required circulation areas that would prohibit the future installation
of required parking,
C. Reduced parking for restricted senior housing projects. The review authority may reduce the number of parking spaces required by Section D3-28 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) for senior housing projects, for persons aged 55 and over, based on quantitative information provided
by the applicant that documents the need for fewer spaces for these types of residential development projects.

Division D3  Site Planning and Project Design Standards  Effective March 28, 2018 3-47
D. Waiver of covered parking requirement for affordable housing units. The review authority may waive the requirement that parking be covered for affordable housing units in compliance with the Citys density bonus regulations.
E. Parking in-lieu payments.
1. Cash in-lieu payment. Within designated parking districts established by the City Council and shown on the zoning map, a parking requirement serving nonresidential uses on a site
may be met by a cash in-lieu payment to the City before issuance of a Building Permit, or a Certificate of Occupancy, if no Building Permit is required.
2. Fee to provide off-street parking. The fee shall be collected and spent in order to provide public off-street parking in the vicinity of the use.
3. City may set limitations. In establishing the parking districts, the City may set limitations on the number of spaces or the maximum percentage of parking spaces required for which an inlieu fee may be collected.
F. Parking for large office complexes. The review authority may authorize the use of parking spaces measuring 8.5 feet by 18 feet for required parking if demonstration of participation within a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program is provided.
D3-31 - Parking Design and Development Standards
Required parking areas shall be designed, constructed, and properly maintained in compliance with this Section.
A. Location of parking. Off-street parking areas shall be located as follows:

2. Nonresidential parking. Parking for a nonresidential use shall be located in compliance with
Subsection D3-26.E. (Location and ownership), above.
3. Location of off-street parking spaces.
a. Required off-street parking spaces may occupy any part of the property in a nonresidential zone (e.g., commercial, industrial, etc.), except for the minimum perimeter plant strip required in compliance with Section D3-19.C.6, and the traffic safety visibility area with Section D3-6.F.
b. In any residential zone, required off-street parking for the main unit shall not be provided within any setback area or the traffic safety visibility area with Section D3-
6.F. However, parking may be allowed within that portion of any setback area used
for driveway access to required parking areas.
B. Access to parking. Access to parking shall be provided as follows for all parking areas other than for individual single-family residences. Site design shall minimize the amount of paved surfaces and driveway lengths while providing for safe and suitable access for vehicular circulation.
1. Parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering area so that vehicles exit to a street in a forward direction. Parking lots shall be designed to prevent access at any point other than at designated access drives. Single-family residences are exempt from this requirement.

2. A nonresidential use that is designed to provide 20 or more parking spaces shall have access driveways that are not intersected by a parking aisle, parking space, or another access driveway for a minimum distance of 20 feet from the street right-of-way, to provide a stacking
area for vehicles entering and exiting the parking area. 3. A minimum unobstructed clearance height of 14 feet shall be maintained above nonstructured parking areas accessible to vehicles. Structured parking areas (i.e., garage
parking) shall provide a minimum vertical clearance as required by Zoning Ordinance Section
D3-36.H C. Access to adjacent sites. The City may require the design of a parking area to provide vehicle
and pedestrian connections to parking areas on adjacent properties, to provide for convenience, safety, and efficient circulation. Where provided, a joint access agreement running with the land shall be recorded by the owners of the abutting properties, as approved by the Zoning Administrator, to guarantee the continued availability of the shared access between the properties.
D. Parking stall dimensions.
1. Minimum dimensions. Each off-street parking stall shall comply with the minimum dimension requirements in Table 3-9. Residential garages and carports shall comply with Subsections D3-35 B.

D4-1 - Purpose
A. Intent. It is the intent of this Chapter to provide special design guidelines, standards, and development regulations to regulate the time, place, and manner of the operation of Adult-Oriented Businesses in order to minimize the negative secondary effects associated with these business including, but not limited to, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses, including churches, parks, playgrounds, schools, and residential zones or uses. The Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere.
B. Purpose. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Chapter to:
1. Establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while allowing the location of Adult-Oriented Businesses in certain areas; and
2. Regulate Adult-Oriented Businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City.
C. Not purpose, intent, or effect. The provisions of this Chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to:
1. The Built Urban Land as identified in General Plan Figure 8-3 (Resource Management), except for creek setback regulations.
D5-4 - Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Area Development Standards
A. Development standards. Development proposed within the Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas shall comply with the development standards of the primary zone, except as follows.
1. Density. The density on all developable and undevelopable land shall be limited to the following densities based upon the existing natural slope as determined by the method described in Section D5-6 (Slope Methodology).
Note: (1) Densities may be averaged over the project site (Within these density ranges, units may be transferred so as to create a relatively even density gradient from higher density on 10 percent slopes to lower density on 20 percent slopes, without increasing the total number of units.)
Densities on undevelopable land may be exercised only upon transfer to developable land. Undevelopable land is defined by Zoning Ordinance
Division D8 (Glossary) as:
a. Land with an existing, natural slope in excess of 20 percent with a minimum elevation differential of 40 feet and a minimum contiguous area of three acres; or
b. Riparian corridors or associated vegetated areas of creeks, intermittent streams, perennial streams, or lakes.
Slope Density
Greater than 20 percent
1 dwelling unit per 320 acres
15 to 20 percent
1 dwelling unit per 5 acres (1)
10 to 15 percent
1 dwelling unit per 1 acre (1)
Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-5
2. Height Limit. Structures shall be limited to 32 feet in height measured from the lowest to the highest points of the structure which are above the ground. The review authority may allow up to a 15 percent increase in height for multi-family development projects that incorporate sustainable building and development practices similar to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold or Platinum certifications.
3. Building prohibited on undevelopable land. No building shall be allowed on undevelopable land, as defined in Zoning Ordinance Division D8 (Glossary) under "Resource Management," and the land shall not be included in density calculations that establish the development potential of a site. However, permanent open space dedication may include undevelopable land (see General Plan Table 4-4). Streets, driveways, non-residential accessory structures, park and recreation facilities and utilities may be constructed on undevelopable land. The review authority may allow minor grading (three acres or less) with review to create buildable lots on otherwise undevelopable land if a corresponding amount of contiguous land with slopes less than 20 percent is retained by deed restriction as permanent open space.
a. Exception: A single-family dwelling shall be permitted on a lot created prior to
October 25, 2012, provided there is a suitable building site and all structures, driveways and grading conform to the standards of this Section.
4. Ridgeline setback. No structure shall be located within 100 feet, measured vertically, of the centerline of a major ridge, or within 50 feet, measured vertically, of the centerline of a minor ridge. For purposes of this Section, the ridge centerlines shall be as identified in General Plan Figure 8-3 (Resource Management), unless the review authority approves a more precise delineation, based on a topographic map with a contour interval of not more than 10 feet.
a. Exception: Within pocket areas, as defined in Zoning Ordinance Division D8 (Glossary) under "Resource Management," the vertical ridge setback may be reduced by up to 50 percent and buildings may project, measured vertically, up to 33 percent into the reduced ridge setback area on not more than 25 percent of the lots upon making the following special Variance findings in addition to the Variance findings in Zoning Ordinance Section D6-29 (Variances):
i. The pocket development will not significantly impact visually, neighboring communities; and
ii. The exception meets the intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
Where structures are proposed within 1,000 feet of a major ridge as identified in General Plan Figure 8-3 (Resource Management), the building pad shall be graded and the building designed so that the structure maintains a low-profile appearance and conforms to the natural grade of the hillside, as determined by the review authority.
5. Street and driveway grades. Maximum street grades shall be 12 percent, and maximum driveway grades shall be 15 percent. Special streets, including one-way streets, split-level streets, and dead-end streets, and minor variations from the maximum grade standard, may be allowed when the review authority determines that their use is justified by detailed engineering and traffic circulation studies submitted by the applicant and approved by the City Engineer finding that the streets are necessary to achieve the purposes of this Section.
Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-6
6. Creek setback. No habitable structure shall be located within 100 feet of the centerline of a creek or stream channel identified in General Plan Figure 8-3 (Resource Management) plus any additional horizontal distance to be determined by an approved drainage report; provided that no habitable structure shall be located midslope or within the 100 year flood plain plus one foot of free board. Improvement within the setback areas shall be limited to open space and recreation amenities and access roads incidental to achieving effective circulation patterns.
a. Exception: A required creek setback may be modified to avoid a taking of
private property if
the review authority can make the following special Variance findings in addition
to the Variance findings in Zoning Ordinance Section D6-29 (Variances):
i. The modification is consistent with the General Plan;
ii. Riparian vegetation comprises less than 50 percent of the plant species within the normal 100-foot setback area;
iii. There is no historical evidence that riparian vegetation could be easily reestablished within a five-year period; and
iv. A reduced setback will not expose structures to bank erosion, or flooding damage, increase downstream flooding, flood hazard or impair access to the creek or stream channel for maintenance.
7. Creek Setback Development Standards. Development within a creek setback shall meet the following development standards:
a. Alteration of natural features. No grading or filling, planting of exotic/non-native or non-riparian plant species, or removal of native vegetation shall occur within a creek or creekside setback area, except where authorized for flood control purposes and by the proper permits issued by the California State Department of Fish and Game, all other applicable State and Federal agencies having authority over the creek
b. Design of drainage improvements. Where drainage improvements are required, they shall be placed in the least visible locations and in manners that achieve natural appearance through the use of river rock, earthtone concrete, and landscaping with native plant materials.
c. Use of permeable surfaces. The proposed development should incorporate permeable surfaces (for example, wood decks, sand-joined bricks, and stone walkways) where feasible, to minimize off-site flows and facilitate the absorption of water into the ground.
d. Creek bank stabilization. Development or land use changes that increase impervious surfaces or sedimentation may result in channel erosion. This may require measures to stabilize creek banks.
i. Creek rehabilitation is the preferred method of stabilization, with the objective of maintaining the natural character of the creek and riparian area. Rehabilitation may include enlarging the channel at points of obstruction, clearing obstructions at points of constriction, limiting uses in areas of excessive erosion, and restoring riparian vegetation.

General Plan Figure 8-3
Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-7
ii. Concrete channels and other mechanical stabilization measures shall not be allowed unless no other alternative exists.
iii. If bank stabilization requires other than rehabilitation or vegetative methods, hand-placed stone or rock rip-rap are the preferred methods.
e. Physical and visual access. The following physical and visual access standards shall apply unless a resource agency establishes a different standard for the project:
i. Public access and visibility to creeks should be provided through the use of single-lane width frontage roads adjacent to creeks, but outside of the creek setback. Structures or lots that back-up to creeks or creek frontage roads are discouraged.
ii. The provision of multipurpose creekside trails and public open space is encouraged. Open space areas should include planting for riparian enhancement with native shrubs and trees, paths and trails, lighting, benches, play and exercise equipment, and trash receptacles outside of the riparian habitat area, where appropriate.
iii. Where streets are not used, frequent access to creekside trails and public open space should be provided at least every 300 feet, and may occur at the end of cul-de-sacs.
D5-5 - Design Guidelines
A. Design Guidelines. Development proposed within the Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas shall consider the following guidelines:
1. Natural terrain alteration. Alterations of existing natural or artificial contours of land shall be minimized. Any natural contour altered by grading shall be rounded and shaped to simulate natural terrain, unless on an individual site this would diminish open space or significant natural features of the site. Grading shall follow the natural topographic contours as much as possible, allowing for multi-level foundations to accommodate differences in grade.
2. Viewshed Criteria. Development within the Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas shall consider the following viewshed criteria to promote architecture and designs that are compatible with the natural hillside terrain and minimize visual impacts:
a. Retain a significant portion of natural on-site vegetation to naturally screen structures;
b. Design and install landscaping to substantially screen structures;
c. Design project and site lighting to minimize off-site visibility and glare;
d. Blend the exterior color and materials with the surrounding vegetation and landforms;
e. Use of non-reflective windows and trim; and
f. Design roof angles and composition to conform to existing landforms and landscape
Additional photosimulations, studies, and/or other submittal items may be required by the review authority to determine compliance with the viewshed criteria.
Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Areas D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-8
3. Building and structure design standards. The following standards are intended to ensure that the design of structures conform to the natural land form and enhance the character of the site.
a. The use of multi-level foundations (floor levels separated by a minimum of four feet) shall be encouraged as the standard design for residential structures located on natural hillsides with slopes of 15 to 20 percent. This requirement does not apply to lots created prior to October 25, 2012.
b. Roof lines shall relate to the surrounding slope and topography.
c. Second-story levels of structures shall incorporate a variety of bays, recesses, overhangs, or setbacks, at the downhill side of the structure so that the appearance of vertical mass and the visual impact on the surrounding area are reduced.
d. All fencing shall be designed and located to be compatible with existing and proposed buildings and surrounding open space.
e. Exterior mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view. Equipment to be screened includes heating, air conditioning, refrigeration equipment, plumbing lines, ductwork, and transformers. Screening of the top of equipment may be required if necessary to protect views from a Residential Zone.
f. Exterior structural supports and undersides of floors and decks not enclosed by walls or otherwise screened and more than 12 feet high may be approved only if the Review Authority finds that no alternative type of construction is feasible, and fire-safety and design considerations have been adequately addressed.
g. A driveway serving three or more residences and that is not entirely visible from both ends shall have passing turnouts. Each driveway shall comply with minimum widths prescribed by the City Engineer.
h. A dwelling unit adjoining a street where parking is prohibited on both sides shall provide adequate guest parking as required by the Zoning Ordinance.

D5-6 - Slope Methodology
A. The purpose of this section is to establish slope methodology standards to achieve consistent application of the Hillside, Creek, and Ridgeline Development Standards in Section D5-4.
1. Grid. On a subject property, apply a 200 ft. by 200 ft. grid. Grids shall be placed as close as parallel as possible with the existing contour lines. Contour lines shall be drawn with a maximum interval of 10 ft. with 5 ft. intervals preferable.
2. Slope. Determine the average slope of each individual grid square. The average slope is determined by taking three (3) slope measurements within each grid square as follows:
a. Along the left boundary;
b. Along the right boundary, and
c. Along the center.
Average slope is determined by dividing the sum of the three measurements by three (3).
3. Allowed Density. Determine the allowed density for all full grid squares and partial grid squares based upon Section D5-4.A.1. The
total density shall equal the sum of the allowed density for all full grid squares and partial grid squares.
4. Net Developable Area. Determine the net developable area by deducting from the gross area the following areas on which buildings and/or structures are prohibited:
a. Existing natural slopes greater than 20 percent;
b. Major and minor ridge and creek setback areas as identified in General Plan Figure 8-3 (Resource Management)
5. Net Density. Determine net density as the Allowed Density divided by the Net Developable Area.
6. General Plan Density. Compare the Net Density with the permitted General Plan density.
Average Slope Measurement:
= [(Slope of A-A) + (Slope of B-B) + (Slope of C-C)] / 3
= [(56/200) + (45/200) + (51/200)] / 3
= [(28.0%) + (22.5%) + (25.5%)] / 3
= 25.3%

Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-13
D5-10  Tree Planting and Replacement
The City's principal objective for the Tree Removal Permit process is the preservation and replacement of protected trees. Where the review authority determines that preservation is infeasible, replacement plantings or in-lieu fees may be required in compliance with this Section.
Replacement Trees for Existing Development
Removal of protected trees on already improved commercial or single-family residential property may be subject to replacement trees as determined by the Director or an arborists recommendation approved by the Director. The tree replacement ratio may depend on the ability of the property to accommodate replacement trees, as determined by the Director or an arborists recommendation approved by the Director.
Replacement Trees for Proposed Development
Subsection A through D are applicable to proposed subdivisions, new developments and/or other project requiring discretionary approval.
A. Extent of replacement required. The review authority may condition any Tree Removal Permit for the removal of a protected tree upon the replacement of trees in kind. The replacement requirement shall be calculated as provided by Table 5-1. The review authority may reduce the required number of replacement trees if it is determined that the subject site would not adequately support the total number of required replacement trees. The review authority may approve a replacement program using one of the methods identified in Subsections B. through D., or any combination of the methods.

Tree Preservation and Protection D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-14
B. Location and specifications for replacement trees. The replacement trees required by Table 5-1 shall be planted on site (the City's preferred method of mitigation), except that the review authority may authorize other areas within the City where maintenance to ensure survival of the trees will be guaranteed.
1. All replacement trees shall be of the same native species as the trees being removed. In the case where an approved tree replacement location is characterized as non-native habitat such as an incompatible ornamental landscape, urban development, and/or narrow roadway median, the replacement tree may be non-native species.
2. Up to 50 percent of the required replacement trees may have a 5-gallon container size, where the review authority determines that long-term tree health and survival will be improved by starting with a smaller
container size, and that each tree with a container size less than 15
gallons will not be in a location where it will be more subject to damage while it is becoming established than a larger tree.
3. Replacement trees shall be in addition to any trees required by provisions of this Zoning Ordinance other than this Chapter (e.g., required parking lot landscaping or street trees).
C. Revegetation. The review authority may, instead of requiring replacement trees, require implementation of a revegetation plan.
1. The Developer shall enter into a written agreement with the City obligating the developer to comply with the requirements of the revegetation program.
2. A performance security or bond for 150 percent of the cost of the revegetation plan shall be required to insure that the agreement is fulfilled.
3. The revegetation program shall propagate native oak trees from seed using currently accepted methods, and shall identify the seed source of the trees to be propagated, the location of the plots, and the methods to be used to ensure success of the revegetation program.
4. A revegetation program shall not be considered complete until the trees to be propagated have survived in a healthy state for a minimum of 10 years, or the Commission has approved a revegetation program which demonstrates the need for alternative success criteria and achieves mitigation on an inch-for-inch basis.
D. In lieu mitigation fee. The review authority may determine that the remedies described above are not feasible or desirable and may instead require the payment of an in-lieu fee for the cost of purchasing, planting and irrigating the number of 15-gallon trees required by Table 5-1 and maintaining for five years. The in-lieu fee shall be calculated based on the unit cost (materials and labor) commonly used in estimating the landscape improvements at the time of the subject applications are deemed to be complete. The in-lieu fee shall be deposited into one of the following funds, as determined by the review authority:
1. Oak Tree Propagation Fund. This fund shall be used to propagate and protect native oak trees. Uses of the fund include, but are not limited to, purchasing property to plant or protect native oak trees, propagating native oak trees from seed or container stock and maintaining existing native oak trees.
2. Non Native Tree Fund. This fund shall be used to purchase and plant non-native trees within San Ramon. Uses of the fund include, but are not limited to, purchasing and propagating non-native trees from seed or container stock and maintaining existing non native trees.
Tree Preservation and Protection D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-15
E. Conditions for tree removal to accommodate agriculture. A Tree Removal Permit may be granted to allow tree removal within the HR, RC, and RE, zones to accommodate a commercial agricultural use, which is subject to a Minor Use Permit, without mitigation in compliance with Subsections A. through D., subject to the following conditions:
1. The agricultural use, as proposed and ultimately established, shall be limited to crop production, horticulture, orchards or vineyards, but shall not include grazing or other animal uses;
2. The Tree Permit shall be exercised within one year;
3. Once tree removal is commenced, the proposed replacement agricultural use shall be in place within 24 months of the removal of the first tree, or mitigation shall be required in compliance with Subsections A. through E.;
4. Once the replacement agricultural use is established, it shall be maintained for a minimum of five years. If the agricultural use is terminated before five years, and/or if a subdivision application for non-agricultural development is filed with the City within that period, or mitigation shall be required in compliance with Subsections A. through D.; and
5. The approved tree removal and subsequent agricultural use shall retain existing trees:
a. Around existing and proposed buildings;
b. Adjacent to parcel boundaries; and
c. In significant groves, as determined by the Director.
D5-11  Tree Permit Approval or Denial
Each Tree Removal Permit application shall be reviewed, and approved or denied in compliance with this Section.
A. Application evaluation criteria. The following criteria shall be used to support the findings required by Subsection B. for the approval of a Tree Removal Permit.
1. General criteria.
a. The gross floor area of proposed buildings in relation to the "usable" size of the site and the amount of usable space on the site that does not require the removal of protected trees;
b. Design features in comparison with other existing or approved projects in the vicinity and in the same zone that have or had protected trees on their sites;
c. Factors that are unique to the site, such as topographic constraints, lot configuration and other physical limitations;
d. The overall health and structural condition of the potentially impacted protected trees;
e. The approximate age of each protected tree compared with the average life span for each species;
f. The number of healthy protected trees that the site will support, with and without the proposed development;
g. The effect of tree removal on soil stability/erosion, particularly near watercourses or on steep slopes;
Tree Preservation and Protection D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-16
h. Whether there are any alternatives that would allow for the preservation of the protected tree; and
i. Any other information the review authority finds pertinent to the decision, including any information obtained at a public hearing.
2. Criteria for removal.
a. The age of the protected tree with regard to whether its removal would encourage healthier, more vigorous growth of younger similar trees in the area;
b. The number of existing protected trees in the area and the effect of removal upon public health, safety and the general welfare of the area;
c. The potential for the protected tree to be a public nuisance or interfere with utility service, as well as its proximity to existing structures; and
d. Present and future shade potential with regard to solar heating and cooling.
3. Criteria for encroachment. Whether the degree of encroachment is likely to result in the subsequent decline of the affected protected tree or create a future risk to public safety or pose a hazard to adjacent structures.
B. Required findings for approval. The approval of a Tree Permit shall require that the review authority first make all the following findings:
1. The approval of the Tree Permit will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, and approval of the Tree Permit is consistent with the provisions of this Chapter; and
2. Measures have been incorporated into the project or permit to mitigate impacts to remaining trees or to replace the trees removed.
C. Considerations for denial of a Tree Permit. A Tree Removal Permit shall be denied if the review authority finds that any one of the following situations exists.
1. Removal or damage of a healthy tree could be avoided by:
a. Reasonable redesign of the site plan;
b. Trimming, thinning, tree surgery, or other reasonable treatment, as determined by the review authority.
2. Adequate provisions for drainage, erosion control, land stability, windscreen, buffers along the road and between neighbors have not been made where these problems are anticipated as a result of the removal.
3. The tree to be removed contains an active nest of a bird covered by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, that has been identified through the project environmental review process or that is otherwise known to the review authority, and a qualified professional has determined that the relocation of the nest without damage to the nestlings is not possible. In this case, tree removal shall be delayed until nesting is complete.
Tree Preservation and Protection D5
Division D5  Resource Management  Effective March 28, 2018 5-17
D. Limitation on approved activities. A Tree Removal Permit shall not be issued for temporary parking, or the storage of vehicles, trailers, equipment, construction materials, or temporary structures within the protected zone of a protected tree.
E. Conditions of approval. The approval of a Tree Removal Permit shall include conditions of approval as necessary to ensure compliance with Section D5-8 (Tree Planting and Replacement).
D5-12  Post Approval Procedures
The following procedures apply after the approval of a Tree Removal Permit application.
A. Appeals. The decision of the review authority shall be final unless an appeal is filed in compliance with Chapter D7-II (Appeals and Calls for Review).
B. Expiration/extension. Except where otherwise provided by this Chapter, a Tree Permit shall be exercised within six months from the date of approval or other time limit established through a concurrent land use permit approval. Time extensions, for up to a total of two additional years, may be granted in compliance with Chapter D6-III (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions). A Tree Permit not exercised within its time limits shall expire in compliance with Chapter D6-III.
C. Performance guarantee. The review authority may require that a monetary security deposit be posted and maintained where deemed necessary to ensure:
1. The preservation of protected trees during construction;
2. The completion of required mitigation measures; and
3. In the case of tree removal within the RC zone to accommodate an agricultural use, the establishment of the proposed agricultural use.
The deposit shall be posted in a form approved by the City Attorney prior to any grading or movement of heavy equipment onto the site or issuance of any permits. Each violation of any Tree Removal Permit condition regarding tree preservation shall result in forfeiture of a portion or the entirety of the deposit, at the discretion of the review authority, provided that this determination may be appealed in compliance with Chapter D7-II.
D. Construction monitoring. Monitoring of tree protection and restoration measure specified as conditions of approval shall be performed by site inspection conducted by the Director or the Directors designee.
E. Revocation. A Tree Removal Permit may be revoked or modified, as deemed necessary by the Director, with any of the following findings that the tree removal, relocation, or protection activities:
1. Cannot support the original findings;
2. Resulted from misrepresentation or fraud;
3. Has not been implemented in a timely manner;
4. Has not met, or has violated any condition of approval;

(5) The Zoning Administrator may require a Minor Use Permit pursuant to Section D6-30(C)
D6-15 - Multiple Permit Applications
A. Concurrent filing. When a single project incorporates different land uses or features so that this Zoning Ordinance requires multiple land use permit applications, the Zoning Administrator may determine that all of the applications shall be filed concurrently, and reviewed, and approved or disapproved, by the highest level review authority assigned by Table 6-1 to any of the required applications. (For example, a project that requires a Zoning Map amendment and a Use Permit may be reviewed, and approved or disapproved by the Council (after a recommendation from the Commission), where a Use Permit application by itself may be reviewed and acted upon by the Zoning Administrator.)
B. Master application. The Zoning Administrator may authorize use of a single application form and submittal materials for multiple land use applications required by this Zoning Ordinance.
D6-16 - Application Preparation and Filing
A. Pre-application conference. A prospective applicant is strongly encouraged to request a pre-application conference with the Planning Division before completing and filing a planning permit application.
1. The purpose of this conference is to generally:
a. Inform the applicant of City requirements as they apply to the proposed project;
b. Review the City's review process, possible project alternatives or modifications; and
c. Identify the information and materials the City will require with the application, and any necessary technical studies and information relating to the environmental review of the project.
2. Neither the pre-application review nor the provision of information and pertinent policies shall be construed as either a recommendation for approval or disapproval of the application or project by any City staff.
3. A failure by City staff to identify all required studies or all applicable requirements shall not constitute a waiver of the requirements.
Permit Application Filing and Processing D6
Division D6  Planning Permit Procedures  Effective March 28, 2018 6-6

1. The owner of the subject property; or
2. Any authorized agent or representative, with the written consent of the property owner.
D. Zoning Administrators determination. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application does not support a prima facie right to the granting of the application (e.g., a request for a Zoning Map amendment or Tentative Map that could not be granted in absence of a required General Plan amendment application, or a request for an Use Permit allowing a use that is not allowable in the subject zone, etc.), the City shall not accept the application.
D6-17 - Application Fees
A. Fee schedule. The Council shall establish a schedule of fees for the processing of the applications required by this Zoning Ordinance, hereafter referred to as the City's Fee Schedule.
B. Multiple applications. The City's processing fees are cumulative. For example, if a proposed project requires the approval of both a Use Permit and a Variance, both fees will be charged. Large or complex projects may be subject to an hourly rate in addition to the basic application fees, at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
C. Timing of payment. No application shall be deemed complete, and processing shall not commence on any application until all required fees/deposits have been paid.

This Chapter provides regulations for nonconforming uses, structures, and parcels that were lawful before the adoption, or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the current terms of this Zoning Ordinance, or future amendments.
B. Intent. It is generally the intent of this Chapter to discourage the long-term continuance of nonconformities, providing for their eventual elimination, while allowing them to exist under the limited conditions identified in this Chapter.
C. Detrimental to orderly development. The continuance of a nonconforming use or structure is generally detrimental to the orderly development of the City and the general welfare of its residents and is particularly detrimental to the welfare of persons and property in the vicinity of any nonconformity.
D. Illegal use or structure. Any use or structure which was established or constructed in violation of the applicable zoning regulations in effect at the time of establishment or construction and which is not in conformity with the applicable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, is not a nonconforming use or structure, and the use or structure is in violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
D7-2 - Nonconforming Uses
A. Continued, transferred, or sold. Nonconforming uses may be continued, transferred, or sold, but only in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
B. Replacing nonconforming uses with similar uses.
1. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar or more restricted classification or nature; provided, the proposed new nonconforming use would not increase the degree or intensity of the nonconformity.
2. The replacement nonconforming use shall serve as the "new bench mark" in terms of establishing the acceptable level of nonconformity.
3. Where a nonconforming use is changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of a less restrictive classification.

1. If a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a conforming structure, is discontinued for a continuous period of at least 180 calendar days, the rights to legal nonconforming status shall terminate.
2. The nonconforming use shall not be resumed once the use has ceased for at least 180 days.
3. A nonconforming use shall be deemed to have ceased when it has been discontinued, either temporarily or permanently, whether or not the discontinuance was with the intent to abandon the use.
4. The Zoning Administrator shall base a determination of discontinuance on evidence including the removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, disconnected or discontinued utilities, or no business receipts/records to document continued operation.

Appendix A - Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines - Effective March 28, 2018 9-1
Appendix A
Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines
The following guidelines illustrate a methodology for the redevelopment of existing commercial strip centers into pedestrian-oriented districts. The City will use these guidelines in reviewing proposals to change existing shopping centers.
Purpose. In order to illustrate the potential for redevelopment of commercial properties into vibrant, mixed-use centers, a hypothetical strip mall was created at the intersection of two arterial streets. This 10-acre property accommodates approximately 115,000 gross square feet (gsf) of commercial space and includes a 60,000 gsf retail anchor. It is served by approximately 815 surface parking spaces (a standard 8:1 ratio).
The following pages illustrate a series of design principles that may guide the redevelopment of similar properties, as well as a strategy for successful phasing such a project.
City of San Ramon Zoning Ordinance D9
Appendix A - Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines - Effective March 28, 2018 9-2
Above: Existing conditions.
Principle One: Subdivide the property into an interconnected network of pedestrian-scaled streets and blocks.
Principle Two: Parking should be located along streets and in lots and garages oriented behind buildings.
City of San Ramon Zoning Ordinance D9
Appendix A - Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines - Effective March 28, 2018 9-3
Principle Three: New buildings should be oriented towards streets and provide a scale and interest that is pedestrian friendly.
Principle Four: A comprehensive network of parks and open space should provide the community with a series of public places.
Principle Five: Built frameworks should provide pedestrian-friendly connections to neighboring properties and future redevelopment sites.
City of San Ramon Zoning Ordinance D9
Appendix A - Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines - Effective March 28, 2018 9-4
Above: Existing conditions within suburban context.
Phase I: A portion of the strip mall is demolished and redeveloped as a mixed-use main street fronting a linear park. A parking structure is built to accommodate lost parking and new residential uses. The existing anchor use is renovated to appropriately terminate this new axis.
Phase II: A second mixed-use address is introduced along with a parking structure serving new retail and residential uses, creating a nascent town center district.
City of San Ramon Zoning Ordinance D9
Appendix A - Mixed Use Zone Redevelopment Guidelines - Effective March 28, 2018 9-5
Phase III: The remainder of the property is redeveloped with the addition of street-facing buildings along the sites perimeter, as the arterial streets gradually evolve into avenues and boulevards that are more pedestrian-friendly.
The above drawing illustrates one way in which such a site could be redeveloped, integrating new and renovated commercial uses, residential uses in a variety of forms, and civic and open space. The redevelopment of one property can spur the redevelopment of adjacent underutilized sites, creating the long-term potential for the creation of a vibrant, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly quarter.
