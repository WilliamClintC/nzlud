sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance
sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already in the Code.

return it, pay the donor the full value of the gift, or donate it to a nonprofit organization,

associated will derive a direct monetary gain or suffer a direct monetary loss, as the case may be,
by reason of his or her official activity. Any such public official or public employee does not have
an interest which is in substantial conflict with the discharge or his or her duties in the public
interest and of his or her responsibilities as prescribed by law if any benefit or detriment accrues to
himself or herself, his or her spouse, dependent child or to a business with which he or she, his or
her spouse or dependent child is associated as a member of a profession, occupation or group to
no greater extent than to any other member of such profession, occupation or group.

employee or public official shall appear on behalf of private interests before any board,
agency, or committee of the municipality.

municipality other than per-diem payments and reimbursement of expenses, no public
employee or public official shall represent private interests against the interest of the
municipality in any litigation to which the municipality is a party.
Nothing contained in this code shall prohibit or restrict a public employee or public official from
appearing before any board or commission of the municipality on his or her own behalf, or from
being a party in any action, proceeding or litigation brought by or against the public employee or
public official to which the municipality is a party.
No public employee or public official shall disclose confidential information concerning municipal
affairs, nor shall he or she use such information for the financial interests of himself or herself or
others.
No public employee or public official shall request or permit the use of municipal-owned vehicles,
equipment, facilities, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such
are available to the public generally or are provided as municipal policy for the use of such public
employee or public official in the conduct of official business.
No public employee or public official, or a relative or a business with which he or she is
associated, shall enter into a contract with the municipality unless it is awarded through a process
of public notice and competitive bidding.

A partnership, corporation or other legal entity which engages in contracting through a certified or
registered general contractor, building contractor, architect, or engineer. The design-build firm is

[1]
DESIGN CRITERIA PACKAGE
Performance-oriented specifications or drawings for a public construction project. The purpose of
the design criteria package is to furnish sufficient information so as to permit design-build firms to
prepare a bid or a response to request for proposal. Performance-based criteria for a public
construction project may include, but not be limited to, site dimensions, site development
requirements, provisions for utilities, conceptual or schematic drawings, interior space
requirements, parking requirements, material quality standards, a proposed design and
construction schedule, and any other requirements, terms or conditions as may be applicable to
the project.
DESIGN CRITERIA PROFESSIONAL
A professional registered to practice architecture, landscape architecture, or engineering.
§ 101-3. Issuance of design-build procurements.
Prior to the issuance of a design-build procurement, the design criteria package and cost estimate
shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Selectmen. Thereafter, the approved design-build
procurement shall be exempt from the bidding requirements described in the Town's Policy for the
Purchase and Disposition of Goods, Services, Equipment, Supplies, and Property for the Town of
Putnam.[1] A legal advertisement describing the procurement shall be published once in a newspaper
circulated in the Town of Putnam at least 10 working days prior to the response deadline.
Editor's Note: See Art. II of this chapter.
§ 101-4. Request for qualification process.
To procure a design-build contract, the Town may use either a one-stage bid process or a two-stage
request for qualifications and request for proposals process. If the Town elects to use the two-stage
process, it shall prequalify and select no fewer than three design-build firms as the most qualified
based on any combination of the qualifications of those who would work on the project, availability,
prior similar experience, and past performance on public and private projects, including that of the
partners or members, or financial stability.
§ 101-5. Solicitation and review of bids or proposals.
Design-build bids or proposals shall be solicited from design-build firms pursuant to a design criteria
package. Where a request for qualification process has been utilized, a request for proposals may be
exclusively directed to the proposers deemed prequalified without further legal advertisements.
Design-build contract responses shall be evaluated and selected based on price, value of the program
of improvements proposed, design-build firm qualifications and experience, and technical and design
aspects of the public construction project. The Town may pre-establish a cost reimbursement not-toexceed
guaranteed maximum price and base its selection upon the value of the program of
improvements proposed for the pre-established price. The design-build contract shall be negotiated
first with the proposer whose response is deemed by the awarding authority to be of the overall "best"
quality in providing the services desired, taking into account the criteria for evaluating responses,
requirements, terms and conditions contained in the procurement documents; all responses shall be
ranked in the order of their overall quality. The awarding authority's representative shall then negotiate

§ 140-1. Findings and purpose.
The Town Meeting of the Town of Putnam, Connecticut finds:
Should adult-oriented establishments locate in the Town of Putnam, they will require special
supervision from the Town's public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve the health,
safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the health, safety and welfare
of the Town's citizens.
Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States
indicate that:
Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adult-oriented establishments,
especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private
viewing of so-called "adult" motion pictures and/or videotapes and/or live entertainment; and
Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or
customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual
acts; and
Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to
provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such
booths, cubicles and rooms; and
Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of
such booths, cubicles, studios, and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles,
studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and
rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes or others, thereby promoting and
encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and
urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms,
which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may
come into contact with such deposits; and

E.
The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tends to
discourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and thereby promotes the health, safety and
welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments.
The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments, including, without limitation, those
specifically cited Subsection A hereof, would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and
safety of the citizens of Putnam.
The Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the Town powers, especially
police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adultoriented
establishments as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
It is not the intent of the Town Meeting, in enacting this chapter, to deny to any person rights to
speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the Town
Meeting to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by
enacting this chapter, the Town Meeting does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult
to obtain and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or State
Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that
distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit
such materials.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Municipal Powers Act of the Connecticut General Statutes
and general police powers, including those set forth in C.G.S. § 7-148(c)(7), and the Town Charter.
This chapter is intended to be enforced as a blight ordinance, pursuant to C.G.S. § 7-148(c)(7)(H),
and, because the Town has determined that blight is a significant nuisance to the Town, as a
nuisance ordinance, pursuant to C.G.S. § 7-148(c)(7)(E).
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Town of Putnam a number of blighted
properties and that continued existence of blighted properties constitutes a continuing nuisance
and contributes to the decline of neighborhoods and results in a deleterious effect upon
residential, commercial and industrial properties. Further, it is found that the existence of blight
adversely affects the economic well-being of the Town and is inimical to the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the Town of Putnam. Moreover, many of the blighted properties may be
rehabilitated, reconstructed, demolished, cleaned up, groomed, maintained, returned to
satisfactory condition or reused to provide decent, safe, sanitary housing or commercial facilities.
Such rehabilitation, reconstruction, demolition, cleanup or reuse of the most-egregious examples

written notice to an owner, agent, tenant or other person responsible for any violation and may
order the correction and cessation of such violation, which shall constitute an order to abate. The
notice may be hand-delivered or mailed to the last-known address of the owner, operator or any of
the persons identified in § 172-3. If the notice is mailed only to one of the responsible parties, it
shall in no way be or be construed to be a release of any other responsible party nor evidence that
any other party is responsible. If there is more than one responsible party identified in the order,
the responsibility for complying with the order shall be joint and several. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, the notice shall state the violation(s) of this chapter, and, when necessary for the
health and safety of Town residents, the enforcement officer may require abatement within 24
hours from the time of notification or immediately as may be necessary. Said notice may be
enforced by way of civil action. In any proceedings brought pursuant to Connecticut General
Statutes § 7-148(c), the owner and occupant of the property shall be given written notice of any
violation and provided a reasonable opportunity for the owner and occupant to remediate the
blighted conditions prior to any enforcement action being taken.
If the owner, agent, tenant or responsible person fails to correct the violations or fails to provide
notice to the Town of his or her intent to correct the violations set forth in the order to abate within
a reasonable period of time, and if any violation continues unabated after 20 days from the date
such order to abate is served, or if the owner fails to correct the violations as set forth in his or her
notice to the Town, the Town may issue an enforcement citation as specified in this chapter.
If the owner, agent, tenant or responsible person fails to correct the violations, the Town may take
any action necessary to abate the nuisance at any time after the initial seventy-two-hour notice at
the expense of the owners and send an invoice for the Town's costs of such abatement to the
owner of the property. The expense incurred by the Town to abate the violation, together with a
reasonable administrative fee that relates to the abatement, the amount as set forth in such
invoice, shall become a lien upon the land if such invoice remains unpaid for a period of over six
months, and said officer shall file upon the land records a notice of the lien, which shall state the
address of the property, the name of the record owner, and the amount of the lien. Said lien may
be foreclosed and enforced in the same manner as an emergency lien or other municipal lien.
If the Town is proceeding pursuant to C.G.S. § 7-148(c), any person who is a new owner or a new
occupant shall, upon request, be granted a thirty-day extension of the notice and an opportunity to
remediate provided pursuant to Subsection A of this section. For the purpose of this section, "new
owner" means any person or entity who has taken title to a property within 30 days of the notice,
and "new occupant" means any person who has taken occupancy of a property within 30 days of
the notice.
If the Town is pursuing a remedy pursuant to C.G.S. § 7-148(c), Subparagraph (H)(xv) of
Subdivision (7), an unpaid penalty imposed by the municipality pursuant to said sections shall
constitute a lien upon the real estate against which the penalty was imposed from the date of such
penalty. Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided by the
General Statutes for continuing, recording and releasing of property tax liens. Each such lien shall
take precedence over all other liens filed after July 1, 1997, and encumbrances except taxes and
may be enforced in the same manner as property tax liens.
§ 172-5. Hearing procedure for citations.
The Town of Putnam shall adopt hearing procedures for enforcement citations in compliance with the
requirements of C.G.S. § 7-152c as follows:
Hearing officers. The Mayor shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers, and the terms are
going to run from the date of appointment and shall terminate on the first Tuesday in December of
even-numbered years. No person who serves as a police officer or employee or person who
issues citations shall serve as a citation hearing officer. No appeal of a citation shall stay any
administrative or judicial proceedings upon the violation or upon a notice.

course.

proceedings, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making
the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within 10
days of the date of the initial notice as provided herein shall be deemed to have admitted
liability, and the designated municipal official shall certify such person's failure to respond to
the citation hearing officer. The citation hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the
fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances and shall follow the
procedures set forth herein and in § 7-152c of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Any person who requests a hearing within the time specified in this chapter will be given
written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing, which shall be held not less than 15

requests for good cause shown for continuance or postponement by an interested party. The
original or a certified copy of the initial notice of violation shall be filed and retained by the
municipality and shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of § 52-180 of the
Connecticut General Statutes and evidence of the facts contained therein. The accused shall
have the right to request the issuing official or police officer be present at the hearing, and
such individual shall in fact be present at the hearing if so requested. At such hearing, the
accused may appear and present evidence on his or her own behalf, and the designated
municipal official other than the citation hearing officer may present evidence on behalf of the
issuing official or the municipality. Any person who fails to appear may be defaulted and an
assessment by default entered against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and liability
under applicable statutes or ordinances. The hearing shall be conducted as set forth in § 7-
152c of the Connecticut General Statutes, and the citation hearing officer shall announce his
or her decision at the termination of the hearing.
Notice of assessment. If the assessment is not paid as of the date of its entry, the citation hearing
officer shall send by first-class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall
file not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months after such mailing, a certified copy of the
notice of the assessment with the Clerk of the Superior Court facility designated by the Chief Court
Administrator within the boundaries of the judicial district in which the municipality is located,
together with an entry fee of $8. A certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a
record of assessment, and the Clerk of the Superior Court shall enter judgment in the amount of
such record of assessment and court costs of $8 against such person in favor of the municipality.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Connecticut General Statutes, the citation hearing
officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the affect of a civil money
judgment, and a levy of execution on such judgment may be made without further notice to such
person.

Chapter 211. Flood Damage Prevention
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town of Putnam 10-17-1988 STM. Amendments noted where applicable.]
GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  Ch. 175.
Utilities  See Ch. 298.
Article I. Statutory Authorization; Findings; Purpose
§ 211-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has, in Section 7-148(c)(7) of the Connecticut General
Statutes, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town Meeting of
the Town of Putnam, Connecticut, ordains as follows.
§ 211-2. Findings.
The flood hazard areas of the Town of Putnam are subject to periodic inundation which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard area by uses
vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

§ 211-3. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage; and
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
§ 211-4. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
To protect human life and health;
To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects;
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone
areas in such manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Article II. Definitions
§ 211-5. Terms defined.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING)
Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected
by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is
connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new
construction.

value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the
structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value
of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, substantial
improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration
of floodwaters into the system.
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into floodwaters.
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
Manufactured homes.
All manufactured homes (including mobile homes placed on a site for 180 consecutive days
or longer) to be placed or substantially improved shall be elevated so that the lowest floor is
above the base flood elevation;
They shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to
which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors;
They shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage:
Adequate access and drainage should be provided.
Elevation construction standards include piling, foundations placed no more than 10 feet
apart, and reinforcement for piers more than six feet above ground level.
In any portion of a watercourse which is altered or relocated, the flood-carrying capacity shall
be maintained; and
A structure already in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be made
noncompliant by any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to the structure.
§ 211-17. Standards for streams without established base flood
elevations.
Any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including
data developed pursuant to § 211-15K of this chapter, shall be obtained, reviewed and reasonably
utilized as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
in Zone A on the Community's FIRM meets the standards in § 211-18 and Article VI.
In A Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is
designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one foot at any point along
the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed
development.
Should data be requested and/or provided, a regulatory floodway shall be adopted based on the
principal that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing
the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point along the watercourse.
§ 211-18. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, Zones A1-30, where base flood elevation data has been
provided, as set forth in § 211-7 or § 211-15K, the following provisions are required:

Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
Nonresidential construction.
New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
nonresidential structure located in Zones A1-30 shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to at least one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
Nonresidential structures located in all A-Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being
elevated, provided that, together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, the area
of the structure below the required elevation is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy are used. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural
design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for
meeting the provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the
Building Official as set forth in § 211-14A(2)(a).[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
I).
Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices,
provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood
elevation; and
Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways on the community's Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or as may have been
determined in § 211-15K. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
developments, shall be prohibited unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
In Zones AE along watercourses that have not been designated as a regulatory floodway, no new
construction, substantial improvement, or other development shall be permitted; unless it is

error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Building Official in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Inland Wetlands Commission or any person owning
land which abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of the land in question may appeal within 15 days
after such decision to the State Superior Court as provided in Section 8-8 of the Connecticut
General Statutes.
§ 211-21. Variances for specific situations.
Buildings on an historic register. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, except
for § 211-22C, and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not
result in the structure losing its historical character.
Preexisting, small lot location. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance

Functionally dependent uses. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvement and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use,
provided the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage,
create no additional threat to public safety and meet the requirements of § 211-22C.
Floodway prohibition. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
§ 211-22. Considerations for granting of variances.
In passing upon such applications, the Inland Wetlands Commission shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent
facility;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this chapter, the Inland
Wetlands Commission shall attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
Conditions for variances
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historical
building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the
historic character and design of the building.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;

A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship;
and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to who a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be
built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25. for $100. of
insurance coverage.
The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.[1]

jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters; of any ashes, shavings or sawdust, metal,
sticks, coarse rubbish, glass, rags, tar, feathers, plastics, waste rubber, animal guts, or tissues,
entrails, blood, hair hides, wood, paunch manure, or any other substance likely to damage,
destroy or cause an obstruction to the flow in any sewer or which may interfere with the proper
operation of the sewerage works.
Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits
established by the Water Pollution Control Authority in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.
Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.0 or higher than 9.5 or having any other corrosive

§ 312-37. Remediation of restricted discharges.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers,
which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in § 312-36 of
this article, and which, in the judgment of the Water Pollution Control Authority, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewerage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Water Pollution Control
Authority may:
Reject the wastes.
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers.
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.

Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
§ 312-40. Monitoring of discharges.
When required by the Water Pollution Control Authority, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such
necessary meters and other appurtenances, in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling,
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Water Pollution Control
Authority. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times. All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform
such monitoring of their discharge as the Director and/or other duly authorized employees of the City
may reasonably require, including installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping
records and reporting the results of such monitoring to the Director. Such records shall be made
available upon request by the Director to other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the
receiving waters.

§ 312-41. Determination of analyses required.
All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is
made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for
the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect
the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb, and property. (The particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be
taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-fourhour
composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)
§ 312-42. Special agreements.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the Water Pollution Control Authority and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Water Pollution Control
Authority for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided that such
agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing state and federal laws and are compatible
with any user charge and industrial cost recovery SYSTEM IN effect. Notification of any such special
agreements must be given to the Common Council by the Water Pollution Control Authority.
Article VII. Protection From Damage
§ 312-43. Tampering with sewerage system prohibited.
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,

Part 5. Storm Sewer Management
[Adopted 10-21-2013 STM]
Article XIII. Management of Discharges
§ 312-78. Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of
stormwater runoff contribute to increased non-point-source pollution and degradation of
receiving waters.
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to
the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or
institutional establishments.
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically
dispersed, small-volume, nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on
receiving waters.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water
supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and
waters.
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into
the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Localities in the State of Connecticut are required to comply with a number of state and
federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of
stormwater runoff quality and non-point-source pollution due to improper nonstormwater
discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Therefore, the Town of Putnam adopts this Part 5 to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to
the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper

dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest
and will prevent threats to public health and safety and the environment.
§ 312-79. General provisions.
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this Part 5 is to protect the public health, safety, environment
and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate
storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This Part
establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this Part are:
To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by
any person;
To prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer
system;
To prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping
or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and
enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Part.
Applicability. The provisions of this Part 5 shall apply throughout the Town of Putnam.
Compatibility with other regulations. This Part 5 is not intended to modify or repeal any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this Part are in addition
to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law; and where
any provision of this Part imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or
imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this
Part 5 shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect
or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this
Part.
Responsibility for administration. The Putnam Board of Selectmen shall administer, implement,
and enforce the provisions of this Part 5. Day-to-day enforcement will be the responsibility of the
designated authorized agent.

following restrictions, conditions, or requirements limiting the use of water as necessary to protect the
water supply except as provided in § 314-10. The applicable restrictions, conditions or requirements
shall be included in the public notice required under § 314-6. Please note, the following restrictions are
listed to serve as examples of the types of water use restrictions that may be implemented.
Automatic sprinkler use. The use of automatic sprinkler systems is prohibited, except lawn
watering is permitted in order to establish and maintain newly laid sod or newly seeded grass
associated with new construction, and the testing of a customer's newly installed or newly repaired
sprinkler system by a commercial enterprise engaged in the installation or repair of lawn irrigation
systems is permitted.
Car washing. Car or vehicle washing is prohibited, except for the washing of vehicles performed
by a commercial enterprise engaged in car washing.
Loss of water from customer's service line. The loss of water through breaks or leaks within the
customer's service line, private distribution system or plumbing for any substantial period of time
within which such break or leak should reasonably have been discovered and corrected. It shall be
presumed that a period of 72 hours after the customer discovers such a break or leak or receives
notice from the water company of a break or leak is a reasonable time within which to correct such
break or leak or, as a minimum, to stop the flow of water from such break or leak.
Off-peak outdoor watering. Outdoor watering is permitted only during daily periods of low demand,
to be specified in the declaration of a state of water use restriction and public notice thereof. For
example, limit outdoor watering to between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. on not more than three days
per week. Houses with house numbers ending in an odd number shall water on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday; houses with a house number ending in an even number shall water on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. (In general, restricting outdoor water use to between sunset and
early morning is best for turf needs and coincides with off-peak hours. Municipalities may choose
to restrict water use to one or two days per week during specified hours.) During a declared water
supply emergency, outdoor watering may be entirely prohibited.
Other outdoor uses. The use of private wells or other outdoor uses not addressed in this chapter
that are, in the determination of the Director of Health, wasteful are prohibited.
Outdoor watering ban. Outdoor watering is prohibited, except the watering of agricultural products,
sod at commercial sod farms, and the watering of nursery stock at nurseries or retail outlets is
permitted.
Outdoor watering method restriction. Outdoor watering is restricted to bucket, can or hand-held
hose, or soaker hose watering with an automatic shutoff nozzle.
Swimming pools, wading pools, hot tubs, spas, and Jacuzzis. Filling and topping off of swimming
pools, wading pools, hot tubs, spas, and Jacuzzis are prohibited, unless newly constructed or
installed swimming pools, wading pools, hot tubs, spas, and Jacuzzis may be filled once upon
completion of construction or installation.
Use of water for fire-fighting, health, sanitation, and medical purposes. The use of water for firefighting,
health, sanitation, or medical purposes shall not be restricted. However, domestic water
use conservation practices should be implemented wherever possible.
Washing impervious surfaces. The washing or cleaning of streets, driveways, sidewalks or other
impervious areas is prohibited.
In any month that the WPCA is purchasing water from a public water system pursuant to
Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-348, or otherwise, the WPCA will enforce water
restrictions in the same manner as the public water system when necessary in accordance with
the emergency contingency provisions of the public water system.

B. Permits 
 
1. Except for necessary routine maintenance and for repairs or replacement to existing buildings, as defined in the basic Building Code of the State of Connecticut, no land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected, moved, enlarged or extended until a Zoning Permit and Building Permit for the proposed work or use has been issued by the Commission or the Agent in accordance with the requirements of the State of Connecticut Building Code. 


 
a. It shall be the responsibility of the Applicant to obtain all permits required by other agencies, if applicable, including other local authorities such as Northeast District Department of Health, the Inland Wetlands Commission, Aquifer Protection Commission, and any department or agency of the State or federal government. The applicant shall provide evidence of application to such agency or agencies, and no Zoning Permit shall be issued until evidence of application for all other permits has been submitted; provided, however, that the Commission may waive this requirement if the applicant provides evidence that the filing of the application with such agency or agencies requires preceding approval of the subject Zoning Permit by the Commission. 
 
C.  Application and Site Plan Requirements  
   
1.  Applications for Zoning Permits shall be filed with the Commission or its authorized agent by the owner or its authorized agent on a form provided by the Commission.

The purpose of a site plan is  to provide the Commission with information that will enable it to determine that the proposed buildings and uses shall be arranged in a manner that enhances the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Putnam and shall be of such character as to harmonize with the neighborhood, to accomplish a transition 
in character between areas of unlike character, to protect property values in the neighborhood, to preserve and protect natural resources and the appearance and beauty of the community and to avoid undue traffic congestion.   
 
a.  Approval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered by the Commission within 65 days after the date of receipt, except that such time period may be extended for not more than one (1) additional period of 65 days, with the consent of the applicant.

Such principles, methods and practices necessary for certification are found in the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (1985) as amended, available from the Natural Resources Center of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Alternative principles, methods, and practices may be used with prior approval of the Commission.  
 
a. After review of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Commission or its designated agent, the Commission shall vote to certify, modify and certify, or deny that the soil erosion and sediment control plan complies with these Regulations.  A vote of the Commission to approve a site plan shall mean certification of the erosion and sediment control plan as well. Prior to certification, any plan submitted to the Commission may be reviewed by the Eastern Connecticut Conservation District which may make recommendations concerning such plan, provided such review shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such plan by the District.

The Commission may require the applicant to submit progress reports which show that soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities have been performed or installed according to the certified plan and are being correctly operated and maintained.  


 
5. Waivers. The Commission may, upon written request by the applicant, waive one or more of the site plan element requirements if the applicant can show to the satisfaction of the Commission that the information is not needed to reach a decision on the application.  
 
6. Site Plan Evaluation. The Commission shall determine the following in its review of a site plan:  
 
a. Any proposed building or structure shall be so designed, and located on the site so that there will be adequate access for emergency vehicles; 


 
b. The streets serving the proposed use shall be adequate to safely carry the vehicular traffic generated by the proposed activity, and there will be provision for entrance and exit points which will not create a traffic hazard or undue traffic congestion;  


 
c. All proposed traffic access ways are adequate but not excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and visibility; not located too near street corners or other places of public assembly; and other similar safety considerations; 


 
d. Adequate off-street parking and loading spaces are provided to prevent parking in public streets of vehicles of any persons connected with or visiting the use and the interior circulation system is adequate to provide safe accessibility to all required off-street parking; 


 
e. All playground, parking and service areas are reasonably screened at all seasons of the year from the view of adjacent residential lots and streets and the general landscaping of the site is in character with that generally prevailing in the neighborhood. Preservation of existing trees over twelve (12) inches in diameter to the maximum extent possible shall be encouraged; 


 
f. Lighting from the installation of outdoor flood or spot lighting and illuminated signs will be properly shielded so that such lighting will not adversely affect any abutting property or public street; and

7. Site Plan Improvements and Financial Guarantee 
 
a. Completion of Improvements  All applicants shall be required to complete all improvements as specified in the approved site plan or as required in these regulations, and to dedicate public improvements to the Town, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. 



 
b. Financial Guarantee  In order to secure the completion of the construction of public improvements and the approved soil erosion and sediment control plan as depicted on the approved site plan, the applicant shall post a financial guarantee for the construction of such improvements before site plan approval is granted for a Zoning Permit, or in the case of a Special Permit  before the final site plan is endorsed by the Chairman or Secretary and filed on the land records with the Special Permit Document, in an amount established by the Commission based on an estimate provided by the applicant through his/her/its certified professional engineer, scientist, or other appropriate professional. This financial guarantee shall be in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit, a cash deposit with the Town, a bank passbook or statement savings account payable to the Town, or other financial guarantee as authorized by state statute.  If a letter of credit is used, it shall be satisfactory to the Town Attorney.   



 
The financial guarantee shall be accompanied by a written and executed agreement which shall be satisfactory to the Town Attorney. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be incorporated in the financial guarantee agreement and shall not in any event exceed the timeframe required by these Regulations. 
 
c. Failure to Complete Site Plan  Where a financial guarantee for the construction of improvements has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the time specified by the Commission the Town may thereupon declare the financial guarantee to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed. If necessary the Town shall, in addition to call the financial guarantee, proceed against the individual developer and/or owner of said premises. The continued maintenance of any agreed financial guarantee for the construction of improvements is a condition of approval of all site plans and the lapse or failure of such security financial guarantee prior to final release by the Commission shall be grounds for revocation of the site plan approval.  


 
d. Certificate of Satisfactory Completion  The  Commission will not recommend acceptance or dedication of required public improvements, nor release a financial guarantee for the construction of such improvements until all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the Commission, through submission of detailed "as-built" survey plans of the site plan, that the layout of soil erosion and sediment control improvements are in accordance with approved site plans and, in the case of public improvements, have been constructed in accordance with the approved site plans and are ready for dedication to the local government. Upon such approval and recommendation, the Town may thereafter accept the public improvements for dedication.  


 
e. In the event that certain improvements may not be installed at the time of occupancy of a site or building due to weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the applicant, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may issue a temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance at the time of the application for a Certificate of Occupancy, provided that the applicant shall insure the completion of such 


improvements not more than six (6) months following such occupancy. If said improvements are not completed within the six month period, the temporary occupancy certificate shall become invalid, and the permanent occupancy certificate shall not issue until all of the improvements depicted on the site plan have been completed. 


 
f. All financial guarantees posted in accordance with these Regulations shall be effective at least until the completion of the activity or development which they serve to guarantee. No such financial guarantee shall require the Town or any agency thereof to incur any expense or enter into any contract prior to payment of the obligation which such financial guarantee secures.  


 
8. Amendments to Approved Site Plan filed or Approved Special Permit Site Plan pursuant to Sections 113 and/or 114.  The agent designated by resolution of the Commission may approve a one (1) time administrative approval of the original Approved Site Plan filed or Special Permit Site Plan previously approved by the Commission, without public hearing, any proposed expansion, reduction of or enlargement of an existing building or the addition of a building or buildings that is/are necessary to the principal building and use provided:   
 
a. Such reduction of or enlargement of accessory building or buildings, individually or cumulatively, do not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the area of the principal buildings approved footprint, or 5,000 square feet, whichever is less.  


 
b. Any proposed reduction of or expansion or enlargement of an existing building or the addition of an accessory building or buildings shall conform to all of the requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located.  


 
c. No site work is required. Site work shall include additional parking spaces, storm drainage, or site disturbance of more than one quarter (1/4) of an acre, but shall not include the excavation or grading necessary and incidental to the construction of the new or expanded building or structure itself. 


 
d. Whether filed as a single application or as multiple applications, the reduction of or expansion or enlargement of an existing building or the addition of an accessory building or buildings which exceed, individually or cumulatively, the limitations of this administrative permit procedure shall require Special Permit or site plan review by the Commission in accordance with Sections 113 and/or 114 of these Regulations, as the case may be. 


 
e. The applicant shall file a detailed site plan and narrative explaining the proposed building reduction or expansion or proposed accessory building addition with the Commissions designated agent for review. The agent shall determine whether or not the proposed reduction or expansion satisfies the criteria to be permitted administratively or whether the expansion requires formal Special Permit or site plan review by the Commission. No such amendment shall be approved that substantially alters the uses, density, building coverage, or other elements of an approved Special Permit. 


 
 
9.  Minor Site Plan Amendments to Previously Approved Zoning Permits or Special Permits. An applicant may submit an application for a minor site plan amendment of an existing approved site plan as a Zoning Permit Application subject to established fees before the Commission. The Commission will review the proposed changes compared to the original approval and determine whether the scope of these changes would require a new permitting procedure including but not limited to application fees, new site plan documents and new public hearing. If the proposed changes in site plan are deemed by the Commission to be minor or allowable within the original scope of the permit, then the modifications may be made by administrative letter to file, reviewed by the Commissions designated agent and signed by the Chairman on behalf of the entire Commission. 
 
D.  Exemptions  
 
1. The Commission may waive any of the requirements found in  this Section if the following conditions exist or are met: 


 
a. The proposed activity does not involve the construction, erection, alteration, enlargement, removal or other modification of a principal building or structure; 


 
b. The proposed activity will not require the use of wells or sewage disposal facilities; and

2. No waiver under this Section shall be granted unless the applicant submits to the Commission, in writing, at the time of and together with the submission of its application, a request for a waiver specifying the requirements that the applicant seeks to have waived and the reasons why the applicant believes those requirements should be waived.  The Commission shall act on such request no later than thirty-five (35) days after the submission of the application, and written notice of any decision shall be mailed or delivered to the applicant.  The failure of the Commission to act on any request for a waiver within such time shall be deemed to be a denial of the request. 


 
3. The following structures shall not require the issuance of any permit under these regulations: 


  
a. Fences, or walls used as fences, that are no more than six (6) feet in height. 



 
b. Mailboxes.

Section 114  Special Permits 
 
A.  Purpose 
 
1.  The Commission may hear and decide on applications for a Special Permit.  





 
2.  The purpose of the special permit regulations is to provide a comprehensive review of the proposed plan for the layout of the building(s), structure(s) or use(s) in relationship to the topographical, geological and other natural features of the land, and of the impact of the use(s) upon environment, health, safety, welfare and convenience of the members of the community.  It is intended to insure that the design and layout of the site and the proposed use(s) will constitute suitable and appropriate development in character with the neighborhood and will not result in a decrease in property values or a detriment to the present and potential use of the area in which it is to be located.  Special permit procedures are also intended to assure that proposed buildings, structures and uses will provide for the maintenance of air, surface-water and groundwater quality and will not be detrimental to existing sources of potable water or other natural or historic resources. 





 
B.   When Required 
 
A special permit must be issued by the Commission before any person may establish or change any land use, or use, erect, construct, move, enlarge, or alter any building or structure, in whole or in part, if the use, structure or building resulting from such activity is listed as a Special Permitted Use under Section 304 of these regulations for the zone in which it would be located.  The issuance of a special permit under this Section of these regulations fulfills the requirement for the issuance of a zoning permit under Section 113.   
 
 
C.   Applications 
 
1. Applications for special permits shall be filed with the Commission on a form provided by the Commission.  Five copies of each application shall be submitted, accompanied by three (3) copies of a site plan in ink at a scale of one inch equal to no more than forty (40) feet and showing: 


 
a. All the information specified for a site plan under Section 113 of these regulations. 


 
b. The nature and amount of any hazardous materials or wastes to be produced, used, stored or disposed of on the lot, and the manner in which such production, use, storage or disposal will be carried out.  


 
c. The nature of existing land uses on abutting properties. 


 
d. The names of all owners of record of property abutting or within one hundred (100) feet of the lot to which the special permit would apply. 


 
e. The location of rock outcropping slopes in excess of fifteen (15) percent, soil types and forested areas on the lot. 


 
f. The location and description of any measures to be used to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. 


 
g. The location and a description of any proposed surface or subsurface drainage improvements, facilities or structures.  


 
h. The location of soil test pits and test borings and a description of the soils encountered in such pits or borings. 


 
i. The location of any areas subject to flooding during a 100-year flood, as shown on the most recent Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 


 
j. The location and nature of any proposed landscaping, buffer areas or screening, and any existing or proposed fences or walls. 


 
The filing of a site plan subject to the application for a special permit under this Section 114 shall supersede and alleviate the need to file a separate site plan application under Section 113 of these regulations. 
 
2. Each application for a special permit shall also be accompanied by three (3) copies of: 


 
a. A traffic report indicating existing traffic conditions at normal and peak travel times for, at a minimum, any road abutting or passing through the lot affected by the application and any road within the area directly impacted by the traffic generated by the proposed use of such lot, and also indicating the projected impact of the proposed use on such traffic conditions. 


 
b. The schedule for any construction or other development activities, including, but not limited to, erection of or other work on any buildings or structures, grading, removal of vegetation, landscaping and drainage improvements.  


 
D.   Waiver of Certain Requirements for Special Permits 
 
1. The Commission may waive any of the requirements for site plans under Section 113 of these regulations if the Commission determines that the requirements sought to be waived are not reasonably necessary to a proper disposition of the application. 


 
2. No waiver under this Section shall be granted unless the applicant submits to the Commission, in writing, at the time of and together with the submission of the application, a request for a waiver specifying the requirements that the applicant seeks to have waived and the reasons why the applicant believes those requirements should be waived.  The Commission shall act on such requests no later than thirty-five (35) days after the submission of the application, and written notice of any decision shall be mailed or delivered to the applicant.  The failure of the Commission to act on any request for a waiver within such time shall be deemed to be a denial of the request. 


 
E. Additional Requirements for Applications 
 
1. The Commission may, within thirty-five (35) days after the submission of an application for a special permit, require the applicant to submit additional information if the Commission finds that such information is necessary or would be helpful in determining whether the proposed buildings, structures or uses conform to these regulations.  Such information may include, but is not limited to, the following:

2.   If the applicant elects to furnish the additional information required by the Commission, the applicant shall file with the Commission a written consent to the extension, for an additional period of thirty-five (35) days of the time within which the Commission would otherwise be required by law to commence a public hearing.  If the applicant declines or fails to furnish the additional information, the Commission shall proceed to act upon the application pursuant to these regulations. 
 
F.  Criteria for Evaluation 
 
1.  In deciding upon any application for a special permit, the Commission shall consider the following criteria in addition to the other applicable criteria set forth in other sections of these regulations:  
 
a. The size and intensity of the proposed use and the impact of such use on neighboring property. 


 
b. The potential for creation of a nuisance to neighboring properties, whether by noise, air or water pollution, offensive odors, smoke, dust, vibrations or other effects of the proposed use.  


 
c. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement on the site, and the impact of the proposed uses on existing local traffic.

g. Measures for dealing with runoff and surface pollutants from driveway and parking areas. 


 
h. The compatibility of the design, layout and operation of the proposed buildings, structures or uses with nearby properties and the impacts on the enjoyment, usefulness and value of nearby property. 


 
i. The degree of population concentration and building density resulting from the proposed uses and the availability and adequacy of existing fire and police protection, transportation, water, sewage, facilities, schools or other public facilities to meet the needs  of the uses. 


 
j. The impact of the proposed uses on existing or potential local water supplies and recharge areas.  


 
k. The existence and protection of important natural and historic resources. 


 
l. The impact of the proposed uses on wildlife and plant habitats. 


 
G.  Conditions 
 
1.   The Commission may place on any special permit whatever conditions the Commission may reasonably deem necessary to assure that any proposed building, structure or use (1) will conform to the standards and limitations set forth in these regulations; (2) will protect the rights of individuals  and the health, safety, welfare and convenience of local residents and the community; (3) will protect local property values; and (4) will meet the specific standards set forth in this Section and, where applicable, any special permit criteria that may be required to meet the conditions of other sections of these regulations.  The conditions may relate to, without limitation, the architectural and spatial design and layout of buildings, structures and uses; provisions for lighting, parking, loading, surface and subsurface drainage, sanitary facilities, waste disposal, vehicle and pedestrian circulation, landscaping, screening, and protection of the environment and of natural and historic resources; construction or other development schedules; and hours of operation of the proposed building, structure or use.  The Commission may also condition the issuance of any special permit on the posting of a bond or other security, in an amount and with surety satisfactory to the Commission, to secure the performance of all conditions and the completion of all improvements required under such special permit. 
 
2. All buildings, structures and uses for which a special permit is required under these regulations must meet the applicable standards set forth throughout these regulations and, in addition, the following standards: 
 
a. Preservation of landscape.  The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as practicable by minimizing grading and the removal of vegetation and soil.  Where vegetative cover does not exist, or has been removed, new plantings may be required.  Finished site contours shall depart only minimally from the character of the natural site and the surrounding properties.  


 
b. Relation of Buildings to Environment.  The proposed project or development shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to the use, scale and siting of existing buildings in the vicinity of the site.  All buildings and other structures shall be sited to minimize disruption of the topography.  Strict attention shall be given to the proper functional, visual and spatial relationships of all structures, buildings, landscaped elements and paved areas.  


 
c. Buffer Areas.  All buffered and/or screened areas, including setback areas (landscaped and usable), shall be so designed as to be consistent and compatible with any residential uses in the vicinity. 


 
d. Circulation.  With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including entrances, ramps, walkways, drives and parking, special attention shall be given to the location and number of access points to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, access to community or public facilities, and arrangement of parking areas that area safe and convenient and, insofar as practicable, do not detract from the use and enjoyment of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties. 


 
e. Surface Water Drainage.  Special attention shall be given to proper surface drainage so that surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or public storm drainage facilities, will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, and will not create standing water in paved or pedestrian areas.  All surface water drained from roofs, streets, parking lots and other site features shall be disposed of in a safe and efficient manner that will not create problems of water runoff or erosion on the site or on neighboring sites or pollution of surface water or groundwater.  Insofar as possible natural drainage courses and swales shall be properly stabilized and drainage-impounding areas shall be used to dispose of water on the site through natural percolation to a degree equivalent to that prior to development.  Also appropriate erosion control measures shall be employed, including slope stabilization measures and the seeding of exposed areas to replace vegetative cover. 


 
f. Ground Water Recharge and Quality Preservation.  Ground water recharge shall be maximized and ground water quality shall be protected.  Various techniques may be required to maximize recharge, such as perforated drainpipes, pervious pavement, reduction of structure area, or reduction of lot coverage.  Where ground water elevations are close to the surface, extra site grading precautions may be required to maintain the protective function of the overburden. 


 
g. Utilities.  The placement of electric, telephone, or other utility lines and equipment shall be underground where possible, so located as to provide no adverse impact on groundwater levels, and coordinated with other utilities.  


 
h. Other Site Features.  Exposed storage or utility areas, exposed machinery installations, and service areas shall be designed with screen plantings, fencing or other screening methods to be compatible with the environment and the surrounding properties.  


 
i. Safety.  All open and enclosed spaces shall be designed to facilitate evacuation and maximize accessibility by fire, police and other emergency personnel equipment. 


 
j. Neighboring Properties.  The proposed uses shall not adversely affect the enjoyment, usefulness and value of the properties in the general vicinity thereof, or cause undue concentration of population or structures.   


 
k. Natural and Historic Resources.  The proposed uses shall not unreasonably destroy, damage or threaten locally significant natural or historical resources.

Industrial Heritage Overlay District Regulations 
 
A.  Statement of Purpose.  The Town seeks to protect its remaining historically and architecturally significant structures and, in doing so, to require consideration of the physical, architectural and cultural context of such structures before approving redevelopment proposals which would alter such structures to add residential uses. Industrial Heritage Overlay Districts are intended to encourage renovation and/or adaptive re-use of Putnams historic river mills, retain the potential for commercial and industrial development while permitting residential development, and preserve historic architectural design elements while adapting obsolete or underutilized structures and appurtenances to 21st Century needs. Factors to be considered by the Zoning Commission (the Commission) in approving an IHOD Special Permit include: 
 
1.  To the maximum feasible extent, preservation of buildings and building elements possessing historic or architectural significance. Building additions shall be architecturally compatible with existing historic structures and the neighborhood (when feasible), and respect exterior attributes of such structures and neighborhood. 





 
2.  Adaptive re-uses that promote and incorporate a mix of uses in a proportion and in a scale which promotes physical and economic compatibility and that enhance the opportunity for creative development provided that residential living units shall not exceed 75% of the total square feet of re-use. The type, density and placement of each proposed use shall be indicated in the IHOD Application. 





 
3.  Compatibility with neighboring land uses, safe site access and egress for vehicular traffic, promotion of pedestrian safety, and provision for adequate parking. Adverse impacts to the surrounding neighborhoods, such as excessive lighting or noise, shall be avoided or mitigated. 





 
4.  Promotion of the vitality of the towns riverfront, including to provide for the publics use and enjoyment, preserve the scenic quality of wetland habitat, promote river related recreation, and provide for the protection of the river bank. New uses locating in the Industrial Heritage Overlay District should be of pedestrian scale and orientation; ensure the publics visual access and enjoyment of the river; evoke a feeling of the industrial history of the area; include design orientation both to the river and to the public way; and integrate public outdoor activities.  




B. Non-Residential Mixed-Use Projects. In the IHOD, an IHOD Special Permit shall not be required for projects which do not include residential uses. Regulations for the underlying zoning district shall govern such non-residential mixed-use projects. 

C. IHOD Conceptual Development Plan.  Applicants are strongly recommended to initiate a pre-application meeting(s) with the Commission to allow informal discussion(s) between the applicant and the Commission of an IHOD Conceptual Development Plan.  This process is intended to provide the Applicant with the Commissions input on the proposed project, which the applicant can then utilize in preparation for the detailed engineering work necessary to prepare the formal submission of the IHOD Special Permit application and its accompanying Final Development Plan, thereby minimizing delay, expense, and inconvenience to all interested parties.  To facilitate productive discussion on the project, the IHOD Conceptual Development Plan should include all of the following exhibits: 


 
1.  Executive Summary: A summary description of the proposed project which includes a section proposing plans or reports to be included in the Final Development Plan. 



 
2.  Existing Site Conditions Plan. A submittal in the form of a map or an annotated aerial photograph showing property lines, the approximate location of existing site conditions and structures. 



 
3.  Preliminary Circulation Plan.

5.  Preliminary Building Elevations Plan.  A submittal, including renderings of architectural style, showing how the proposed project fits within the surrounding neighborhood context.   



Neither the pre-application meeting(s), the informal discussion(s) of the Concept Development Plan, nor the Commissions suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any portion of the IHOD special permit application. 
 
D. IHOD Special Permit Application Procedures. Projects which include residential uses within the Industrial Heritage Overlay District require approval from the Zoning Commission of an IHOD Special Permit for which an applicant must secure approval from the Commission of an IHOD Final Development Plan. Following an IHOD Special Permit application submittal, a hearing shall be scheduled with the Zoning Commission wherein the Owner/Developer presents the contents of the application and responds to questions from the Commission.  The Zoning Commission thereafter may indicate considerations, conditions, or requests for the IHOD Final Development Plan and ensure the resulting project is consistent with IHOD goals. If the Zoning Commission finds that a proposed IHOD Final Development Plan is in substantial accordance with or represents the purpose and intent of the IHOD District, and that all fee payments have been made, the Commission may then approve such IHOD Final Development Plan and cause an IHOD Special Permit to issue.

Screening of mechanical equipment, trash, and loading areas shall be provided through the use of walls, fences, and/or dense, evergreen plant materials. Existing trees shall be maintained as practicable and any new trees shall be carefully selected and located where they will complement the building elevation. Tree species, when additional trees are proposed, should be selected with root growth habits that will not cause damage to sidewalks, or such tree species should be sited away from such hardscape areas.  Street tree placement shall include consideration for vehicle line of sight, entrance and exit curb cuts, street light and traffic control devices, and other site specific conditions. 


 
9. Buffers.  Common walls between residential and non-residential uses shall be constructed to minimize the transmission of noise and vibration. Residential buildings to be constructed or rehabilitated shall be designed to filter out noise and vibration through construction employing, but not limited to, such techniques as applying soundproofing material between dwelling units laterally and vertically, and between different uses; employing staggered joists and insulation. Non-residential uses shall be designed and operated, and hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic or late-night activity. No amplified music shall be audible to neighboring residents. No use abutting residential use shall engage in or cause very loud activities.  Odor, dust, and fumes shall be effectively confined to the origin of its use and so disposed as to avoid air pollution and its dissemination to other uses within the IHOD and other adjacent properties. Where the IHOD abuts a residentially zoned property, a buffer strip equal to the abutting setback requirements shall be required.  


 
10. Storage. Outside storage of recreational vehicles, trailers, pleasure craft and boats shall not be permitted in an IHOD.

The Building Inspector may require the Owner/Developers licensed architect or engineer to inspect all work and to certify its compliance with approved plans. The fees estimated by third party consultants shall be borne by the applicant and shall be due and payable to the Zoning Commission prior to the applicant's filing of an IHOD Final Development Plan or application for an Alteration or Demolition Special Permit. 

2. Performance Security. The developer, either individually or through the general contractor, shall provide to the Commission a project Performance Security Agreement which shall guarantee, to the Commissions satisfaction, the completion of the construction of all improvements necessary to ensure (1) the timely and adequate completion of any site improvements that will be conveyed to or controlled by the Town, and (2) the implementation of any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities.  The Performance Security Agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Commission and approved by the Town Attorney.  Such project security shall take the form of a Bank Deposit Escrow Agreement or a Letter of Credit.  The agreement shall reference the specific project and the construction timeline and provide that the Commission may drawdown on the performance security should the developer fail to complete any site improvements that will be conveyed to or controlled by the Town and/or to implement any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities within the timeline specified by the Commission.  Performance security shall be in an amount equal to the anticipated actual costs for the completion of any site improvements that will be conveyed to or controlled by the Town and/or the implementation of any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities as determined by a writing signed by the developers engineer, accepted by the Commission and confirmed by independent review. Said performance security shall be released upon the developers submittal of evidence that any site improvements that will be 




conveyed to or controlled by the Town and/or the implementation of any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities have been completed, pursuant to the approved plans. 

3. Condominium Agreements.  If the dwelling units within the site are to be in the form of a condominium, the provisions of Section 703  Condominiums shall be applicable. 




 
2.  Quinebaug Regional Technology Park Overlay District (TPOD)  This overlay district is intended to promote economic development, with particular attention to high-technology business, in a different manner from customary industrial development, utilizing the transportation network opportunities offered by the I-395/Kennedy Drive intersection and the readily available nearby utilities relative to certain parcels of land located westerly of Kennedy Drive noted herein, as a community of manufacturing, research and development, and service businesses located together on adjacent or common properties, or connected by a virtual network to other participating companies within the region.  This unconventional method of development is known as Eco-Industrial Development, whereby member businesses seek enhanced environmental, economic, and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, analogous to an ecosystem found in nature. By working together, the community of businesses seeks a collective benefit that is greater than the sum of individual benefits each company would realize by only optimizing its individual performance.  
 
Technology Park Overlay District Regulations 
 
A.   Establishment of the District 
 
The Quinebaug Regional Technology Park Overlay District (TPOD) is hereby established as an overlay district superimposed on the underlying zoning districts as shown on the map entitled Quinebaug Regional Technology Park Overlay District (TPOD), Town of Putnam, Connecticut dated March 2013, with additional detail and information added to said map and dated April 2013.  This map is hereby made a part of these Zoning Regulations and is on file in the Offices of the Town Clerk and of the Zoning Commission.  The TPOD is more specifically described as consisting of all or a portion of the land encompassed within the following Putnam Assessors Tax Parcels as in existence as of March 2013, as so indicated below: 
. Assessors Map 37, Lot 7 (portion) 

. Assessors Map 37, Lot 44 (all) 

. Assessors Map 37, Lot 54 (portion) 

. Assessors Map 44, Lot 1 (portion) 

. Assessors Map 44, Lot 6 (all) 

. Assessors Map 44, Lot 22 (portion) 


All use, dimensional and other requirements of the provisions of these Zoning Regulations governing the underlying zoning districts shall remain in full force and effect, except for a project undergoing development pursuant to this Section.  In the TPOD, regulations for the underlying zoning district(s) may remain in effect for all uses permitted in said underlying district and not otherwise allowed in the 
TPOD.  For projects developed in accordance with this Section, where the provisions of the TPOD are silent on a zoning regulation, the requirements of the underlying zoning district shall apply unless contrary to the intent of the TPOD.   
 
B.   Intention and Goal of the District 
 
The TPOD is intended to promote economic development, with particular attention to high-technology business, in a different manner from customary industrial development, utilizing the transportation network opportunities offered by the I-395/Kennedy Drive intersection and the readily available nearby utilities relative to certain parcels of land located westerly of Kennedy Drive noted above, as a community of manufacturing and service businesses located together on adjacent or common properties, or connected by a virtual network to other participating companies within the region.  This unconventional method of development is known as Eco-Industrial Development, whereby member businesses seek enhanced environmental, economic, and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, analogous to an ecosystem found in nature. By working together, the community of businesses seeks a collective benefit that is greater than the sum of individual benefits each company would realize by only optimizing its individual performance.  
 
The goal of the TPOD is to improve the economic performance of the participating companies by allowing them to share infrastructure as a strategy for enhancing production and minimizing costs while minimizing their environmental impacts. Components of this approach include green design of park infrastructure and plants; cleaner production; pollution prevention; energy efficiency; and inter-company partnering, by coordinating overall park maintenance, working together to follow the principles of natural systems through cycling of resources, working within the constraints of local and global ecosystems, and optimizing energy use.  Thus the TPOD offers firms the opportunity to cooperatively enhance both economic and environmental performance through increased efficiency, waste minimization, innovation and technology development, access to new markets, strategic planning, and attraction of financing and investment.  The TPOD also seeks benefits for neighboring communities to assure that the net regional impact of its development is positive.  Because the TPOD is an area that is environmentally sensitive owing to proximity to the Aquifer Protection Area (APA), uses permitted in the district are intended to provide protection to the quality of the aquifer. 
 
C.  Use Categories within the District  
1. Environmental Business 
The emphasis in the use categories established for the TPOD Overlay District, which shall apply in the zoning district as a matter of right or by special permit in accordance with uses listed in Subsections a., b., and c. below, and more specifically within Table III-1  Schedule of Uses and Districts, is on Environmental Business.   The term Environmental Business refers to those business activities that involve pollution reduction, materials recycling, and alternative or green energy resources research and development, along with the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution of products emanating from these activities.  Environmental business uses involve two distinct, but sometimes related, types of land use. The first denotes process-based enterprises where 
materials are utilized to create a new value-added product, or where processes are directly applied for purposes of environmental remediation. The second denotes uses with an environmental component or components, but not with a primarily process-based orientation. Business uses that have an "environmental component" may include: (1) assembly or manufacturing of pollution reduction equipment, which may be associated with management or testing of air, soil, or water quality, or noise attenuation; and assembly or manufacturing of alternative/renewable energy products (such as solar photovoltaic panels and fuel cells); (2) technical consulting or testing firms in which environmental remediation activity takes place at on-site or off-site locations; and (3) facilities typically required for businesses with an environmental component include office operations, laboratories and equipment storage, and loading areas.   
Uses, and all related site development, shall be subject to site performance and design standards in accordance with Subsection D. of this Section, below, for the TPOD district, including standards for storage, screening and landscaping, site perimeter buffering, and all "nuisance" conditions to be controlled on-site.  
Environmental business uses may include any of the following activities: analytical services (testing and analysis of air, soil, waste, water, chemicals, and similar analytical services); production of consumer and industrial products, such as water saving devices, efficient lighting, packaging made from recycled materials, advanced industrial pumps, and similar products; research and development of energy resources, such as renewable and alternative energies, and other activities associated with alternative energy development; and manufacturing of environmental equipment, such as oceanographic instrumentation, air, soil, and water quality cleanup equipment, noise, and vibration control devices, water pollution reduction equipment, and similar manufacturing.  
The uses defined above as "Environmental Business" should not be construed as limiting the undertaking of office, research and development, and other use types that may have an environmental focus. 
a. Office  

 

Office use type refers to offices, individual firms, or organizations which are primarily used for the provision of executive, management, administrative, financial, or professional services. Offices may be of the corporate, multiple building occupancy, or free-standing type, subject to any further restrictions imposed within individual land uses in the TPOD; and other use classifications when the service rendered is that customarily associated with administrative offices.   





b. Industrial  
Industrial use type refers to on-site production or manufacturing processes.  Proper screening, buffering and site performance standards shall be required.  This use type includes warehousing and distribution facilities that may be associated with production processes and office or research facilities ancillary to the principal use. Industrial uses may include such uses as processing of locally-grown food products and high technology food production, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, manufacturing 
of alternative/renewable energy components including energy-saving controls and devices, manufacturing of energy-efficient controls and devices, and manufacture of materials and products for the green construction industry including assembly of prefabricated building components and uses of the same general type.  
Emerging industrial technologies that have come to the economic front and are projected to emerge as major activities in the future will be emphasized and encouraged. Emerging uses include: manufacturing associated with distributed computing and telecommunications; materials synthesis and processing for advanced structural materials, electronic and photonic materials, and other industrial applications; flexible integrated manufacturing, encompassing such activities as innovative machine concepts, intelligent sensors and process control techniques, computer-based tools for product or process design, manufacturing infrastructure design, and techniques for systems management; assembly or construction of state-of-the-art transportation systems, design and manufacturing of emerging alternative/renewable energy equipment, and pollution reduction and other environmental remediation equipment.  
c.  Research and Development  
Research and development use type refers to the research, development, and prototypical pilot manufacturing or limited production of products designed primarily for initial marketing of electronic, industrial, alternative/renewable energy and fuels (such as solar photovoltaic arrays, heat pumps, and fuel cells), scientific, biotechnological, and biomedical products, and applied process engineering.  Examples of uses include: biotechnology (applied molecular biology); computer-component manufacturers; distributed computing and telecommunications (information technology); transportation research; and other uses intended to create new products or to improve existing ones.  Research and development uses may vary considerably in terms of scale of operations, and may involve the continued development of improved or new products. 
2.  Conference / Cultural Uses  
The conference/cultural use types that shall be applicable in the TPOD overlay zoning district refer to educational, cultural, governmental, recreational, and other uses which are strongly vested with public or social importance.  Uses in this category include hotels with conference space, conference centers, public and private schools engaged in training in technological trades, and social clubs or similar non-profit membership organizations such as Lions, Rotary, YMCA/YWCA, Boys & Girls Club, etc., which support the tenants and employees of the technology park as well as residents of Putnam and the region. 
 
D. Site Plan / Site Performance and Design Guidelines  
 
1. For all uses applicable to the TPOD in accordance with these Regulations, applications shall be accompanied by five (5) copies of a site plan in ink at scale of one (1) inch equal to no more than forty (40) feet.  Such plan shall conform to Class A-2 standards for accuracy in accordance with the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, Connecticut General Statutes Section 20-300b-1 
through 20-300b-20 or as amended. The purpose of a site plan is  to provide the Commission with information that will enable it to determine that the proposed buildings and uses shall be arranged in a manner that enhances the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Putnam and shall be of such character as to harmonize with the neighborhood, to accomplish a transition in character between areas of unlike character, to protect property values in the neighborhood, to preserve and protect natural resources and the appearance and beauty of the community and to avoid undue traffic congestion.   
 
a. Approval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered by the Commission within 65 days after the date of receipt, except that such time period may be extended for not more than one (1) additional period of 65 days, with the consent of the applicant. 
 
b.  A copy of any decision by the Commission on a site plan shall be sent by certified mail to the applicant within fifteen (15) days after such decision is rendered.  
 
2.  Site Plan Content Requirements. Site plans shall be drawn at a scale of at least one inch equals forty feet (1 = 40) and shall be on sheets either 36 x 24 inches or 18 x 12 inches in size and, in addition to the applicable information required for the submission of an application under these Regulations as put forth in Section 113 of these Regulations, site plans submitted under this Section of these Regulations shall clearly show, to the satisfaction of the Commission, the following information: 
 
a. Name and address of applicant; 


 
b. Address of property and name of owner of record; 


 
c. Scale, north arrow, date of drawing or its revision, and name of person preparing the site plan; 


 
d. Property boundaries, dimensions and area; 


 
e. Locations of all existing and proposed buildings and uses including but not limited to signs, sidewalks, driveways, parking and loading areas, and abutting streets; poles, hydrants, and other utility appurtenances; areas to be used for exterior storage and the type of screening to be provided; 


 
f. Dimensions of all yards, as required by these Regulations; 


 
g. Locations and descriptions of water supply and sewage disposal facilities; 


 
h. Contour lines at two foot (2) intervals or at other intervals as may be determined by the Commission to be sufficient to clearly show natural drainage; if grading is proposed, the existing and proposed contours will be shown; 


 
i. Existing and proposed drainage structures on the property and those off the property that may be affected by the proposed building or use.  In order to minimize impact to downstream drainage facilities, increase the environmental quality of stormwater runoff, and to provide for water conservation and increased groundwater recharge measures, Low Impact Development (LID) methods as defined in the latest edition of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, as may be amended from time to time (or its successor), shall be incorporated into the stormwater design;  


 
j. Proposed landscaping, including the type, size and location of proposed plantings;  


 
k. The parking and/or loading space layouts; 


 
l. Location and configuration of all driveways; and 


 
m. Submission of a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 606 of these Regulations. 


 
3.   Putnam Water Pollution Control Authority Review and Certification.  Upon submission of a site plan application, the applicant shall submit a letter or other applicable form of documentation from the Putnam Water Pollution Control Authority (WPCA) which states that the WPCA has reviewed the proposed project use for the site and has certified that there is adequate volume and capacity within the water supply system to supply the project, as proposed, with potable water, and adequate volume and pressure to provide necessary firefighting capability to the project as proposed, in accordance with existing State permits.  In appropriate circumstances the WPCA shall consult with DPH and/or DEEP if the WPCA determines there is a material issue as to capacity.   
 
4. Aquifer Protection Areas.  Where applicable in the TPOD, site development shall be subject to the Town of Putnam Municipal Regulations Aquifer Protection Areas as amended. 




 
5. Site Performance and Design Guidelines  




 
The site plan submitted under this Section shall be designed pursuant to the following Site Performance and Design Guidelines. 
 
a. Newly installed utility services, and service revisions made necessary by exterior alterations, shall be underground. 


 
b. A desirable streetscape and attractive landscape transitions to adjoining properties shall be provided. 


 
c. Existing trees at four (4) inches or greater caliper shall, if possible, remain on the site, and be incorporated into the site plan.  Trees to be planted shall be two inches (2) to two and one-half inches (2 ½) in caliper at the time of planting, the locations of which shall be depicted on the site plan.   


 
d. Utility and service equipment areas shall be screened from public view with materials that are harmonious with the building and site development. 


 
e. Signs shall be designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it principally relates and shall be coordinated with the building architecture and site design. 


 
f. Exterior lighting, where used, shall enhance public safety, the building design, and the landscape.  Said lighting shall be consistent with the recommended standards put forth by the International Dark-Sky Association. 


 
g. No parking or loading areas shall be located within the required front yard setback area, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Commission through a Connecticut registered engineer that such location is not feasible due to on-site conditions. 


 
h. In order to minimize impact to downstream drainage facilities, increase the environmental quality of stormwater runoff, and to provide for water conservation and increased groundwater recharge measures, all stormwater design shall be according to Low Impact Development (LID) methods as defined in the latest edition of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Commission through a Connecticut registered engineer that LID is not feasible nor desirable due to on-site conditions.  Wherever practical, walkways shall be paved with pervious pavers to encourage groundwater recharge.  Impervious pavement should be limited to the minimum area necessary to provide for adequate traffic circulation, and for parking and loading area needs.  Low Impact Development Techniques, where appropriate onsite, may include but are not limited to the following: 


 
i. the use of pervious pavement or grid pavers (which are very compatible for parking lot and fire lane applications), or impervious pavement without curbs or with notched curbs to direct runoff to properly designed and installed infiltration areas; the use of vegetated swales, tree box filters, and/or infiltration islands to infiltrate and treat stormwater runoff (from building roofs and parking lots); 
 
ii. the minimization of access road widths and parking lot areas to the maximum extent possible to reduce the area of impervious surface; 



 
iii. if soil conditions permit, the use of dry wells to manage runoff from the building roofs; 



 
iv. the use of vegetated roofs (green roofs) to reduce the runoff from buildings; 



 
v. proper treatment of special activity areas (e.g. loading docks, covered maintenance and service areas); 



 
vi. the installation of rainwater harvesting systems to capture stormwater from building roofs for the purpose of reuse for irrigation; and 



 
vii. providing for pollution prevention measures to reduce the introduction of pollutants to the environment. 



 
i. Appropriate controls, designed to remove sediment and oil or grease typically found in runoff from parking and driving areas, shall be included in any stormwater collection system to be installed or upgraded.  Non-structural measures to dissipate and treat runoff are strongly encouraged, including infiltration using pervious paving, sheetflow from uncurbed pavement, and vegetated swales.  If a stormwater collection system must be installed, potential controls include gross particle separators, deep sump catch basins with oil-grease traps and/or detention/retention basins.  Any catch basins installed in conjunction with roadway or parking lot paving shall have deep sumps to trap sediments and hoods to trap oil and grease.  If more than one (1) acre of pavement drains to a common discharge point, a gross particle separator shall also be installed, in accordance with advanced designs for said gross particle separators incorporating cyclonic or swirl technology, that the DEEP has approved.  The appropriate variety of this type of unit with a cyclonic design shall be installed in conjunction with each outfall, depending on the size of the drainage area. Provisions shall be made for the periodic maintenance that will be required to insure continued effectiveness of these control measures. 


 
j. Buildings shall be located and oriented on the lot in a manner that best enhances solar gain and provisions for other alternative energy systems such as wind and geothermal energy.  Consequently, buildings and landscaping shall not be constructed in such a manner that excessively shades buildings on adjacent lots or inhibits predominant natural wind currents. 


 
k. The applicant shall utilize landscaping techniques to minimize or eliminate watering requirements.  The applicant is encouraged to install a non-potable well for landscaping requirements and to construct and use storage tanks/cisterns to reduce peak demands on stormwater management systems and potentially to capture rainwater for non-potable irrigation uses. 


 
6. Decision on Site Plan 
 
a. The Commission shall render a decision on any site plan application under this Section within sixty-five (65) days after the receipt of a completed application.  The applicant may consent to one or more extensions of such period, provided the total period of any such extension or extensions shall not exceed two further sixty-five (65) day periods.  No application will be accepted unless it is accompanied by the proper application form or those forms have previously been filed with the Commission.  For the purposes of this Section, the day of receipt of an application or site plan shall be deemed to be the day of 


the Commissions next regularly scheduled meeting immediately following the day of submission of such application to the Commission or its authorized agent, or thirty-five (35) days after such submission, whichever is sooner. 


 
b. The Commission may either deny or approve the application as submitted, modify and approve the application, or approve the application as submitted.  A decision to deny or modify an application shall set forth the reasons for such denial or modification.   


   
 
Section 302  District Boundaries  
 
A. The boundaries of Districts are established as shown on the Official Zoning Map.   


 
1. The Official Zoning Map shall be at a scale of 1 = 1000 and identified by the signature of the Chairman of the Town Zoning Commission, and shall bear the date of the most recent zoning amendment. 


 
2. The boundaries of the Industrial Heritage Overlay District (IHOD) and the Quinebaug Regional Technology Park Overlay District (TPOD) are as established in Section 301, Subsections D.1. and D.2. respectively.   


 
3. When, in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be made on the Official Zoning Map together with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: As amended to (date). (Such date to be that of the most recent amendment.)  The Official Zoning Map shall be filed in the office of the Town Clerk and an updated copy shall be displayed in the Land Use Office. 


 
B. The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the centerline of streets, watercourses, and right of way of power lines, railroads and other public utilities, or such lines extended, or lines parallel thereto.  Where the boundaries of a single district are indicated as including directly opposite sides of a street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right of way or a power line, railroad or other public utility, for any portion of its length, the district so indicated shall be construed to apply to the entire bed of such street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right of way of such power line, railroad, or other public utility lying within such portion of its length.  Where uncertainty exists as to the location of any of said boundaries as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 


 
1. Where district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of a power line, railroad, or other public utility, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. 


 
2. Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following a lot or other property line, such lot or property line shall be construed to be such boundary.  


 
3. Where a district boundary divides a lot or runs through undivided property, the location of such boundary shall be determined by using the scale appearing on said map, unless distances are specified on the map.  


 
4. Where distance are specified on the Map between a street and a district boundary, they shall indicate that the district boundary runs parallel to the street line at a distance therefore equivalent to the number of feet so indicated, unless otherwise specified.  Where scaled distances to not agree with such figure, the figures shall control. 


 
5. Where a District boundary divides a lot in one ownership into two or more residential Districts, the area, frontage, bulk and yard requirements for that lot shall comply with those set forth for the District which comprises a majority of the area of said lot. 


 
6. Where a District boundary divides a lot in one ownership into a residential and a nonresidential District  or into two nonresidential Districts, the area and frontage requirements for that lot shall comply with those that are more restrictive as set forth for such Districts. All other building requirements shall correspond with those of the particular District in which a use, structure or building is established or constructed. 


 
7. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground area at variance with these shown on the Official Map, or in other circumstances not covered by the above subsections, the Commission shall interpret the district boundaries.  


 
 
Section 303  Federal or State Owned Property 
 
Whenever Federal or State owned property is included in one or more zoning districts, it shall be subject to the provisions of those Regulations only insofar as permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America and of the State of Connecticut. 
 
 
Section 304  Schedule of Uses and Districts 
 
Only those items that are specifically permitted by these Zoning Regulations shall be allowed. If a use is not mentioned in these Zoning Regulations, it is not allowed by interpretation. 
 
 
Table III-1  Schedule of Uses and Districts:   
 
. Uses permitted in the zoning district as a matter of right are marked with a P.

Required means of egress structures i.e.: stairs, landings, and covering will be exempt from the setback requirements of Section 401 Table IV-1 Schedule of Dimensional Regulations as applied to existing buildings. 


 
3. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in part unless such structure is made to conform to all of the regulations of the zone in which it is to be located. 


 
4. A nonconforming structure which is damaged by any manner or cause whatsoever in excess of ninety (90) percent of its current market value shall not be repaired or replaced except in conformity with these Regulations. The Agent shall determine the current market value of the damaged structure. In determining this value, only the cost of the structure itself shall be considered. If the extent of damage is less than ninety (90) percent, the structure may be repaired or rebuilt, provided reconstruction shall be started within six (6) months from the date of destruction; the reconstructed structure shall not exceed the height, area or volume of the damaged structure and, an application to rebuild shall be approved by the Commission or its Agent, which shall be subject to the approval of a special permit by the Commission if the footprint of the reconstructed damaged structure is changed. 


 
 
Section 503  Nonconforming Lots 
 
A. Single Nonconforming Lots of Record 


 
A lot having a width or area which is less than required by these Zoning Regulations may be considered buildable for single family residential purposes regardless of the lot width or area, provided such lot was: (1) duly recorded prior to the effective date of these Zoning Regulations; (2) when created, conformed in all respects to the minimum requirements of the Zoning Regulations then in effect; (3) did not adjoin other land of 
the same owner on the effective date of these Zoning Regulations or at anytime after such lot or parcel of land was rendered substandard by the provisions of any prior Zoning Regulations. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as exempting single nonconforming lots of record from complying with the maximum percentage of lot coverage, maximum building heights, minimum building frontage on a Town accepted street, and the minimum building setback requirements. 
 
B. Adjacent Nonconforming Lots of Record Under the Same Ownership 


 
If two or more adjacent nonconforming lots are under the same ownership on the effective date of these Zoning Regulations, such lots shall be considered to be an undivided parcel of land for the purpose of these Zoning Regulations, and no single lot or portion thereof shall be used in violation of the requirements of Section 401 Table IV-1 Schedule of Dimensional Regulations as to lot width and area. If the total lot width or lot area of such adjacent lots of record is less than required by Section 401 Table IV-1 Schedule of Dimensional Regulations, such lots may be considered as a single nonconforming lot of record for single family residential purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as exempting such adjacent nonconforming lots of record from complying with the maximum percentage of lot coverage, maximum building heights, minimum building frontage on a Town accepted street, and minimum building setback requirements for the Zoning District in which such lot is located. Any lots meeting those requirements shall be considered as a conforming lot of record for single family residential purposes. 
 
 
Section 504  Nonconforming Off-Street Parking 
 
A. Existing nonconforming parking spaces. Any off-street parking spaces in existence on the effective date of these Zoning Regulations or thereafter established, which serve a building or use, may not be reduced or increased in number, or changed in location or design contrary to the requirements of Section 601 so as to increase the degree of nonconformity with the requirements of Section 601, except as set forth hereunder.   


 
1.  If the use of an existing structure or lot which does not have sufficient parking, including a use which has no off-street parking, is changed to a different type of use for which a different number of parking spaces is required as set forth in Section 601 and there is no increase in the Gross Leasable Area (GLA), the following rules shall apply: 




 
a. If there is a net increase in the number of required parking spaces, that net increase shall be provided, which number may include any existing parking spaces subject to the requirements of Section 601; and 



 
b. If there is a net decrease in the number of required parking spaces, the number of parking spaces available for future changes of use(s) shall be the number of parking spaces available based on the use(s) of the building immediately prior to the change of use(s) resulting in said net decrease as certified to and approved by the Town Zoning Enforcement Officer in accordance with Section 601. 



 
2.  If the use of an existing structure or lot, which has more than the allowable amount of parking pursuant to Section 601, is changed to a different type of use or is altered or expanded in a way that does not create compliance with Section 601 due to the continued existence of 




excess parking, the excess parking may remain in use but shall not be increased or altered in location or design, unless a special permit allowing the change in use requires the elimination of the excess parking.   




 
a. If it is proposed to increase the net floor area of a building, whether by addition to the exterior of the building or by internal reconstruction, and the building does not have sufficient off-street parking, full compliance with Section 601 for the entire building shall be a condition of the issuance of a building permit for the construction of the increase of net floor area; and 





 
b. An applicant seeking credit for existing parking spaces shall first submit an off-street parking plan, as provided in Section 601, certified by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. If the existing paved area is not marked off into parking spaces or loading bays, such spaces or bays, complying with Section 601 shall be delineated on the plan. To qualify, an existing parking space shall be entirely on the lot. 





 
B. Parking requirements for a building destroyed, damaged or demolished. 
 
1. If a building, for which sufficient off-street parking is not provided, is destroyed, damaged or demolished by the owner, the building may be reconstructed or replaced, if otherwise permitted by these Zoning Regulations, without providing additional parking spaces provided the new use is the same type of use as the use before the destruction, damage or demolition, or is a type of use that requires the same or fewer parking spaces. If parking spaces were provided before the destruction, damage or demolition, at least the same number of spaces shall be provided; and 







 
2. If the new use is a different type of use, for which a greater number of parking spaces is required, or if more net floor area is to be constructed than previously existed, full compliance with Section 601 for the entire building shall be a condition of the issuance of any building permit for the reconstruction or replacement of the building. 







 
C. Repair and Reconstruction 


 
1. Continuance; repairs.  Routine maintenance and repairs are permitted to a nonconforming parking space situation to maintain it in sound condition and presentable appearance. 










 
2. Reconstruction after involuntary destruction (by right).  Any nonconforming parking space situation which is destroyed or damaged by explosion, collapse, fire, storm, natural disaster or other catastrophic event any of which is beyond the control of the owner, may be reconstructed provided there is no increase in the site coverage or the degree of nonconformity and provided that such reconstruction is commenced within one year of such damage or destruction.  










 
 
 
 
Article VI 
Town-Wide Requirements 
 
Section 601  Parking and Loading 
 
A. General  





 
Parking and loading spaces shall be provided off the street for any use of land, buildings or other structures in accordance with the standards hereinafter specified. Off street parking and loading spaces required by this Section shall be permanently maintained and made available for occupancy in connection with and for the full duration of the use of land, buildings and other structures for which such spaces are herein required.  
 
It is the intent of these regulations that all structures and land uses be provided with a sufficient amount of off-street motor vehicle parking, while allowing for some flexibility of site design to accommodate the unique characteristics of individual properties. Additionally, it is the intent of these regulations to promote and support access by bicycle and walking throughout the community.   
 
Further, it is the intent of these regulations to incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) methods as defined n the latest edition of the Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, as may be amended from time to time (or its successor), into the stormwater design for parking and loading areas, in order to minimize impact to downstream drainage facilities, increase the environmental quality of stormwater runoff, and to provide for water conservation and increased groundwater recharge measures.  Parking and loading areas shall be designed to the extent practicable with the goal of no-net runoff from the site. That is, the volume of runoff from the site after development shall not, to the extent practicable, exceed the volume of site run-off prior to the proposed development. In addition, the stormwater management system shall be designed, constructed, and maintained with Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize run-off volumes, prevent flooding, reduce soil erosion, protect water quality, maintain or improve wildlife habitat, and contribute to the aesthetic values of the project.  
 
1. No building shall be erected, substantially altered or its use changed, unless off-street parking and loading spaces have been provided in accordance with these Zoning Regulations.  In the Putnam Downtown (PD) district, on-street parking spaces or public parking lots shall be available for parking for commercial uses within existing buildings if parking is not already provided on-site. 


 
2. A site plan depicting plans and specifications for the required parking, loading facility and access drives shall be submitted at the time of application for the zoning permit for the use, which, where applicable, must be approved by the Commission under Section 113 and where applicable Section 114 of these Regulations.  


 
 
 
B. Existing Uses 
 
Any use already existing shall conform to these standards to the extent that it conforms at the time of the adoption of this Section. If any existing use of land, building or other structure is changed to a use requiring additional off-street parking and loading spaces to comply with this Section, the additional spaces shall be provided for the new use in accordance with the standards hereinafter specified. Any existing use which does not conform to the standards of this Section shall not be changed to a use which would need additional off-street parking and loading spaces to comply with the standards herein unless off-street parking and loading spaces are provided for such new use as required by this Section, except as authorized in Section 601.A.1. 
 
C.  Location  
 
Unless alternative provisions are made elsewhere in these Regulations, all parking facilities required under this Section shall be constructed on the lot containing the main use, or on abutting lot(s) which shall have the same zoning as the main lot.  No parking or loading facility, exclusive of driveways, shall be located within ten (10) feet of a street right-of-way line or five (5) feet of a sidewalk or abutting property line. 
 
D.  Parking Spaces Required 
 
Off-street parking for customers and employees, or residents where applicable, shall be provided and maintained in connection with the intensity of use of buildings or structures. The number of required spaces shall be provided using Table VI-1 in amounts per 1,000 square feet (sf) of Gross Leasable Area (GLA) unless otherwise indicated:

E.   Standards 
 
All off-street parking lots and loading spaces shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the following standards: 
 
1. At least ten percent of the parking lot area shall be landscaped.  Required end islands, interior islands, corner islands, buffer strips between bays of parking and buffer strips adjacent to the building(s) shall apply towards defraying this requirement but perimeter buffer strips shall not. 



 
a. Whenever a parking or loading area is located in or adjacent to a residential district, it shall be effectively screened in accordance with Section 603  Landscaping, of these Zoning Regulations.  In the event that the terrain and other natural features are such that the erection of fences, wall or planting screen required under said Section 603 will not serve the intended purpose, the Commission may grant a special Permit waiving this requirement. 


 
2. All parking and loading facilities required under these Zoning Regulations together with driveways, aisles, and other circulation areas shall be paved with asphalt or other non-permeable equivalent surface.  Where appropriate for seasonal, peak demand parking and to reduce storm water runoff, the use of grass/pavement block or other pervious pavement systems may be permitted. 


 
3. To reduce the mass of parking lots in front of buildings and bring buildings forward, parking should be provided to the side and rear of the building(s) to the extent that is practical. 


 
4. Parking lots shall be separated from the street right-of-way by a landscaped buffer-strip at least 10 feet wide exclusive of sidewalks or utility easements. 


 
5. Parking rows shall be terminated with landscaped end islands of at least 160 square feet in area. 


 
6. Unusable areas between parking rows that meet at an oblique angle shall contain a landscaped corner island. 


 
7. Lighting within the parking area shall be designed in accordance with Section 604 of these Zoning Regulations.   


 
8. Provide at least one tree with a minimum diameter or 2 to 2 ½ for every 10 parking stalls in a parking lot, to be planted within the perimeter of the parking lot. 


 
9. Where required, fire lanes adjacent to buildings shall be 30 feet wide. 


 
10. Dead-end parking bays longer than 25 feet in length, without a means of turning vehicles around, are prohibited. 


 
11. To prevent pedestrian traffic from cutting through adjacent residential properties, the Commission may require walls, fences, or similar architectural elements. 


 
12. Except at loading docks, building entrances and along pedestrian arcades, parking lots and driveways shall be separated from buildings by a landscaped buffer strip containing trees and shrubs. 


 
13. At a minimum, all parking lots shall:  


 
a. Have a minimum stall size of 9 x 18  


 
b. Have rectangular parking stalls  


 
c. Have aisle widths and parking angles in a minimum ratio as shown as follows:

e. Have a number and location of access drives compatible with traffic circulation patterns both within the site and on the abutting street system  


 
f. Provide sufficient stacking area (area where cars may need to wait in line to exit onto the street or to enter to circulate in the parking lot) for 2 vehicles at the outbound access drives from the site  


 
g. Minimize potential conflict points between pedestrians, bicycles, and motor vehicles.  


 
14. When a parking lot extends to a property line, sidewalk or street right-of-way, wheel blocks or other suitable devices shall be installed to prevent any part of a parked vehicle from extending beyond the parking facility setback line. 


 
15. Crosswalks, directional arrows, fire lanes, parking stalls and other pavement features shall be permanently marked on the pavement and supplemented by signs where necessary or required. 


 
16. If shopping carts are provided, shopping cart corrals shall be accessible from every parking bay serving the establishment.  


 
17. Access driveways leading to and from a public street shall be free of parking stalls and separated from parking bays by a landscaped buffer strip. 


 
18. Except for parking spaces provided in connection with a dwelling, each parking space shall be provided with adequate area for approach, turning and exit of an automobile having an overall length of 20 feet without need to use any part of a public street right-of-way. 


 
19. Points of entrance and exit for driveways onto the street shall be located so as to minimize hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the street.  No off-street loading space and no truck loading bay, ramp or dock shall be designed or arranged in a manner that trucks must use any part of a public street right-of-way for maneuvering, or for loading and unloading. 


 
20. All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper drainage of surface water in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations of the Town and as further required in Sections 601 and 113, and, where applicable, Section 114 of these Regulations.  
 
21. All commercial, industrial and multi-family residential uses shall provide trash and/or garbage collection areas enclosed on all four (4) sides by a solid wall or an opaque fence of at least five (5) feet in height, with a locking gate, if such area is not within an enclosed building or structure.  Provision for adequate vehicular access to and from such area or areas for collection of trash and/or garbage shall be required. 


 
22. Access driveways serving any required parking lots as a direct access drive from a street shall not be less than twelve (12) feet three (3) inches or more than sixteen (16) feet for one-way traffic (parking spaces angled at 70 degrees or less only), and not less than twenty-four (24) feet or more than thirty (30) feet for two-way traffic. 


 
F.   Loading Space Requirements and Dimensions 
 
1.  No land shall be used or occupied and no structure shall be erected or used for commercial or industrial purposes unless the off-street loading spaces required herein are provided.  Off-street loading spaces as specified in these Zoning Regulations shall be provided for any 





enlargement or alterations to any such existing structure or use.  In the Putnam Downtown (PD) district, off-street loading spaces shall not be required for uses within existing buildings if such loading spaces are not already provided on-site.  





 
2.  Off-street loading spaces shall be on the same or contiguous lot or parcel of land as the use or structure they are intended to serve.  In no case shall any required off-street loading space be part of an area to satisfy the off-street parking requirements.  Such space shall be located in the rear of the building. 





 
3.  A loading space shall have minimum dimensions of not less than twelve (12) feet in width, sixty (60) feet in length, exclusive of driveways, aisles, and other circulation areas, and a clearance of height of not less than fourteen (14) feet.  Off-Street loading spaces shall be provided as follows:

4.  All off-street loading spaces shall be located so as not to impede the flow of traffic within the parking area.  A site plan depicting the plans for off-street loading shall be submitted at the time of application for the zoning permit for the use, which, where applicable, must be reviewed and approved by the Commission under Section 113 and, where applicable, Section 114 of these Regulations.  
 
G.  Shared Parking  
 
1.  The Commission may consider written agreements for shared off-site parking proximate to the site provided the applicant satisfies the Commission that the agreement is legally enforceable and of sufficient duration to avoid future problems. The applicant should also provide a viable long term alternate solution if the agreement to provide off-site parking is not permanent in nature.  








 
2.  The Commission may also consider a written on-site shared parking arrangement that allows a reduction in the number of required on-site parking spaces such that the peak usage periods of the various uses on the site will not occur simultaneously.  A request for such a shared parking agreement, prepared by a registered traffic engineer, shall be submitted in narrative form, and shall be graphically depicted on a separate plan sheet, which shall demonstrate the specifics of the request and the justification for shared parking for the particular project. 








 
3.  Any such shared parking agreements shall be approved by the Commission and shall be recorded in the Land Evidence Records of the Town.  








 
H.  Bicycle and Pedestrian Accommodations  
 
1.  It is the intent of this Section to promote and support access by bicycle and walking throughout the community. To this end, all parking lots must be designed to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access as a part of any parking lot design including safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle movement to and from public walkways and/or bikeways, streets, or transit stops.  





 
2.  Design Standards: 





  
a.  A minimum of one bicycle parking space shall be provided for each 40 off-street automobile parking spaces.  Parking lots of less than 40 parking spaces shall be provided with at least one bicycle parking space.  Within the PD district this bicycle parking requirement may be met within the public parking lots. 


 
b.  At a minimum, all bicycle parking spaces shall be provided in the form of bicycle racks with locking capability.  


 
c.  All pedestrian walkways shall be constructed to provide for: 


 
i.  safe separation of all walkways from motor vehicle traffic through the use of raised sidewalks and/or landscaping between sidewalks and parking spaces and/or driving aisles; 







 
ii.  safe, well-articulated pedestrian crossings demarcated with pavement markings, pedestrian warning signs, and lighting; 







 
iii.  a minimum of 4 feet in width; and 







 
iv.  inclusion of plantings, benches, and lighting along walkways and at all pedestrian crossings.  







 
Design, construction, and maintenance to accommodate disabled individuals shall be provided per Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. 
 
I.  Waivers and Permits  
 
1.  Except for buildings or parts of buildings used or occupied for residential use, all or part of the off-street parking requirements may be waived by the Commission where the proposed site planning, design, and construction includes one or all of the following as deemed appropriate by the Commission:  
 
a.  sufficient publicly owned parking spaces within 500 feet of the proposed development site; 









 
b.  access to a regularly scheduled transit stop within 500 feet of the proposed development, with service available during commuting hours;  









 
c.  direct access from a bikeway to the proposed development; and  









 
d.  provision of a regularly scheduled, municipally supported shuttle bus service from the development to an alternate safe, secure, and convenient parking facility. 









 
The Commission may require the submission of a parking demand analysis as part of any request for a waiver or Permit from the general parking requirements.   
 
2.  In the case that an applicant believes that the required parking amounts are in excess of what is needed for the proposed use, the applicant may submit a request with justification to the Commission for a reduction in parking space requirements. The Commission will consider and act on this request concurrent with and as part of the full development application process.   





 
3.  The Commission may approve parking lots with more spaces than the allowed maximum provided all of the spaces above the maximum number are composed of a pervious surface, and where adequate stormwater management is provided as specified in this Section and Section 113 and, where applicable, Section 114 of these regulations.  The Commission may also approve parking lots with additional impervious parking spaces above the allowed maximum spaces where the use of pervious spaces would not be environmentally sound and where a stormwater management plan is included with the application and implemented, employing, at a minimum, the stormwater management measures specified in this Section and Section 113 and, where applicable, Section 114 of these regulations.  





 
 
Section 602  Signs 
 
A.  Purpose 
 
It is the purpose and intent of this Section to accommodate the establishment of signs necessary for identification, direction and reasonable commercial promotion while avoiding signs of a character, as well as a proliferation and extension of signs, that would be detrimental to the public health and safety, property values and the appearance and beauty of the community.  
 
1. A sign permit, issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, shall be required for all signs hereafter erected, installed, or replaced unless specifically exempted by these Regulations.  Any sign erected without a sign permit shall constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of Section 110 of these Regulations. 


 
2. All signs shall conform to the provisions hereinafter specified and to any additional conditions or limitations that may be imposed by the Commission in connection with the approval of a Site Plan or Special Permit. 


 
B.  Application for a Sign Permit 
 
1.   Application for a sign permit shall be made to the Zoning Enforcement Officer on a form provided by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and shall be accompanied by a filing fee. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the permit request within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete submission. 








 
2.  The following information shall be provided with the application for a sign permit:  








 
a.  the size of the proposed sign, including area, height, width, thickness, illumination and material of which it is to be constructed; 









 
b.  a detailed drawing showing the construction details of the sign, position of lighting or other extraneous devices, and support structure; and 









 
c.  a plot plan showing the location of the sign in relation to the building and all property lines and streets. 









 
d.  The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require additional information or specify the location of the sign on the lot for safety purposes. 









 
3. Except for temporary signs installed under the provisions of Section 602.F.4., the permit for a temporary sign shall be valid for no more than thirty (30) days and shall not be extended.  The sign must be removed at the expiration of the permit period.  


 
4. No permit shall be required for a mere change of copy on a sign, the customary use of which involves frequent and periodic changes of copy. 


 
C.  General Conditions 
 
1. In all districts permitted signs may be erected, altered, maintained, used, removed, or moved, only in compliance with the provisions of this Section and other regulations of the Town relating to the erection, alteration, maintenance, use, removal, or moving of signs and similar devices.  


 
2. Existing signs at the time of passage of these Zoning Regulations that do not conform to the requirements of these Zoning Regulations shall be considered nonconforming signs and once removed shall be replaced only with conforming signs; however, nonconforming signs may be repainted or repaired (including lighting) provided such repainted or repaired sign does not exceed the dimensions of the existing sign.

The required front yard or side yard along a street of all lots shall be landscaped and surfaced either with lawn, evergreen ground cover or suitable substitute, except for driveways, walkways, bikeways, or similar uses.  In commercial and industrial uses in which parking is located within the required front yard, this landscaped area shall be at least 10 in width. 


 
2. One or more driveways may run perpendicular  approximations expected  to the required landscaped yard setback, except that the Commission may approve the location of a connecting driveway between separate parcels within this yard. In the case of a single family 


home a turnaround area, circular driveway or area immediately adjacent to the driveway for no more than three cars may be placed in this required front yard setback. No motor vehicles shall be parked or stored on landscaped surfaces within such yard. No motor vehicles shall be parked or stored in the required front yard on a second driveway of a single family home. 


 
3. Any lot developed for commercial or industrial use shall provide a minimum 10 landscaped area along side and rear lot lines, except for areas in which common driveways, walkways, bikeways, or similar uses are located, or, sites that consist of shared lot areas developed in tandem and so approved by the Board pursuant to Section 601 and Section 113 and, where applicable, Section 114. 


 
4. Adjacent Residential Property:  There shall be a buffer zone of at least twenty-five (25) feet between a lot with a proposed non-residential use or building and adjacent lots in a residential district. For all non-residential uses located immediately abutting to or within a residential zone, the owner of the non-residential use shall provide a buffer zone on the property line between these two uses.  Said buffer zone/strip shall be properly landscaped and planted with evergreen trees and/or shrubbery of no less than six (6) feet in height.  Planting shall be done and maintained in such a manner so as to provide year-round screening.  The required buffer may be provided by existing vegetation.  


 
a. Buffer zone areas that contain some natural growth but insufficient to provide a proper screen shall be planted with drought-resistant, non-Invasive tree and shrub species.  At least sixty percent (60%) of the plantings shall be evergreen species, and at least fifty percent (50%) of the evergreen shall be spruce or have the equivalent foliage. Evergreen trees shall be not less than six (6) feet tall and shall be planted not more than seven (7) feet apart. 


 
b. Buffer zone areas that contain little or no natural growth shall provide two (2) planted areas of trees parallel to the residential district zone line.  The spaces between the trees in one area shall be centered upon a tree in the other area.  The first planting area shall begin seven (7) feet from the residential district zone line.  Trees spaced as aforementioned may be planted anywhere within said area.  Plantings shall consist of drought-resistant, non-invasive tree and shrub species with at least sixty percent (60%) evergreen species, of which at least fifty percent (50%) shall be spruce or have the equivalent foliage.  The second planting area shall begin sixteen (16) feet from the residential district zone line.  Trees spaced as aforementioned may be planted anywhere within said area but must be spaced properly from any staggered planting in the first planting area Planting shall consist of sixty percent (60%) evergreen species, of which at least fifty percent (50%) shall be spruce or have the equivalent foliage. 


 
c. In that area of the buffer zone where the planting of trees is not required, there shall be proper ground coverage to prevent the blowing of dust, dirt or refuse, and to prevent soil erosion.  Wood chips or their equivalent shall not be used as a substitute for proper plantings in the buffer zone area. Any trees, shrubs or grasses that die or become diseased and cannot be restored to their screening function, shall be replaced. 


 
 
d. Buffer zones may also include a screened fence for the purpose of stopping debris from non-residential uses from entering the residence districts and to further screen the view. Any debris accumulating in the buffer zone shall be removed every thirty (30) days. The fence 


shall be approximately parallel to the residential district zone line, of good workmanship, and properly maintained and no signs shall be posted upon the side of the fence facing the residential district except as outlined in Section 602 of these Zoning Regulations. 


 
e. In approving a site plan, the Commission may modify, at the applicant's request, the requirements of this Subsection with respect to buffer zones, provided that such modifications are in keeping with the intent of this Section and provide adequate screening for residential uses involved, prevent the blowing of dust, dirt, and refuse, and prevent soil erosion.

Section 604  Lighting  
 
A. Purpose 
 
1.  This Section is intended to minimize the problems caused by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. 





 
2.  Improperly designed outdoor lighting can cause glare, defined as light emitted with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see and, in extreme cases, causing momentary blindness. Glare can create a nuisance or hazard for users of neighboring properties and for motorists or pedestrians on public streets. In addition, light that crosses a property boundary, particularly from a nonresidential to a residential property, can cause a nuisance by reducing nighttime privacy. These requirements are adopted to minimize glare from outdoor lighting and reduce the spillover of light beyond the area for which it is intended. 





 
B.  Applicability 
 
 The requirements of this Section apply to lighting in residential and non-residential districts, not including lighting of public streets. 
 
C.   Allowed Outdoor Lighting 
 
1.  Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be so arranged as to direct the light down, towards the parking area, and away from the adjoining lots in residential districts and any public street right-of-way.  





 
2.  Outdoor lighting shall be limited to the following types of fixtures. In these requirements, the term lamp refers to the component of the light fixture that produces the light. 





 
a.  Shielded Lights  Relative to  spotlights and low intensity lights as defined below, all light fixtures shall be fully or partially shielded.

Section 705  Open Space Residential Development Subdivisions  
 
Open Space Residential Development (OSRD) subdivisions in accordance with these Regulations shall be encouraged within the town for all single-family residential subdivisions greater than four lots in the R-40 and AG-2 zoning districts. Open Space Residential Development shall mean a single-family residential subdivision in which the dwelling units are grouped together on reduced building lot areas, adjacent to permanently preserved open space. An Open Space Residential Development subdivision shall be the preferred method of subdivision development within the R-40 and AG-2 zoning districts wherever the following purposes would be served. 
 
A. Purpose and Applicability 
 
These regulations are intended to provide for increased flexibility, balanced by increased control, in the development of land so as to facilitate the preservation of open space, natural resources, recreational uses, and community character.  
 
1. The purposes of this Section are to: 


 
a. promote conservation of soils, wetlands, streams, large and healthy stands of trees, existing farmland, stone walls, and other significant natural and cultural features and landmarks, making the best use of the land through avoidance of unnecessary  regrading of the natural terrain; 


 
b. enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, greenways, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces; 


 
c. enhance public recreation opportunities, including access to greenway networks and trails; 


 
d. encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural lands, forest lands and other natural resources including aquifers, water bodies and wetlands, and historical and archaeological resources; 


 
e. encourage a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; 


 
f. maintain the traditional New England rural character and land use pattern in which small villages contrast with open space and farmlands; 


 
g. facilitate the construction of streets, utilities and public services in a more economical and efficient manner; 


 
h. ensure that residential developments are designed to minimize impacts to the natural features of the land, including wetlands, watercourses, forests, prime agricultural land, steep slopes, plants, wildlife, historically and culturally significant sites, scenic views, and rural character; 


 
i. encourage development out of view from the road, and promote alternatives to strip residential development lining roadsides in the town; and  


 
j. provide wildlife corridors connecting open spaces, needed by wildlife to ensure their survival. 


 
2. Applicability.  Any applicant applying for a single-family residential subdivision located in the R-40 and AG-2 districts, creating four or more building lots, shall apply for an OSRD subdivision under these Zoning Regulations, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that a conventional single-family residential subdivision would better serve the purposes of this Section of the Regulation in the particular case.  
 
B.  General Density Limitations  
 
Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations, the overall density of an OSRD subdivision shall be no greater than what would be allowed in the district under conventional zoning.  The maximum number of units for an OSRD subdivision shall be determined by the Yield Plan Method, as follows.  
 
1. Under the Yield Plan Method, the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations governing conventional subdivision lots.  Although such yield plans shall be conceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs, they must be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout. Consequently, yield plans must identify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development, including, but not limited to, topographic contours, at a contour interval of no less than ten (10) feet; wetlands and watercourses; 100-year floodplains (Flood Zones A, as shown on FEMA maps); slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%); rock outcrops; and easements and rights-of-way affecting the parcel.  On lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility, soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated. The Planning Commission may select a small percentage of lots (10 to 15%) to be tested, in areas considered to be marginal. If all tests on the sample lots meet applicable Public Health Code requirements, the applicant's other lots shall also be deemed suitable for septic systems, for the purpose of calculating total lot yield. However, if any of the sample lots fail, several others (of the Planning Commissions choosing) shall be tested, until all the lots in a given sample pass. 
 
C.  Density Bonuses  
 
 The maximum number of lots allowed under this Section and/or under Section 401 may be increased in one of the following ways:  
 
1.  Open Space Maintenance Fund. The Planning Commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. The density bonus granted under this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under this Section and/or under Section 401 as may be applicable. Any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcel to be subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either (1) the Town of Putnam or (2) the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan. The amount of the fee shall be set by the following formula: [(CFMV/N) x (0.5 XL)], where CFMV is the cumulative fair market value of all of the buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, N is the total number of buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, and XL is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus. The value of CFMV shall, at the option of the applicant, be (1) the 100% value of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the Town Assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision approval, or (2) determined by a licensed Connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the Planning Commission, in which case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees. 





 
2.  Other Open Space Dedications. A density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space, meaning the amount of any open space acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this Section. The additional open space may be within the parcel to be subdivided or elsewhere within the Town of Putnam. For each five acres of excess open space accepted by the Planning Commission, one additional building lot shall be allowed, up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under this Section and/or under Section 401 as may be applicable. The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer 





to dedicate excess open space shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the Town's Plan of Conservation and Development and its determination as to the value of the excess land for any of the purposes described in this Section. 





 
D. Open Space Percentage and Use Limitations  
1. Minimum Percentage of Open Space. The minimum area of open space to be dedicated within an OSRD subdivision shall be forty percent (40%) of the total area of the parcel being subdivided. In addition, the area of open space to be dedicated must contain at least forty percent (40%) of the total area of the parcel that does not comprise wetlands, watercourses, floodplain areas, or slopes in excess of twenty-five percent (25%). As an example, if a parcel containing 100 acres is subdivided, and 30 acres of the parcel consists of wetlands, watercourses, floodplain areas, or slopes in excess of twenty-five percent (25%, the minimum open-space dedication will be 40 acres (100 acres x .40), and at least 28 acres (70 acres x .40) of the dedicated area must not be wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a subdivider from dedicating additional land consisting of wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas, so long as the minimum amount of other types of land is also provided. For instance, in the example given above, the subdivider could dedicate 20 acres (not just 12 acres) of wetlands, so long as the dedication also included the minimum 28 acres of land that did not consist of wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. The Planning Commission encourages subdividers to dedicate or otherwise preserve as much of the wetlands, watercourses and floodplain areas as possible.  
2.  Use of Open Space Areas. The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant. The required open space may be used, without restriction, for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems, provided that no portion of such systems protrudes above grade. Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space, as may land within the rights-of-way for underground utility lines. However, land within the rights-of way of overhead power lines or other surface utility lines shall not be included in the minimum required open space.  
 
E.  Design Standards  
 
 1. Dimensional Requirements. The dimensional requirements for building lots in an OSRD subdivision shall be as follows:  
. Minimum Lot Area: 25,000 square feet AG-2 District, 15,000 square feet R-40 District  

. Minimum Lot Frontage: 100 feet (25 feet for rear lots) 

. Minimum Front Yard: 40 feet 

. Minimum Side Yard: 20 feet  

. Minimum Rear Yard: 40 feet  

. Maximum Lot Coverage: 15%  

. Rear lots shall contain no less than 35,000 square feet, excluding the area of the accessway, and shall have a minimum driveway access width of twenty-five (25') feet.  


. All lots in an OSRD subdivision shall comply with the minimum buildable area requirements set forth in this Section except where the lot(s) is/are to be served by a community septic system in conformance with all Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and State Public Health Code regulations and requirements. 


 
2. Other Design Standards. In designing an OSRD subdivision, the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in this Section of these regulations and the following factors:  
 
a. Dwelling units shall be grouped allowing a portion of the parcel to remain open.  


 
b. The open space in any OSRD subdivision shall be located entirely within the subdivision and shall be in one contiguous piece, unless the Planning Commission finds that the purposes of this Section of these regulations would be more effectively served by separated parcels. The open space shall have suitable shape, dimension, character and location to promote the purposes specified in this Section of these regulations. 


 
c. When designing an OSRD subdivision the applicant must refer to the Town's Open Space Plan and plan the development in relation to the open space by first (1) locating the proposed open space; second, locating houses; third, locating roads; and, fourth, laying out lot configurations. 


 
d. Lots shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives (listed below in order of priority, as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site):  


 
i. to place septic systems on the most suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal (in unsewered areas only); 


 
ii. within any woodland contained in the parcel, or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland (to reduce impact upon agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind, and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features);  


 
iii. in locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadway(s);  


 
iv. on the least fertile soils for agricultural uses, and in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use; and 


 
v. in locations where the greatest number of units could be designed to take maximum advantage of solar heating opportunities.  


 
e. Wherever possible, wetlands should be adjacent, contiguous or included in the Open Space.  


 
f. Underground utilities shall be required in OSRD subdivisions.  


 
g. Proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved, including, but not limited to, stone walls.  


 
h. Proposed open space areas should include irreplaceable natural features located in the tract (such as, but not limited to stream beds, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, and rock outcroppings).  


 
i. Open space intended for recreation or other active public use should be easily accessible to pedestrians, including, to the extent feasible, the handicapped and elderly.  


 
j. Individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites, and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel.  


 
3.  The Planning Commission may require the subdivider to refer any proposed OSRD subdivision to a professional landscape architect for review, comment and modification. The Planning Commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed, if it determines that such modified location(s) will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these Regulations, and of the Subdivision Regulations as recommended by the Planning Commission. In making such determination, the Planning Commission may also consider: 
 
a. the ownership of any existing open space on adjacent properties, or the proximity to non-adjacent open space which might reasonably interconnect with the proposed open space in the future; 


 
b. the proposed use of the open space for active or passive uses, and the extent of maintenance, supervision, or management required; 


 
c. the potential benefits which the open space might provide to residents of the Town or the State, if it were accessible to them; 


 
d. the size shape, topography, and character of the open space;  


 
e. the recommendations of the Putnam Plan of Conservation and Development and the Putnam Open Space Plan; and  


 
f. the reports or recommendations of any State, regional or Town agencies and officials.  


 
F.  Dedication of Open Space

Section 712  Wireless Communication 
 
A.  Purpose 
 
To provide for the location of wireless communication towers, antennas and facilities while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing adverse visual and operational effects through careful design, siting and screening consistent with the provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  This Section of the Zoning Regulations is consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in that it does not discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services, or regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations (FCC regulations) concerning such emissions.  Other specific wireless telecommunication purposes are as follows: 
 
1. To encourage use of nonresidential buildings and structures, such as water storage tanks.  


 
2. To require joint use of new or existing towers and facilities whenever possible. 


 
3. To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of towers. 


 
4. To accommodate the need for wireless communication towers and antennas while regulating their location and number.  


 
5. To protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of wireless communication facilities. 


 
6. To encourage suitable design measures to minimize adverse visual effects of wireless communication facilities.  


 
7. To reduce the number of towers and/or antennas needed in the future. 


 
B.  Definitions 
 
For the purposes of this Section, the following words shall have the following definitions: 
 
Antenna is to be defined as a device used to receive or transmit electromagnetic waves.  Examples include, but are not limited to whip, panel and dish antenna. 
 
Telecommunications tower is defined as a structure that is intended solely to support equipment used to receive and/or transmit electromagnetic waves.  Design examples of towers include, but are not limited to, self-supporting lattice, guide (guy-wire) and monopole. 
 
Wireless telecommunication facility includes the equipment and structures involved in receiving or transmitting electromagnetic waves associated with wireless telecommunication services, together with all cabinets, buildings, transformers and associated structures.  
 
Wireless telecommunication services are services associated with the transmission and/or reception of wireless telecommunications.  These services may include by way of example, but not limited to, cellular personal communications, specialized, mobilized, radio and paging.  
 
C.  Siting Preferences 
 
 The general order of preference for alternative facility locations shall range from A as the most preferred to E as the least preferred: 
 
1. On existing or approved towers. 


 
2. On existing structures such as nonresidential buildings/facades, water towers/tanks, utility poles, chimneys, bridges, grain elevators, and silos, or in structures such as steeples, clock and bell towers. 


 
3. On new towers located on property occupied by one or more existing towers. This recognizes an already proven good site, and implies that clustering or tower farming is more desirable than scattering or dispersal.  However, with lower power PCS, which can require more antennas for coverage, clustering may not necessarily provide seamless coverage.  


 
4. On new towers located in commercial or industrial zones. 


 
5. On new towers located in residential zones by special permit.  


 
D.  General Standards 
 
1. The wireless telecommunication facility standards enumerated below shall be followed: 


 
a.  The tower and/or antenna shall be erected to the minimum height necessary to satisfy the technical requirements of the telecommunications facility except as stated in 4.a.1 Documentation of the minimum height needed, prepared by a licensed telecommunication systems engineer, shall accompany an application.  The Commission may require the submission of propagation modeling results to facilitate its review of tower height. 



 
2.  In all residential and agricultural zones, accessory structures such as radio and television transmission relay or receiving, wireless telecommunication towers and/or antennas shall be allowed provided that the resulting total height (including support structures) is not greater than the maximum allowable building height measured from ground level, and provided that the height of the structure is less than its distance from any property line.  Structures more than the maximum allowable building height, but less than 100 feet above existing mean 
grade adjacent to the base of the facility may be allowed by Special Permit provided that the minimum site size shall be the minimum lot size required for a zoning district, and the site shall be of sufficient size to accommodate a setback from all adjoining property lines equal to the maximum height of the tower and all appendages plus twenty five (25) feet, or the provisions of Subsection E.1.b. of this Section, following, whichever is greater. 
 
a. A tower must comply with the setback requirements of the zone in which it is located, or be set back from all property lines a distance equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the height of the tower, whichever is greater.  


 
b. A telecommunication facility may be considered as either a principal or accessory use in an industrial or commercial zone, or as a principal use in a residential or agricultural zone.  The minimum lot area for the construction of a new tower shall be that of the zone in which it is located.  More than one tower on a lot may be permitted if all setbacks, design, and landscape requirements are met for each tower.  A telecommunications facility may be located on leased land as long as there is adequate ingress and egress to the site for service vehicles, and such access is documented in a formal written lease which would run for either the estimated useful life of the improvements, or provide for a mechanism satisfactory to the Commission for removal of all improvements at the termination of the lease.  The formal notice of lease shall be filed in the land records of the Town, and the lease shall provide the name of the individual or entity responsible for responding to emergency conditions, which information shall be continuously updated by the lessee and filed with the Town of Putnam Building Department on an ongoing basis. 


 
c. All towers in a residential zone shall be a monopole design unless a design which is less intrusive on the existing neighborhood is approved by the Commission.  The Commission may approve an alternate design if the Commission finds it s more in keeping with the existing neighborhood and less likely to affect property values, aesthetics and safety. 


 
d. Towers not requiring Federal Aeronautics Administration (FAA) painting or markings shall be painted a non-contrasting blue, gray, or other neutral color. 


 
e. No lights or illumination shall be permitted unless required by the FAA. 


 
f. No signs or advertising shall be permitted on any tower or antenna, except that no trespassing, warning, and ownership signs are permitted at ground level or no higher than seven (7) feet from ground level. 


 
g. The proposed support structure shall be required to accommodate a minimum of three users unless it is determined to be technically unfeasible based upon information submitted by the applicant and verified by the Commission.  These users shall include other wireless communication companies, local police, fire, and ambulance companies. 


 
h. A proposed tower shall be designed and constructed to all applicable standards of the American National Standards Institutes (ANSI), as amended. 


 
i. The Commission may require the use of Section 16-50aa of the Connecticut General Statutes to promote tower sharing if the Commission finds that such sharing shall lessen the overall impact of the proposed facility on the Town. 


 
j. Any telecommunication tower or telecommunications antenna located in a general business, highway commercial, downtown commercial or industrial zone, shall be a Special Permit rather than permitted use if the actual tower shall be located within three hundred (300) feet of any agricultural or residential use zone.

TOWN OF PUTNAM SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
- 2 -
Section 101 - Policy - It is declared to be the policy of the Town of Putnam P1anning Commission that the subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivision is subject to the control of the Town pursuant to State Statutes and the Plan of Conservation and Development.

Land shall not be subdivided until proper provision has been made for drainage, water, sewerage, recreation or open space improvements, and traffic and circulation systems.
The existing and proposed improvements shall conform to and be properly related to the proposals shown in the Plan of Conservation and Development. It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the administration of the provisions and standards contained in the building code, Zoning Regulations and Plan of Conservation and Development.
Section 102 - Adoption - By authority of the Planning Commission of the Town of Putnam, adopted pursuant to the powers and jurisdictions vested through the provisions of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, as amended, and other applicable laws, the Planning Commission does hereby adopt these regulations and any amendments thereto, and exercises the power and authority to review, approve, modify and approve, and disapproved plans for subdivision or resubdivision of land within the Town which show lots, blocks or sites with or without new streets or highways.

B. Conflict - All sections or portions of sections of the Subdivision Regulations heretofore in effect which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations are hereby repealed. Wherever the terms of the Subdivision Regulations require a higher standard of development than is required in any other statute, local ordinance or regulations, the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations shall govern.

C.

If State statute or State or local governmental regulations requires a higher standard than contained in these subdivision regulations, the higher standard shall prevail and be deemed to be required by these regulations.

Section 110  Open Space Residential Development (OSRD)
A. Definition and Purpose. For the purposes of these regulations, the term "conventional subdivision" refers to a subdivision conforming to the base requirements for zoning districts as stated in Section 401 of the Town of Putnam Zoning Regulations. The term "Open Space Residential Development (OSRD)" refers to subdivisions in the AG-2 and R-40 zoning districts conforming to the requirements and purposes of Section 705 of the Town of Putnam Zoning Regulations as amended.
B. Considerations. Effective July 17, 2014, Section 705.A.2. of the Putnam Zoning Regulations states:
Any applicant applying for a single-family residential subdivision located in the R-40 and AG-2 districts, creating four or more building lots, shall apply for an OSRD subdivision under these Regulations, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Planning Commission that a conventional single-family residential subdivision would better serve the purposes of this Section of these Regulations in the particular case.
In determining whether or not to allow a conventional subdivision, rather than an OSRD subdivision, the Commission shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria:
? Size of the proposed subdivision;
? The Town of Putnam Plan of Conservation and Development;
? The presence of any existing open spaces, recreation areas, and/or land for other public purposes in the vicinity;
? The need for buffer areas between incompatible land uses;
? Protection of flood plains, wetlands, and watercourses;
? Conservation of natural features as scenic vistas, ridge tops, rock outcroppings, waterfalls, etc.;
? Protection of significant habitats for plant and animal species; and
? Linkages connecting open spaces; and
? Any other of the purposes of an OSRD subdivision referred to in Section 705.A.1. of the Town of Putnam Zoning Regulations as amended.
C. Procedures for Approval
Except as otherwise provided in this Section and/or in Section 705 of the Town of Putnam Zoning Regulations as amended, all OSRD subdivision plans and applications must meet the procedural and substantive requirements of these Subdivision Regulations as determined by the Planning Commission and of the Town of Putnam Zoning Regulations.
Section 111  Enforcement - Any person, firm or corporation making any subdivision of land without the approval of the Commission shall be subject to a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each lot sold or offered for sale or so subdivided. Each day any provision of the Subdivision Regulations is violated shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
TOWN OF PUTNAM SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS

Any subdivision of land in violation of the terms of these Regulations is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission, or its agent, to enforce these Regulations and to advise the Town attorney of any violations.

A. General Requirements - if a public water supply is within 200 feet of a subdivision boundary, measured along a street, alley or easement, the water supply lines shall be extended to serve the subdivision and connected to the subdivision. The cost of extending this line will be borne by the developer, under the supervision of the Water Pollution Control Authority. Upon completion of the extension, the line shall become the property of the Water Pollution Control Authority. Application for water line extensions shall be made through the Water Pollution Control Authority office and will be contingent upon approval of the developer's plans and specifications. When a public water supply is more than 200 feet from the subdivision boundary, the Commission may require a water system, subject to the approval of the Fire Marshal, capable of providing fire protection if it finds that the size of the proposed development requires such a water system to insure the public health and safety.
Water supply facilities design shall be in conformance with the Water Pollution Control Authority's design criteria and engineering requirements. All water supply facilities shall be compatible with the long range planning for water supply within the Town.
B. Fire Hydrants - Where public water is available or required, fire hydrants may be required where necessary to insure the public health and safety. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 500 feet apart in residential areas and no more than 300 feet apart in commercial/industrial areas, and shall be approved by the Water Pollution Control Authority. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements, shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plan.

Town of Putnam Municipal Regulations
Aquifer Protection Areas
SECTION 1. Title and Authority
(a) Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for
the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and
opportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost ofland and
increasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have
been contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address
this problem, Connecticut has established the Aquifer Protection Area Program
(Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply
aquifers and to protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires
coordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and water companies to ensure
a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations. Itis therefore
the purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the Town of
Putnam by making provisions for:
(1) implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning
Aquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb

watercourse areas maps;

certain new activities; registering existing regulated activities; 'and issuing permits for
new regulated activities at registered facilities; and
(4) administering and enforcing these regulations.
(b) These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the nAPA
Regulations") of the Town of Putnam .
.(c) These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance
with the provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the
Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut
State Agencies §22a-354i-1 through §22a-354i-10.
(d) The Zoning Commission of the Town of Putnam is established as the Aquifer Protection
Agency (the "Agency") in accordance with the "Ordinance for the Establishment of an
Aquifer Protection Agency," (the "APA Ordinance") effective March 12, 2009, and shall
implement the purposes and provisions of the AP A Ordinance and the Act.
(e) The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or deny c

Section I
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed.
The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply
of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to
the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal,
aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in
danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of
material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of
which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated
activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and
benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the
wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses,
disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety
of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of
the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland
wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and
improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other
beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats
thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of
wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other
public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the
dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly
process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the
need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state,
the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and
enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the
Town of Putnam".
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission of the Town of Putnam was established in
accordance with an ordinance adopted February 7, 1974 and shall implement the purposes and
provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of
Putnam.
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with
the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue, issue with
terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in the
Town of Putnam pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General

12
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45,
inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating,
licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all
relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses;
b. the applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed
regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to
wetlands or watercourses.
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated
activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity of such wetlands or watercourses.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be
caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would
foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation
measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity
including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other
environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the
following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse
resources;
