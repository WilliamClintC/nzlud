PREFACE 
The Morgan Hill, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1987, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Marc Hynes, city attorney, and Barbara A. Howard, city clerk. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 26, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2302 N.S., passed May 15, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 26, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 26, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.070 - Delegation. 
The purchasing officer may delegate authority to purchase supplies or services and to dispose of surplus supplies to other city officials, if such delegation is deemed necessary for the effective procurement or disposal of those items and approved by the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.080 - Consideration of bids and basis of awards. 
Purchases shall be awarded on the basis of the bid or bids most advantageous to the city. In determining whether a bid is most advantageous to the city, in addition to price, the purchasing officer, city manager or city council may consider the following: 
1.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
2.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
3.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
4.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
5.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with applicable laws and ordinances; 
6.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and the ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
7.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; 
8.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; and 
9.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.090 - Justification for acceptance of a high bid. 
In cases where the purchasing officer makes the purchase and, in the opinion of the purchasing officer, the most advantageous bid is not the lowest bid, the purchasing officer shall prepare and place on file with the department making the purchase, a written statement of his/her opinion and the reason therefor. Such statement shall be open to public inspection at all times during regular business hours. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.100 - Local business price preference. 
A local business shall be given a one percent preference (calculated on the total taxable amount of the purchase), over a bidder that is not a local business. In cases where considering this one percent preference, two or more bids are judged to be equal on the basis of price, quality and service, the local business bidder shall be preferred. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.101 - Local business quotation preference. 
If the lowest price submitted for a purchase is not from a local business, local businesses shall be given a preference in the procurement process if they are otherwise responsive and responsible and within five percent of the lowest price originally submitted by a non-local business. The local business's price will be tabulated as if it were up to five percent lower than the total figure actually set forth in the submitted bid, sufficient to establish the re-tabulated bid as the low bid. The local business would then be awarded the contract at the newly calculated price (deducting the five percent). Local businesses shall have the choice when submitting a bid whether or not they would be willing to reduce their price up to five percent in order to make them the low bidder. The city, when seeking bids or proposals, will notify bidders or proposers that the bids or proposals will be evaluated on the basis of a local preference of five percent of the bid or proposal price. The local business must affirmatively mark on the bid submittal that it would like to apply the local preference. The preference described in this section will be applied in addition to the one percent preference required by Section 3.04.100. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.110 - Purchases in the amount of five thousand dollars or more must be in writing. 
No award for supplies or services where the total amount or value is five thousand dollars or more shall be deemed to be an acceptance of any offer or bid unless and until the same is reduced to writing and signed by the purchasing officer and dispatched to the vendor or purchaser. For purchases under five thousand dollars, informal bidding procedures should be utilized whenever beneficial to the city; provided, however, that written documentation of the amount owed by city shall be obtained prior to any payment by city. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.120 - Informal purchases in an amount of up to ten thousand dollars. 
Where the total amount or value of a purchase is ten thousand dollars, or less, the city manager may delegate the authority to purchase to the department head for the department making the purchase, provided that the department head conducts and completes an informal price checking process through telephone or mail inquiry, comparison of prices on the Internet, or similar process and shall document the information received in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the department head may elect to make any purchase in a total amount or value of up to ten thousand dollars (except as the laws of the state otherwise require) in the following cases: 
1.  By department head approval that said purchase may be made cooperatively, as provided in Section 3.04.180 of this chapter, upon a determination that informal price checking would not be likely to result in a lower price to the city from a responsible bidder or would cause unnecessary expense or delay under the circumstances; or 
2.  By department head approval upon a determination that there is only one source for the required supply or service based on a review of available sources by the purchasing officer and written recommendation therefor. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.130 - Informal purchases in an amount over ten thousand dollars and up to twenty-five thousand dollars.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the purchasing officer may elect to make any purchase in a total amount or value of up to twenty-five thousand dollars (except as the laws of the state otherwise require) in the following cases: 
1.  By purchasing officer approval that said purchase may be made cooperatively, as provided in Section 3.04.180 of this chapter, upon a determination that informal price checking would not be likely to result in a lower price to the city from a responsible bidder or would cause unnecessary expense or delay under the circumstances; or 
2.  By purchasing officer approval upon a determination that there is only one source for the required supply or service based on a review of available sources by the purchasing officer and written recommendation therefor.

2.  By city manager approval that said purchase may be made cooperatively, as provided in Section 3.04.180 of this chapter, upon a determination that competitive bids upon notice would not be likely to result in a lower price to the city from a responsible bidder or would cause unnecessary expense or delay under the circumstances; 
3.  By city manager approval upon a determination that the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety requires said purchase to be made without competitive bids upon notice; or 
4.  By city manager approval upon a determination that there is only one source for the required supply or service based on a review of available sources by the purchasing officer and written recommendation therefor. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)

3.04.160 - Emergency authority of purchasing officer. 
A.  In an emergency as defined in Section 3.04.030 where timely action by the city council is not possible, the purchasing officer may purchase supplies or services, even though the total amount thereof may exceed the amount authorized to be performed by the employees of a public agency for public projects per State of California's Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, without competitive bids or notice. 
B.  At the next succeeding city council meeting, the purchasing officer shall submit to the city council a written report setting forth a statement of the circumstances of such emergency, a description of the supplies or services purchased and the prices thereof.

3.04.170 - Waiver of informalitiesRejection of bids. 
Where the purchasing officer, city manager or city council are required to make purchases upon competitive bids, said officer, manager or city council may waive any informalities or minor irregularities, or may reject any and all bids (anything contained in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding) if said officer, manager or city council, respectively, deems said rejection to be in the best interests of the city. Said rejection shall be at the sole discretion of the officer, manager or city council, as the case may be. Upon rejection of bids, the officer, manager or city council may: 
1.  Give subsequent notice for new competitive bids; 
2.  Postpone said purchase or disposal definitely or indefinitely; or

The purchasing officer may either: (1) buy directly from a vendor at a price established by a competitive bid by another jurisdiction even if the city had not joined with the public agency in a cooperative purchase; or (2) compare bids among cooperative purchasing plans or programs and choose the bid that best matches the needs of the city. The purchasing officer shall not, however, shop the cooperative purchasing process bid to private vendors. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.190 - Competitive bidsNotice. 
Where notice is required, notice shall be given as follows:

2.  Posting on the city's website. 
(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.200 - Competitive bids.

3.04.230 - Reserved.  
3.04.240 - Consultant contracts.

Consultants are required for professional or technical expertise and for matters requiring specialized abilities or a high degree of skill. Their numbers in relation to a particular skill or expertise required are comparatively limited. Where consultants are involved, the bidding process is not likely to result in a lower price to the city or eliminate unnecessary expense or delay. 
B.  The officer or official responsible for the purchase  the purchasing officer, city manager or city council, respectively  shall be empowered to engage a consultant (including, but not limited to, material testing service, construction inspection services, architectural, engineering, testing, land surveying, appraising, environmental, planning, financial, legal, development processing, governmental operations, special studies, construction project management, information technology and services graphic design and other services related thereto) without the necessity of an informal bid or competitive bid or notice thereof in the following circumstances and subject to the following criteria and conditions: 
1.  Subject to the delegation of the city manager, with department head approval if the consultant's total fee for services and supplies under the contract by which the consultant is engaged on a per project basis, including any amendments to the contract, does not exceed ten thousand dollars, so long as there exists a sufficient unencumbered appropriation in the fund against which the contract expense may be appropriately charged and provided further that any bifurcation of a purchase or contract into subunits or phases for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amounts set forth in this section is prohibited; or 
2.  With city manager approval if the consultant's total fee for services and supplies under the contract by which the consultant is engaged on a per project basis, including any amendments to the contract, does not exceed the amount authorized to be performed by the employees of a public agency for public projects per State of California's Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, so long as there exists a sufficient unencumbered appropriation in the fund against which the contract expense may be appropriately charged and provided further that any bifurcation of a purchase or contract into subunits or phases for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amounts set forth in this section is prohibited; or 
3.  With city council approval if the consultant's total fee for services and supplies under the contract by which the consultant is engaged on a per project basis exceeds the amount authorized to be performed by the employees of a public agency for public projects per State of California's Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act. City council approval is not required for services in excess of the amount authorized to be performed by the employees of a public agency for public projects per State of California's Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act if the consultant's total fee for services and supplies is to provide environmental services for a project that will be paid for by a development processing project applicant.

(Ord. No. 2285 N.S., 10-17-2018)  
3.04.250 - Request for proposals. 
A.  In lieu of competitive bidding, the officer or official responsible for the purchase  the purchasing officer, city manager or city council, respectively  may utilize the request for proposal method of purchasing supplies or services upon a determination that competitive bidding is not practical or advantageous to the city because of one or more of the following reasons: 
1.  Quality, capability, performance or qualification is overriding in relation to price; 
2.  Delivery, installation, service, maintenance, reliability or replacement is overriding in relation to price; 
3.  In the opinion of the purchasing officer, city manager or city council, respectively, the marketplace will respond better to a solicitation permitting a range of alternative proposals or evaluation and discussion of proposals before entering the contract; or 
4.  Any of the considerations set forth in Section 3.04.080 are overriding. 
B.  The identity of persons responding to the request for proposals and the content of proposals submitted to the city may be kept confidential during the process of negotiation and until a contract is awarded, if deemed necessary by the purchasing officer, city manager or city council to receive the best proposal. 
C.  The formats and procedures for requests for proposals shall be established by the purchasing officer. 
D.  The contract award shall be based upon the proposal determined by the purchasing officer, city manager or city council, respectively, to be most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. 
E.  The purchasing officer, city manager or city council, respectively, may reject any and all proposals if such rejection is deemed to be in the best interests of the city and may thereupon direct that proposals be solicited or utilize any other purchasing method set forth in this section. 
F.  As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors, or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.

Alternatively, the city council may elect to sell, rent, donate or destroy the same in accordance with whatever provision and/or terms and conditions the city council may, in its discretion, elect.

A.  The person or business is enrolled in the city's use tax incentive program. 
B.  The person or entity has obtained a State of California Use Tax Direct Payment Permit pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7051.3, or a Sub Sellers Permit pursuant to State Board of Equalization Operations Memo No. 1023 ("permit").

(Ord. No. 2250 N.S., § 1, 6-28-2017)  
3.21.020 - Rebate claim procedure. 
A.  Within forty-five days after the close of the state's tax reporting quarter, an eligible person or entity doing business in Morgan Hill may file a rebate claim with the city's finance director, on a form provided by the finance director. 
B.  The claim must contain evidence of the amount of the use Tax paid to the state. The director may request from the claimant any other information necessary to substantiate the rebate claim. 
(Ord. No. 2250 N.S., § 1, 6-28-2017)  
3.21.030 - Calculation and issuance of use tax rebate. 
A.  The finance director shall issue the rebate within ninety days of verification that the city received the correct amount of funds from the state. The use tax rebate shall be based upon the following schedule: 
Net New Use Tax Received by the City of Morgan Hill (4 consecutive quarters) 	Rebate Percentage 
0$100,000 	20% 
$100,001$200,000 	25% 
$200,001 and greater 	30% 
 
B.  The rebate shall be paid by check directly to the claimant but shall be increased or decreased in accordance with any adjustment made by the state to a prior use tax payment by the claimant. 
C.  Upon enrollment in the use tax incentive program, the city will determine the baseline use tax received by the city from the taxpayer as follows: 
1.  For direct payment permittees, by averaging the amount of tax received by the city from that taxpayer over the twelve quarters prior to enrollment; 
2.  For sub sellers permittees, by averaging the amount of tax received from that construction site over the twelve quarters prior to enrollment. 
D.  "Net new use tax", for the purposes of this chapter, shall mean the difference between the amount of taxes actually received by the city resulting from the taxpayer's permit and the baseline amount as calculated for the taxpayer upon enrollment in the use tax incentive program. 
E.  The rebate will be paid quarterly based on twenty percent of the net new use tax received in each quarter. After four consecutive quarters, the city will adjust the percentage if warranted, based on the total net new use tax received over the prior four quarters. The rebate amount for the fourth consecutive quarter will reflect the amount attributed to the adjusted percentage, if applicable. 
F.  For the purposes of this calculation, the quarters are based on the taxpayer's tax reporting calendar, but the calculation is based on the four consecutive quarters immediately following enrollment in the use tax incentive program. 
G.  Once the rebate has been provided for the fourth consecutive quarter, the calculation of the rebate for the next four quarters will begin again.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2179 N.S., § 1, adopted Dec. 2, 2015, amended Chapter 3.24 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 3.24, §§ 3.24.0103.24.180, pertained to transient occupancy tax. See Code Comparative Table for a detailed history of derivation. 
 
3.24.010 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location located outside a mobile home park and not occupied by employees, operator or owner of said mobile home park, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portions thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property, and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the assistant city manager for administrative services, or designee, to be charged with administration of the tax. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. 
(Ord. No. 2179 N.S., § 1, 12-2-2015)  
3.24.020 - Tax imposedAmount. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent, effective April 20, 1991, of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city . 
(Ord. No. 2179 N.S., § 1, 12-2-2015)  
3.24.030 - Tax imposedExemptions. 
A.  No tax shall be imposed upon: 
1.  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter; 
2.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
B.  No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2179 N.S., § 1, 12-2-2015)  
3.24.040 - Collection of taxOperator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.

In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at the last known place of address.

If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties.

Chapter 3.54 - RECREATION FEES 
Sections: 
 
3.54.010 - Recreation fees. 
The following types of fees may be established, pursuant to resolution adopted by the council, for recreation services: (1) class fees; (2) facility rental fees; and (3) administrative processing fees. In regards to facility rental and administrative processing fees, the city manager or designate will conduct a fee analysis to be utilized in establishing such fees. The goal will be to enable the city to recover an increasingly greater share of total costs for adult activities and rental services. Emphasis in youth services will be on ensuring appropriate cost recovery while minimizing the impact on youth participation. A balance will be sought between appropriate cost recovery and providing affordable, quality recreational services in all three instances. 
(Ord. 1571 N.S. § 1, 2002: Ord. 1030 N.S. § 1 (part), 1991)  
3.54.020 - Establishment and revision of fees. 
A.  The following factors may be considered in establishing and revising fees: 
1.  Market analysis of public and private sector agencies, which are providing recreation opportunities; 
2.  Market survey of fees charged for recreation services by the agencies in the market survey; 
3.  Cost study of programs and services offered by the recreation division to ensure that fees are appropriately related to costs; 
4.  Projections of attendance levels for public and private recreation programs based on data collected by the city. 
B.  Class fees: The city manager is authorized to determine class fees, which fees should consider the above factors and be based on a reasonable cost recovery estimate. 
C.  Special exceptions: For special classes or programs not included in the published activity guide, a new fee may be charged as soon as approved by the city manager. 
(Ord. 1571 N.S. § 2, 2002: Ord. 1030 N.S. § 1 (part), 1991)  
Chapter 3.56 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT MITIGATION FEES 
Sections: 
 
3.56.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The city council of the city of Morgan Hill finds and declares that all recitals set forth in the preamble of the ordinance codified in this chapter are true and such recitals are incorporated in this chapter and set forth as findings of the city council; and the council does further find and declare as follows: 
A.  The state of California, through the enactment of Government Code Sections 66001 through 66009 has determined the nexus that must be established in the enactment of development impact fees. 
B.  The imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bear a proportionate share of the cost of public facilities and service improvements necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
C.  This chapter recognizes that new development within the city will result in additional growth and that such growth will place additional burdens on various city facilities, infrastructure and services. This chapter further recognizes the types of land development that will generate impacts necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them. 
D.  All land uses within the city should bear a proportionate financial burden in the construction and improvement of public facilities and services necessary to serve them. 
E.  The cost of providing public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects within the city exceeds the revenue generated by fees exacted from the development projects. 
F.  The city adopts the reports referenced in the preamble of the ordinance codified in this chapter as prepared by consultants MSI, ARI, DKS, DMG Maximus, and Hilton Farnkopf and Hobson, and as respectively titled and dated, which establish various costs for providing various public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects within the city. 
G.  The development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs which are generated through the need for new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required, incrementally, by new development within the city. 
H.  The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city. 
I.  The fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by the development projects within the city, which public facilities are consistent with the general plan and the housing element of the general plan of the city. 
J.  The public facilities and anticipated future development referenced in this chapter are based upon an analysis of existing and projected land use and zoning. 
K.  The fees established by this chapter are consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts caused by new development throughout the city. Development impact fees are necessary in order to finance the required public facilities and service improvements and to pay for new development's fair share of their construction costs. 
L.  Imposition of fees to finance public facilities and service improvements required by new development is necessary in order to avoid adversely impacting existing facilities and services. 
M.  The city has pending before it subdivision maps and other applications for residential, commercial and industrial development approval which the city must act upon. Further, the city has heretofore approved various development projects in the form of tentative maps or other approvals, which have been expressly conditioned on payment of the fees established as a result of the development impact fee study undertaken by consultants MSI, ARI, DKS, DMG Maximus, and Hilton Farnkopf and Hobson, and the condition was assented to by the developers of these projects. It is necessary for the provisions of this chapter to apply to these developments in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare by the provision of adequate public facilities, to afford developers certainty with regard to their financial obligations, and to ensure that such development will not create a burden on the interrelated public facilities and services networks of the city. 
(Ord. 1570 N.S. § 13, 2002; Ord. 1122 N.S. (part), 1993)

(Ord. No. 1945 N.S., § 1, 7-1-2009)  
3.56.080 - Zoning to be utilized to compute fee. 
The approved zoning for the property to be developed shall be used in the computation of the fees required to be paid with respect to any property.

B.  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of public facilities for which development impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type to which the fees involved relate. 
C.  At least once each fiscal period, the city manager of the city ("city manager"), or duly authorized designee shall present to the city council a proposed five-year capital improvement program for the various public facilities referenced in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.56.030 assigning moneys (including any accrued interest) from the funds referenced in Section 3.56.070 to specific improvement projects and related expenses.

Chapter 5.20 - FRANCHISES FOR CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS 
 
5.20.010 - Intent. 
A.  Authority. In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, reconstruct, operate, and maintain cable television systems within the city limits. 
B.  Findings. The city council finds that the development of cable television and telecommunications systems may provide significant benefits for, and substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers to be vested in the city. It is the intent of this chapter to specify the means for providing the best possible cable television and telecommunications services to the public, and the issuance of all franchises under this chapter are intended to achieve this primary objective. It is the further intent of this chapter to establish regulatory provisions that permit the city to regulate cable television and telecommunications franchises to the extent authorized by federal and state law, including but not limited to the federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and applicable California law. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.020 - Short title. 
This chapter may be cited as the "cable television and telecommunications regulatory ordinance" of the city of Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.030 - Defined terms and phrases. 
Various terms and phrases used in this chapter are defined below in Section 5.20.170. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.040 - Franchise terms and conditions. 
A.  Franchise Purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter may authorize the grantee to do the following: 
1.  To engage in the business of providing cable television services, and such other telecommunications services as may be authorized by law that the grantee chooses to provide to subscribers within the designated franchise service area. 
2.  To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area. 
3.  To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification, and distribution of television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such other services as may be permitted by law. 
B.  Franchise Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct, install, or operate a cable television system in the city within any street or public way without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Term of the Franchise. 
1.  A franchise granted under this chapter will be for the term specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the ordinance or resolution adopted by the city that authorizes the franchise. 
2.  A franchise granted under this chapter may be renewed upon application by the grantee in accordance with the applicable provisions of state and federal law and of this chapter. 
D.  Franchise Territory. A franchise is effective within the territorial limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement. 
E.  Federal or State Jurisdiction. This chapter will be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and is applicable to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter, to the extent authorized by applicable law. 
F.  Franchise Nontransferable. 
1.  The grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the city council is null and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection. 
2.  The requirements of subsection (F)(1) of this section apply to any change in control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If the grantee is a corporation, prior authorization of the council is required where ownership or control of more than ten percent of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom, singularly or collectively, own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise. 
3.  The grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee's franchise property, or upon the termination of any lease or other interest covering all or a substantial part of that franchise property. Such notification will be considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this subsection that require the prior consent of the city to that change in control of ownership shall apply. 
4.  For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee or the proposed transferee, or both, must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent. This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements for the remaining term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city shall consent to the transfer of the franchise. The consent of the city to that transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. 
5.  Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system upon the grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial institution also must submit a plan for such operation within ninety days after assuming control. The plan must insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee. 
6.  The grantee shall reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise. These expenses include, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation expenses. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise. 
G.  Geographical Coverage. 
1.  The grantee shall design, construct, and maintain the cable television system so as to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the city, subject to any service-area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement. 
2.  After service has been established by activating trunk or distribution cables for any service area, the grantee shall provide service to any requesting subscriber in that service area within thirty days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that thirty day period. 
H.  Nonexclusive Franchise. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system, or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. However, if an additional franchise is granted on terms more favorable to the second grantee (whether involving the grant of greater benefits or the imposition of lesser obligations), then the initial grantee shall have the right to modify its franchise to incorporate the more favorable terms, or to reduce its obligations, to achieve competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory treatment. 
I.  Multiple Franchises. 
1.  The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
a.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage. 
b.  The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service. 
c.  The disadvantages that may result from multiple cable systems, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way. 
2.  Developers of new residential housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two cable television systems and must dedicate the use of that conduit to the city. 
3.  The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city's opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate additional cables. 
J.  Limitation on Expense Reimbursement. Any obligation imposed on the grantee to reimburse the city in reviewing any new franchise application or the transfer or renewal of any existing franchise or in otherwise regulating a franchise under this chapter shall be subject to any limitations on the amount of such reimbursement provided for in the franchise agreement.

A.  Filing of Applications. Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable television system shall file an application with the city. A reasonable nonrefundable application fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council must accompany the application. That application fee will cover all costs associated with reviewing and processing the application, including without limitation costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the applicant, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by those experts), notice and publication requirements, and document preparation expenses. If those actual costs exceed the application fee, the applicant shall pay the difference to the city within thirty days following receipt of an itemized statement of those costs. 
B.  ApplicationsContents. An application for an initial franchise for a cable television system shall contain, where applicable: 
1.  A statement as to the proposed franchise service area.

C.  Consideration of Initial Applications. 
1.  Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the city manager or the city manager's designee shall prepare a report and make recommendations to the city council concerning that application. 
2.  A public hearing shall be set prior to any initial franchise grant, at a time and date approved by the city council. Within thirty days after the close of the hearing, the city council shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether the franchise should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The city council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
D.  Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewals shall be made in accordance with applicable law. The city and the grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)

E.  Subscriber Complaints and Disputes. 
1.  The grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing, specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with the city.

4.  Upon a change of control of the grantee, or if a new operator acquires the cable system, the original the grantee must cooperate with the city, the new grantee, or the new operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During that transition period, the grantee is entitled to the revenues derived from its operation of the system. 
F.  Disconnection/Downgrades. 
1.  A subscriber may terminate or downgrade service at any time, and the grantee shall promptly comply with the subscriber's request without charge within five days. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers. 
2.  The grantee may disconnect a subscribers service if the subscriber fails to pay a monthly fee or charge, but such disconnection shall not occur prior to forty-five days after the fee or charge is due plus ten days prior written notice to the subscriber of the grantee's intent to disconnect service. In the event that the subscriber pays all past due amounts, including late charges, before the scheduled disconnection date, the grantee shall not disconnect service. In the event that service is disconnected for nonpayment of past due fees or charges, the grantee shall promptly reinstate service upon payment by the subscriber in full of all such fees and charges, including late charges.

G.  Changes in Service. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, subscribers shall not be required to pay any additional fee or charge, other than the regular service fee, in order to receive the services selected (such as upgrade or downgrade charges). No charge may be imposed for any service or product that the subscriber has not affirmatively selected. Payment of the regular monthly bill shall not by itself constitute an affirmative selection. 
H.  Deposits. The grantee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers. Such deposits shall be placed in an interest bearing account. The deposit shall be returned, with interest earned to the date of repayment, within thirty days after the equipment is returned to the grantee. 
I.  Parental Control Option. The grantee shall provide parental control devices to all subscribers who want to be able to block the video or audio portion of any programming that the subscriber finds objectionable. Such devices shall be provided at no charge to the subscriber, unless a converter box is required to be installed or unless otherwise required by federal law. 
J.  Additional Requirements. 
1.  If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without the city's prior approval or subsequent ratification, the city may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an operator until the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city, or until a permanent operator is selected. If the city satisfies this obligation on behalf of the grantee, then during that period the city is entitled to collect all revenues derived from the system, and the grantee shall indemnify the city against any damages that the city may suffer as a result of the grantee's failure to operate the system. 
2.  All officers, agents, or employees of the grantee, or its contractors or subcontractors, who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public, or who require entry onto subscribers' premises, must carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by the city. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. All vehicles of the grantee or its subcontractors shall be clearly identified as vehicles engaged in providing services for the grantee. 
3.  Additional standards relating to service, customer protection, and response by the grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance, before or after a franchise is granted. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that the grantee is entitled to receive written notification and an opportunity to cure, before any sanction is imposed. 
K.  Penalties for Noncompliance. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to impose penalties for the violation of the customer service standards established by this chapter as authorized by the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Section 53088 et seq.) These penalties are in addition to the remedies provided by Section 5.20.130. The imposition of such penalties shall not prevent the city from exercising any other remedy provided by law. 
2.  Administration and Appeals. 
a.  The city manager or his designee is authorized to administer this subsection. Decisions by the city manager to assess penalties against the grantee shall be in writing and shall contain findings supporting the decisions.

c.  Schedule of Penalties.

d.  Judicial Remedy. Nothing in this schedule shall preclude a party affected by this subsection from utilizing any judicial remedy available to that party. 
e.  Notification of Breach.

3.  Upon thirty days prior written notice, the city has the right to conduct an independent audit of the grantee's records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If that audit indicates a franchise fee or in-lieu fee underpayment of two percent or more, the grantee shall assume and pay all reasonable costs of that audit. 
4.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by the city will be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable as a franchise fee or in-lieu fee under this chapter, or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
5.  If any franchise or in-lieu fee payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation: 
a.  An interest charge, computed from the specified due date until the date that payment is made, at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate of any national bank selected by the city, plus one percent; and

3.  In those areas of the city where the grantee's cables are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of any public utility providing telephone or electric power service, and if the facilities of both those city's public utilities are subsequently placed underground, then the grantee must likewise reconstruct, operate, and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at the grantee's sole cost. The grantee's equipment, which normally is placed above ground, such as pedestals, amplifiers, and power supplies, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement.

The height of all aerial wires above public thoroughfares must conform to the requirements of the California regulatory agency having jurisdiction over this matter. 
a.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the grantee must be located so as not to interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places, and so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of those streets, alleys, or other public ways and places. These facilities must not interfere with existing public utility installations.

g.  The grantee may be required by the city to permit joint use by other utilities of its property and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys, or other public rights-of-way, insofar as that joint use is reasonably practicable and payment of reasonable rental is required; provided, however, that in the absence of agreement regarding such joint use, the city will provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of that joint use, including the compensation to be paid for it, and the arbitration award will be final. 
h.  The grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the city, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings.

i.  The grantee has the authority, except when in conflict with any existing law, to trim trees that are upon or overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public places so as to prevent the branches of those trees from coming in contact with the grantee's wires and cables. However, at the option of the city, such trimming may be done by the city, or under its supervision and direction, at the expense of the grantee. 
B.  Multiple Franchises. 
1.  If more than one franchise is awarded, the city reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to require that the drop cable or cables be used only by the cable operator selected by the resident to provide service. 
2.  The city reserves the right to grant an encroachment permit to an applicant for a cable franchise to install conduit or cable in anticipation of the granting of that franchise. Such installations are at the applicant's sole risk, with no recourse against the city if the pending franchise application is not granted.

1.  Each year during the term of the franchise, if requested by the city, the grantee and the city will meet publicly to review system performance and quality of service. The various reports required by this chapter, results of technical performance tests, the record of subscriber complaints and the grantee's response to those complaints, and the information obtained from any subscriber surveys will be used as the basis for review. In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the review meetings, either orally or in writing, and these comments or complaints also will be considered. Within thirty days after the conclusion of a system performance review meeting, the city may issue findings with respect to the grantee's compliance with the franchise and quality of service. 
2.  If the city determines that the grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement, the city may direct the grantee to correct the areas of noncompliance within a reasonable period of time. Failure of the grantee, after due notice, to correct the areas of noncompliance within the period specified, or to commence compliance within that period and diligently achieve compliance thereafter, will be deemed a material breach of the franchise, and the city may exercise any remedy provided by this chapter or the franchise agreement. 
B.  Special Review. 
1.  When complaints are made, or where other evidence exists that, in the city's judgment, casts reasonable doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service and indicates that the grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or its franchise, the city has the right to compel the grantee to test, analyze, and report on the performance of the system in order to protect the public against substandard cable service. 
2.  The city may not compel the grantee to provide such tests or reports unless the city has provided the grantee with at least thirty days notice of its intention to exercise its rights under this subsection and has provided the grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to the exercise of these rights. 
3.  The test or tests shall be made and the report delivered to the city, at the grantee's sole cost, no later than thirty days after the city notifies the grantee that it is exercising its rights. The report must include the following information: the nature of the complaints that precipitated the special tests; the system components that were tested; the equipment and procedures used in the testing; the results of the tests; and the method by which the complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the special tests must be reported. 
C.  Special Evaluation Sessions. The city may hold special evaluation sessions at any time during the term of the franchise, provided that these sessions are held not more frequently than once every three years. The grantee shall be notified of the time, place, and date of the sessions and the topics to be discussed. These sessions will be open to the public and advertised in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days before each session. The sessions may include an evaluation of any items considered relevant to the cable system, the subscribers, and the city. Either the city or the grantee may propose items for discussion or evaluation. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.130 - Franchise violations. 
A.  Remedies for Franchise Violations. If the grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any obligation set forth in this chapter or in a franchise granted hereunder, following notice from the city and an opportunity to cure that nonperformance in accordance with the provisions of this section or the franchise agreement, the city may, in its sole discretion: 
1.  Cure the violation and recover the actual cost of cure from the security fund if the violation is not cured within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of the city's intention to cure and to draw upon the security fund. 
2.  Assess liquidated damages against the grantee in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement if the violation is not cured, or if the grantee has not commenced to cure, on a schedule acceptable to the city, within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of the city's intention to assess liquidated damages. This assessment may be withdrawn from the security fund, and will not constitute a waiver by the city of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from the grantee any additional damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including actual attorney's fees, that may have been suffered or incurred by the city by reason of or arising out of that breach of the franchise. 
B.  Procedure for Remedying Franchise Violations. Prior to imposing any remedy or other sanction specified in this section, the city must give the grantee notice and the opportunity to be heard on the matter, in accordance with the following procedures: 
1.  The city must first notify the grantee of the violation in writing, by personal delivery or by certified mail, return-receipt requested, and demand correction within a reasonable time. That time period may not be less than fifteen days in the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any amount due the city under this chapter or the franchise agreement, and thirty days in all other cases. If the grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if the grantee fails to commence correction of the violation within the time prescribed and diligently remedy the violation, the city shall then give not less than thirty days written notice of a public hearing to be held by the city council. The notice must specify the violations alleged to have occurred. 
2.  At the public hearing, the city council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, and then render its findings and decision. 
3.  If the city council finds that the grantee has corrected the violation, or has commenced correction of the violation after notice from the city and is diligently proceeding to remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, then the proceedings will terminate and no penalty or other sanction will be imposed. 
4.  If the city council finds that violations exist and that the grantee has not corrected them in a satisfactory manner, or has not commenced correction of the violation after notice from the city and is not diligently proceeding to remedy the violation to the satisfaction of the city, then the city council may, in its discretion, impose one or more of the remedies provided in this chapter or in the franchise agreement, as may be appropriate under the circumstances. 
C.  City's Power to Revoke. The city reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted under this chapter and to rescind all rights and privileges associated with it in any of the following circumstances, each of which constitutes a default by the grantee under the franchise: 
1.  The grantee's default in the performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement and the continuance of that default after receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure. 
2.  The grantee's failure to provide, or to maintain in full force and effect, the insurance coverage or security fund in the amounts specified in the franchise agreement. 
3.  The grantee's violation of any order or ruling of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the franchise, unless that order or ruling is being contested in good faith by the grantee in judicial or administrative proceedings. 
4.  The grantee's acts or omissions that involve any fraud or deceit as to the city. 
5.  The grantee's insolvency, inability to pay its debts, or adjudication as a bankrupt. 
The revocation and termination of the grantee's franchise does not affect any right of the city to pursue any other remedy under the franchise or applicable law. 
(Ord. 1416 N.S. § 17, 1998; Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.140 - Force majeureGrantee's inability to perform. 
If the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, or obligations required by this chapter or by a franchise granted hereunder is prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee's control, that inability to perform will be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions will be imposed; provided, however, that such inability to perform will not relieve the grantee from any obligations imposed by Section 5.20.060(C)(4) pertaining to refunds and credits for interruptions in service. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of the grantee include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires. Such causes or events do not include the financial inability of the grantee to perform, the failure of the grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies, the failure to obtain the right to use the facilities of any public utility where that failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of the grantee, or the failure of the grantee to obtain supplies, services, or equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of the cable television system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure those supplies, services, or equipment.

A.  Abandonment or Removal. 
1.  If the use of any property of the grantee within the public rights-of-way is discontinued for a consecutive twelve-month period, the grantee will be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property. Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system, and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for all or a portion of the system, will not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use. 
2.  Upon such terms as the city may impose, the city may authorize the grantee to abandon, and not remove, any underground facility or equipment that is laid, constructed, operated, or maintained under the franchise. Unless that authorization is granted, or unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, the grantee shall remove all underground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the city and restore any affected street to the state existing at the time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment, the grantee must refill, at its sole expense, any excavation made by it and must leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal and without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments. The city has the right to inspect and approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments, and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity, and insurance provisions of this chapter, and the security fund provided by the grantee will continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this subsection. 
3.  Upon abandonment in place of any franchise property, the grantee, if required by the city, shall submit to the city an instrument, satisfactory in form to the city, transferring to the city the ownership of the abandoned franchise property. 
4.  Upon expiration of the term of the franchise, or upon its earlier revocation or termination, the city has the right to require the grantee to remove, at its sole expense, all above-ground portions of the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the city within a reasonable period of time, which will be not less than one hundred eighty days. 
B.  Restoration by the CityReimbursement of Costs. If the grantee fails to complete any work required by this chapter, the franchise agreement, or any other law, or if that work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of written notice from the city, or, if more than thirty days are reasonably required for that work, the grantee does not commence the work within that thirty day period and diligently complete the work, then the city may cause that work to be done. The grantee shall reimburse the city the costs of completing that work within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of those costs, or the city may recover those costs from the security fund provided by the grantee. 
C.  Extended Operation and Continuity of Services. Upon either the expiration or revocation of the franchise, the city may authorize the grantee to continue to operate the cable television system for an extended period of time. In such event, the grantee must continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber services and any other services that may then be provided. All subscribers will have the right to continue to receive all available services, provided their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. The grantee shall use all reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during any transition period following franchise expiration or termination. 
D.  Receivership and Foreclosure. 
1.  A franchise granted in accordance with this chapter will, at the option of the city, terminate one hundred twenty days after the appointment of a receiver or a trustee to take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or similar action or proceeding, unless that receivership or trusteeship is vacated prior to the expiration of that one hundred twenty day period, or unless: 
a.  The receiver or trustee, within one hundred twenty days after election or appointment, fully complies with all terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and remedies all defaults under the franchise or provides a plan to remedy those defaults that is satisfactory to the city; and 
b.  The receiver or trustee, within that one hundred twenty day period, executes an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the matter, whereby the receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by every provision of the franchise agreement. 
2.  Upon a foreclosure or judicial sale of the franchise property, or any material part of that property, the city may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at that sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee under that franchise will terminate thirty days after service of that notice, unless: 
a.  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise in the manner provided by this chapter; and 
b.  The successful bidder covenants and agrees with the city to assume and to be bound by all provisions of the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 1371 N.S. § 1 (part), 1997)  
5.20.160 - Rights of the city and subscribers. 
A.  City's Reservation of Rights. In addition to the rights specifically reserved to the city by this chapter, the city reserves to itself every right and power that may be reserved by the provisions of any law or the franchise agreement. 
B.  Waiver. The city has the right to waive any provisions of the franchise agreement, except those required by federal or state laws or regulations, if the city determines that it is in the public interest to do so, and that the enforcement of those provisions will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the city. The waiver of any provision in one instance will not be deemed a waiver of that provision in any other instance, nor will it be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless that fact is so stated. 
C.  Rights of Individuals. 
1.  The grantee may not deny service or access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or residents on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex. The grantee must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to nondiscrimination. 
2.  The grantee must comply with all applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as they now exist or as they may be amended from time to time. 
3.  Neither the grantee, nor any other person or entity may, without a subscriber's consent, tap, or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose other than routine maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service, polling with audience participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be identified. 
4.  In providing its services, or in pursuing any collateral commercial enterprise relating to those services, the grantee must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or a resident's right of privacy, and other civil rights, as delineated or defined by applicable law. The grantee may not, without a lawful court order or other legal authority, use any interactive two-way equipment or capability of the cable system for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or resident. 
5.  No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter, or other equipment owned by the grantee may be installed in a subscriber's premises, other than in lawfully-obtained easements, without first obtaining any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon that subscriber's property will be presumed. 
6.  Neither the grantee, nor any of its agents, employees or subcontractors, may sell, or otherwise make available to any person, without the prior written consent of the subscriber under state and federal privacy laws, any of the following: 
a.  A list containing the names and addresses any subscribers who have requested in writing to be removed from that list. 
b.  Any list that identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing to other persons composite ratings of subscriber viewing preferences.

Chapter 5.36 - MOBILE HOME PARK RENTS*  
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
5.36.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Mobile home owners, unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock, are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a residence for which space is rented or leased. Removal and/or relocation of a mobile home from a park space is not a practical alternative to accepting an excessive rent increase in that it can only be accomplished at substantial cost, and in many instances may cause extensive damage to the mobile home and loss of appurtenances such as integrated landscaping and supporting structures inconsistent with the new location. Because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens, persons on fixed incomes, and persons of low and moderate income, exorbitant rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness. 
B.  The city has sponsored extensive negotiations to eliminate the need for the ordinance codified in this chapter. Only one of the city's mobile home parks achieved a mediated solution as a result of this delay. The remaining parks were unable to reach agreement after extensive negotiation; thus, necessitating the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
C.  Since approximately July, 1981, a heightened pattern of excessive rent increases has emerged within some of the mobile home parks in the city in disregard of the purposes and intent of the city's previous ordinances. Incorporation of these unduly excessive prior increases within the rate structure of this chapter without provisions for their review would materially defeat the purposes and intent of this chapter and the stability it seeks to bring about. 
D.  The city council declares that it is necessary in the public interest to establish a means by which to resolve the potentially divisive and harmful impasse between park owners and coach owners. After consideration of numerous factors, among which are the relatively small number of parks located within the city, the level of organization and communication between mobile home owners in each park, and mandates of state law, regulations which best fit the needs of the city have been selected. 
E.  The regulations which are set forth in this chapter are designed to produce stability in rent increases for mobile home park tenants while recognizing the rights of mobile home park owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their property. The standards, utilizing the concept of net operating income and a 1981 base year, adopted by Sections 5.36.250 through 5.36.320 of this chapter are intended to provide the necessary adjustment mechanism to meet constitutional requirements. 
F.  The council finds that the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter will not have a significant, substantial or adverse effect on the physical environment of the community because enactment of this chapter involves no deviation from the general plan and no change in the present use of any property within the city.

(Ord. No. 1929 N.S., § 2, 4-22-2009)  
5.36.260 - Rent adjustment proceedingsTerminology. 
For the purposes of space rent adjustment proceedings, the following definitions shall be used: 
A.  "Net operating income" equals gross income less operating expenses. 
B.  "Gross income" equals: 
1.  Gross rents, computed as gross rental income at one hundred percent paid occupancy; plus 
2.  Interest from rental deposits, unless directly paid by the landlord to the tenants (interest shall be computed at the rate of five and one-half percent of all deposits unless such deposits earn greater interest); plus 
3.  Income from laundry facilities, cleaning fees or services, garage and parking fees; plus 
4.  All other income or consideration received or receivable for or in connection with the use or occupancy of rental units and housing services, services, garage and parking fees; 
5.  Minus uncollected rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent that the same are beyond the owner's control. Uncollected rents in excess of three percent of gross rents shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise. Where uncollected rents must be estimated, the average of the preceding three years experience shall be used, or some other comparable method. 
C.  1.  "Operating expenses" shall include the following: 
a.  Real property taxes; 
b.  Utility costs; 
c.  Management expenses (contracted or owner performed), including necessary and reasonable advertising, accounting, insurance and other managerial expenses and allowable legal expenses. Management expenses are presumed to be five percent of gross income, unless established otherwise; 
d.  Normal repair and maintenance expenses, including painting, normal cleaning, fumigation, landscaping and repair of all standard services, including electrical, plumbing and sanitary sewer; 
e.  i. Owner-performed labor, which shall be compensated at the following hourly rates upon documentation being provided showing the date, time and nature of the work performed: 
(A)  General maintenance at the general prevailing hourly wage as set out in the most recent "Report of The Labor Commission, U.S. Department of Labor," 
(B)  Skilled labor at two times such rate; 
ii.  Notwithstanding the above, an owner may receive greater or lesser compensation for self-labor if it can be shown that the amounts set forth above are substantially unfair in a given case. There shall be a maximum allowance under this subsection of five percent of gross income, unless the owner shows greater services for the benefit of tenants; 
f.  Rehabilitation or repair work done on or in a mobile home park in order to comply with an order issued by the building department, or to repair damage resulting from fire, earthquake or other natural disaster; 
g.  License and registration fees required by law to the extent the same are not otherwise paid by tenants; 
h.  Capital expenses with a total cost of less than one hundred dollars per year per benefited space, and the amortized portion of other capital expenses otherwise allowed by regulation. 
2.  Operating expenses shall not include: 
a.  Avoidable and unnecessary expenses/increases since the base year; 
b.  Mortgage principal and interest payments; 
c.  Any penalties, fees or interest assessed or awarded for violation of this or any other law; 
d.  Attorneys' fees and legal costs in connection with civil actions against the city; 
e.  Depreciation; 
f.  Any expense for which the owner has been reimbursed by any security deposit, insurance settlement, judgment for damages, settlement or any other method;

D.  Base year for purposes of these regulations shall mean calendar year 1981. 
E.  Consumer Price Index is defined in subsection D of Section 5.36.020 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 856 N.S. § 1 (part), 1988)  
5.36.270 - Presumption of base year net operating income. 
Except as provided in Section 5.36.280(A) of this article, it shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by a property during the base year provided a just and reasonable return on property. Owners shall be entitled to maintain and increase their net operating income from year to year in accordance with Section 5.36.310 of this article. 
(Ord. 856 N.S. § 1 (part), 1988)  
5.36.280 - Adjustment to income computationConditions. 
It may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded other than a just and reasonable return on property, in which case, the base year net operating income may be adjusted accordingly. In order to make such determination, the hearing panel must make at least one of the following findings: 
A.  Owner's operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. The hearing panel shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The owner made substantial capital improvements during 1981, which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date; 
2.  Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster or vandalism; 
3.  Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services; 
4.  Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the following of prudent business practice. In making this determination, the fact that property taxes prior to 1981 may have been higher than in the base year shall not be considered. 
B.  The rent on the base date was disproportionate due to one of the enumerated factors below. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating gross rents consistent with the purposes of this chapter: 
1.  The rent on the base date was established by a lease or other formal rental agreement which provided for substantially higher rent at other periods during the term of the lease; 
2.  The rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations in rent; 
3.  The rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than preceding months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates being given for reasons unique to particular spaces or limited to the period determining the base rent. 
C.  It shall be presumed that where net operating income is less than fifty percent of gross income in the base year, after making adjustments as permitted by subsections A and B of this section, the owner was receiving less than a just and reasonable return on property. In such a case, for purposes of determining base year net operating income, gross income shall be adjusted upward to twice the amount of adjusted base year operating expenses. 
(Ord. 856 N.S. § 1 (part), 1988) 
(Ord. No. 1929 N.S., § 2, 4-22-2009)  
5.36.290 - Determination of base year net operating income. 
A.  To determine the net operating income during the base year, there shall be deducted from the annualized gross income being realized on January 1, 1982, a sum equal to the actual operating expenses for calendar year 1981, unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the hearing panel that some other twelve consecutive month period is justified by reasons independent of the purpose of this article. In all cases, January 1, 1982, shall fall within the twelve-month period utilized in this chapter, except as provided in subsection B of this section. 
B.  In the event that the owner did not own the subject property on January 1, 1982, the operating expenses for 1981 shall be determined in one of the following manners, whichever the hearing panel determines to be more reliable in the particular case: 
1.  The previous owner's actual operating expenses as defined in subsection C of Section 5.36.260 of this article or, where unavailable; 
2.  Actual operating expenses for the first calendar year of ownership, discounted to 1981 by the schedule in Section 5.36.300 of this article. 
C.  In the event that a petition for rent increase involves less than fifty percent of the spaces in a mobile home park, the net operating income for the base year shall be determined only for the spaces affected by the petition. The net operating income for these spaces will be determined under the procedure outlined in Section 5.36.260. Should specific documentation not be available on individual spaces for the base year, the hearing panel shall make a reasonable determination of the net operating income. 
(Ord. 998 N.S. § 4, 1990: Ord. 856 N.S. § 1 (part), 1988) 
(Ord. No. 1929 N.S., § 2, 4-22-2009)  
5.36.300 - Increases in operating expensesAmounts permitted. 
Where scheduling of rent increase, or other calculations require projections of income and expenses, it shall be assumed that operating expenses, exclusive of property taxes and management expenses, increase at ten percent per year, that property taxes increase at two percent per year, and that management expenses are five percent of gross income. 
(Ord. 856 N.S. § 1 (part), 1988)  
5.36.310 - Allowable rent increases. 
A.  Upon filing of a petition by an owner, rent increases may be permitted such that the owner's net operating income will be increased at the rate of forty percent of the increase in the CPI over the base year. The increase in the CPI shall be calculated by dividing the most recently reported monthly figure at the time of filing of the petition by the monthly figure for February 1981 = (2/81 CPI = 260.5).

The chief of police, upon receipt of a written application for a permit, shall conduct an appropriate investigation to determine whether the permit should be issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Based on his or her investigation, the chief of police shall issue a permit if he or she finds that the operation proposed by the application complies with the applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the building, zoning, and health regulations of the city, and the applicant, and any employee of the applicant, has not been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, by final judgment, of any of the following:

H.  PermitDenialAppeal Procedures. 
1.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the chief of police with reference to the issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of a permit shall have a right to appeal. An appeal must be filed within fifteen days after the service of notice of decision to the applicant by the city. A letter of appeal must briefly state therein the basis for such appeal, together with a filing and processing fee as established by a resolution of the city council. 
2.  Upon receipt of such letter of appeal and fee, the city clerk shall set the matter for consideration by the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive. 
I.  PermitSuspension or Revocation. 
1.  The chief of police shall suspend any permit issued under this chapter if he or she finds any fact that would require an application for permit to be denied under Section 5.60.010 of this chapter or for any other violation of this chapter. In the case of such suspension, the chief of police shall serve the permittee with a written order of suspension which shall state the reasons therefor. The order shall be effective immediately if personally served, or forty-eight hours after the same has been deposited in the course of transmission in the United States Postal Service. Immediately upon such order becoming effective, the permittee shall cease all operations under the permit. 
2.  The order of suspension shall be deemed a revocation of the permit to which it relates unless the permittee, within fifteen days after its effective date, files an appeal from the order in the manner set forth in this chapter. Where an appeal is taken, the order shall be stayed pending a determination thereon by the city council. The determination shall be final and conclusive. 
J.  PermitPosting Required. Permits issued pursuant to this chapter shall be posted on the premises where the business or enterprise for which the permit is issued is conducted and shall remain so posted during the period the permit shall be in force.

Each and every adult business shall be operated in compliance with the standards set forth as follows:

B.  Advertising and Display. The city council finds that adult businesses should be conducted in a manner so as to not unduly impact nearby businesses or land uses. Therefore, signs, window displays and building painting and colors shall be restrained, not in garish colors or textures, in a manner similar to other businesses in the area, and shall not depict or advertise specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities nor specific products, instruments, devices or other merchandise in connection with specified sexual activities. Any advertisements, signs, displays of merchandise or any other exhibit depicting adult business activities placed within the interior of buildings or premises such as waiting areas, office area and other areas behind windows shall not show specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities. All such areas shall be arranged or screened to prevent public viewing from outside such buildings or premises. No outdoor loudspeakers or other outdoor sound equipment advertising or directing attention to an adult entertainment use are allowed. 
C.  Minors. No minor under the age of eighteen may be admitted to an adult business. The owner or manager of an adult business shall require a California driver's license or other equivalent identification from any patron who appears to be under age thirty. 
D.  Open Inspection. The police department and any other investigating officials of the city shall have the right to enter all areas which are open to the public in adult businesses from time to time during regular business hours, to make reasonable inspections to observe and enforce compliance with building, fire, electrical, plumbing, health regulations or provisions of this chapter. A warrant shall be obtained whenever required by law. This section applies to all areas of an adult business, including massage rooms, minitheater or peep shows and any other areas of the business. Notice of this right to enter shall be posted conspicuously in the lobby or other entrance of the building. 
E.  Security and Lighting. An on-site security program, including required interior and exterior lighting plans, shall be prepared and implemented and include, when directed by the chief of police, provision of on-site security personnel during all business hours, which security personnel shall be licensed in accordance with the California Business and Professions Code and Section 5.40.010 et seq. of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code.

D.  Notwithstanding subsections A through C of this Section, the administrator shall have discretionary authority to refrain from classifying a dog as potentially dangerous, even if the dog has engaged in the behaviors specified in subsections A through C of this section, if the administrator determines that the behavior was the result of one or more of the following circumstances: 
1.  The injury or damage was sustained by a person who at the time the injury or damage was sustained: was teasing, assaulting, abusing or tormenting the dog; was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the private property of the owner or person having a right to control the dog; or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.

3.  The dog was protecting or defending a person within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. 
4.  The injury or damage to a domestic animal was sustained while the dog was working as a hunting dog, or predator control dog on the property of, or under the control of its owner or the person having a right to control the dog, and the damage or injury was to a species or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the dog.

6.12.190 - Potentially dangerous dogsClassification procedure. 
A.  The administrator or his/her designate shall have authority to determine whether any dog has engaged in the behaviors or exhibits any of the characteristics specified in Section 6.12.180. This determination shall be based upon an investigation that includes the observations of and testimony about the dog's behavior or characteristics, including, but not limited to, the dog's upbringing and the owner's control of the dog. These observations and testimony can be provided by animal service officers or other witnesses who personally observed the animal's behavior or characteristics. The witnesses shall sign a written statement attesting to this behavior. 
B.  The administrator or animal service officer shall give the dog's owner written notice by certified mail or personal service of the dog's specified behavior or characteristics and the dog's classification as a potentially dangerous dog with the additional restrictions, as outlined in Section 6.12.200 of this title, applicable to that dog by reason of its classification. If the owner denies that the behavior in question occurred, the owner may request a hearing before the administrator which shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.32.080. The owner and any other persons having relevant evidence concerning the dog's behavior as specified in the written notice shall be allowed to present testimony. The administrator shall determine whether behavior or characteristics specified in Section 6.12.180 were exhibited or possessed by the dog in question. The administrator shall issue an order containing its determination, which shall be final. 
C.  Once the owner has received notice of the dog's classification as a Level 1, 2 or 3 potentially dangerous dog pursuant to subsection B of this section, the owner shall comply with restrictions specified in the notice until such time as the administrator's final decision is issued. Failure to comply with the specified restrictions pending the completion of all appeals shall be a violation of this chapter. Additionally, the administrator shall have authority to impound the dog pending completion of all appeals. 
D.  If the administrator finds that a dog has engaged in Level 3 behavior, the dog may be impounded pending completion of all appeals. If the administrator's final decision is that the dog engaged in Level 3 behavior, the dog's owner shall be liable for the cost of the dog's impoundment. 
E.  If there are no additional instances of behavior described in Section 6.12.180 within a thirty-six month period from the date of final designation as a Level 2 potentially dangerous dog, the owner may petition the administrator to remove or reclassify the dog's designation as a potentially dangerous dog Level 2. 
F.  The imposition of regulations pursuant to this section shall not prevent the administrator from also issuing a citation pursuant to Section 6.08.030. 
G.  Upon a conviction for a second violation of any provision of this title, the administrator or animal service officer may order impoundment of the dog.

The administrator shall adopt administrative rules establishing specifications for the required device or structure. The administrator may require that the dog's owner prove financial responsibility, including posting a bond or certificate of insurance in the amount of fifty thousand dollars, and may require the owner or person having a right to control the dog to attend dog obedience, or such other class as may be determined appropriate by the administrator, with the dog.

The leash must be attached to an escape-proof commercial quality walking harness which fastens securely across the shoulders and mid-chest encompassing the rib area and upper abdomen of the dog. No collar of any type or material will be sufficient to satisfy the above requirements. Level 2 potentially dangerous dogs shall not be leashed or tethered at any time to inanimate objects such as trees, posts or buildings. The muzzling device must be constructed so that it is impossible for the dog to remove it without human assistance. 
3.  Transportation of Level 2 potentially dangerous dogs shall only be in locked animal carriers equivalent in construction quality to those used by commercial air carriers. 
4.  No Level 2 potentially dangerous dog shall be left unconfined nor unattended in or about any motor vehicle.

6.  The administrator may require that the Level 2 potentially dangerous dog owner prove financial responsibility including posting a bond or certificate of insurance in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, and may require the owner or person having a right to control the dog to attend dog obedience, or such other class as may be determined appropriate by the administrator, with the dog. 
7.  A person owning or having charge of a dog classified as a Level 2 potentially dangerous dog shall post warning signs on the property where the dog is kept, in conformance with the provisions of Section 6.28.050. 
8.  To insure correct identification, all dogs that have been classified as Level 2 potentially dangerous shall be marked with a permanent identifying mark. The administrator shall adopt rules specifying the character, location and manner of this marking. The owner of the dog shall provide, at the owner's expense, at least two dated, colored photographs depicting a full frontal, facial view and one full side view clearly showing the color and approximate size of the dog. 
C.  Any dog that has been found to have engaged in Level 3 behavior as described in Section 6.12.180 shall be euthanized. 
D.  In addition to the normal licensing fees established by the city council, there may be an annual fee for dogs that have been classified as potentially dangerous. This additional fee set in resolution, shall be imposed at the time the license of the potentially dangerous dog expires and shall be payable at the time the license is renewed.

Any convicted felon who wishes to own, purchase, receive or have in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control a dog weighing more than twenty pounds under Section 6.28.100(C)(1) of this chapter, or a dog that the administrator designates as posing a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare if misused by a convicted felon under Section 6.28.100(C)(3) of this chapter, may apply for a prohibited dog permit to own, keep or maintain that dog. If there is probable cause to believe that a dog poses a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare if misused by a convicted felon, the dog may be impounded pending a determination made under this article and until any required permit is obtained. If the administrator designates a dog as posing a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare if misused by a convicted felon, written notice of this designation shall be mailed to the owner or person having a right to control the dog. The owner or person having a right to control the potentially dangerous dog must pay an application fee and apply for the prohibited dog permit within fifteen calendar days after the mailing of the written notice of designation. The administrator may deny a prohibited dog permit if he or she determines that the dog poses a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare, or may condition the issuance of the permit upon the permittee's written agreement to comply with conditions of ownership to be determined by the administrator. These conditions of ownership may include, but are not limited to, those found under Section 6.12.200 of this title. A prohibited dog permit may subsequently be revoked by the administrator if there is probable cause to believe that the convicted felon's continued ownership of the dog poses a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare.

Chapter 8.44 - SMOKING POLLUTION CONTROL 
 
8.44.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and a potential health hazard in outdoor settings. Studies have shown exposure to secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for several populations, including children, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Health hazards induced by exposure to secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory functions, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm. Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of reactions to secondhand smoke. Smoking is a potential cause of fires, and cigarette butts are a pervasive source of litter. 
B.  The city council of the city finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke by prohibiting smoking in places where people live, work, and play, and (2) to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of persons who smoke and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that, where these needs conflict, the need to breathe smoke-free air should have priority.

Chapter 9.13 - SOCIAL HOST 
 
9.13.010 - Findings. 
A.  Underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises is harmful to the underage persons themselves and a threat to the peace, health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare of the public. Underage persons, who have been consuming alcoholic beverages, are at greater risk to be in automobile accidents, to commit suicide, to be assaulted, and girls are at greater risk of sexual assaults. 
B.  Persons responsible for the occurrence of these types of gathering on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these parties. 
C.  Problems associated with gatherings involving underage persons drinking alcohol are difficult to prevent and deter. Police need an arsenal of tools to deal with the issue of underage drinking and its attendant problems. If persons are held civilly responsible by having to pay a significant fine for hosting a party where there is underage drinking, they will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such conduct at events held on property under their possession or control. Because the high median household income of residents of the city of Morgan Hill, the fine needs to be significant to have such a deterrent effect. 
D.  In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to these types of gatherings. The repeated return of police officers to the location of an event constitutes a drain of emergency personnel and resources, often leaving other areas of the city of Morgan Hill without police protection or with unreasonably limited protection. Responses to such gatherings also result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the city of Morgan Hill, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city of Morgan Hill by its taxpayers and residents. 
(Ord. 1850 N.S. § 1 (part), 2007)  
9.13.020 - Purpose. 
A.  To enforce laws prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons; 
B.  To protect public health, safety, general welfare and quiet enjoyment of residential property and properties neighboring one of these gatherings; and 
C.  To establish standards and controls of parties, gatherings or assemblages involving underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages on private property when such gatherings are determined to be a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare and require initial police response and return calls to the location to disperse uncooperative participants. 
(Ord. 1850 N.S. § 1 (part), 2007)

Title 12 - STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND PUBLIC PLACES  
Chapter 12.02 - STREET AND SIDEWALK DEVELOPMENT 
 
12.02.010 - City council findings as to need and purpose. 
In enacting this chapter, the city council of the city of Morgan Hill finds as follows: 
Since its settlement and until its incorporation, Morgan Hill was an agricultural community. Its street pattern was designed originally for light traffic. Since its incorporation in 1906, Morgan Hill has grown from a small town to a city of over twenty-five thousand persons. Land uses have changed from agricultural to residential, commercial and industrial. As a direct result, previously existing streets and highways are inadequate in width and development to provide acceptable service capacities to the community. Inadequate streets deny minimum standards for safe, convenient automobile and pedestrian travel within and without the city. The problem is aggravated because city development has not been contiguous nor centralized but peripheral. Consequently, more street development has been necessary to provide an adequate traffic circulation pattern. In addition, each development increases the traffic to and from that development so that development itself imposes ever-increasing traffic burdens on local streets and highways and upon available community resources. 
Funds to provide for street and highway development in a relatively new community have always been limited and are now even more restricted. Revenues from taxes are limited by law for general law cities such as Morgan Hill. Recent changes in the law have further restricted street and highway development through city's ability to finance street and highway development through bond measures. Available tax dollars must be shared with the other important community needs of police and fire protection, health and safety, parks and recreation and public administration. While financing of street improvements is available through assessment district proceedings, such proceedings are costly, time consuming and complex and their availability may depend upon the consent of landowners or citizens, which consent cannot always be obtained. 
Since a given development creates traffic which, in turn, creates the need for improved streets and highways, and since a given development directly benefits from improved streets and highways by being more accessible, the city council finds it is appropriate to require a contribution toward street improvement when a parcel of land develops, to help offset the burden the development creates and to compensate the community at large for the benefit the development receives. 
The city council finds that unless measures are taken to provide for the orderly and systematic increase in width, capacity and improvement of streets and highways when and as the development of land takes place, the economic welfare, public convenience and general prosperity of the community and its citizens will suffer. These provisions are, therefore, intended to define the requirements, policies and procedures for the acquisition of public right-of-way easements and for the construction of public improvements in connection with the development of land. It is intended to extend the basic requirements under the Subdivision Map Act and Titles 17 and 18 of this code to apply to land development in which no subdivision is involved. It is intended to fairly spread the cost of required public improvements upon abutting properties. It is intended to prevent the dissipation of the city's funds by preventing faulty or substandard installations. It is intended to help the city meet the important and competing demands for public service without unduly increasing the cost of government or the tax burden upon the taxpayer of the community. It is intended to protect the public safety, living standards and common welfare of the city and the citizens of Morgan Hill. 
This chapter is enacted to require any person who proposes to erect, construct, alter, enlarge, repair, move or maintain any building or structure for which any city permit is required on or upon any land adjacent to an unimproved street or who seeks to change the use of any land which includes or is adjacent to an unimproved street to improve or agree to improve that street as required by this chapter through the dedication of lands for street and public utility use and the installation of such of the following improvements including but not limited to, as may be necessary: curbs, gutters, driveways, sidewalks, storm drains, street paving, street lighting, medians, traffic signals, signing and striping, bus stops, street trees, walkways, landscaping, sewer lines, water lines, undergrounding existing overhead services and non-access facilities. In enacting this chapter, the city council intends that said improvement or agreement for improvement shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any permit required by the city.

(Ord. 1279 N.S. § 1 (part), 1996: Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.110 - Payment in lieu of dedication or improvement or both. 
A.  Requirement. Where a permittee seeks a development permit, and the city council determines (after notice, hearing and findings made in accordance with this chapter) that improvements should be deferred, the city council in its sole discretion may, as a condition precedent to the issuance of said development permit: 
1.  Require dedication of land from the permittee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and 
2.  Require payment from the permittee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in lieu of improvements. 
B.  Notice, Hearing and Findings. The requirement set forth in subsection A of this section shall not be imposed before: 
1.  The permittee has been given ten days' prior written notice (by certified mail or in person at the address shown on the development permit application) of the time, date and place for the hearing before the city council; and 
2.  A hearing is held before the city council; 
3.  The city council finds: 
a.  That the present installation of said improvements would impose a health or safety hazard, or 
b.  That the present installation of said improvements is uneconomical and that said improvement can hereafter be installed more efficiently and economically as a portion of a larger installation of improvements, or 
c.  The risk of deterioration of said improvement if presently installed and the need for maintenance and upkeep is such that either the permittee or city would benefit by deferring installation of said improvements, or 
d.  For other good cause as set forth in said findings. 
C.  Amount of Payment in Lieu of Improvement. The amount of payment required in lieu of improvement shall be equivalent to the cost of said improvements in accordance with a resolution of costs of improvements adopted by the city council. It shall be the duty of the director of public works to present to the city at least once each twelve months its calculation of the reasonable cost of improvements at that time in Santa Clara County as the basis for the review of said costs and the adoption and revision of any said resolution relating to said costs. Nothing herein contained, however, shall invalidate any action of the city council or invalidate the imposition of any charge upon a permittee under the provisions of this chapter for payment in lieu of improvements as a result of any failure on the part of the director of public works to present said costs to the city council to revise any resolution of costs once adopted. 
(Ord. 1279 N.S. § 1 (part), 1996: Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.115 - Deferral of payment of undergrounding utility in lieu fees. 
Payment of utility undergrounding in lieu fees, when authorized by the city council pursuant to Section 12.02.110, shall be as provided for in this chapter, except when a deferral is requested and certain conditions, as set forth by resolution of the city council, are met. 
(Ord. 1761 N.S. § 3, 2006)  
12.02.120 - Improvement preceding permits. 
A.  Intent. The city council finds and declares that in some instances the public welfare and convenience and the greatest economy and safety can be accomplished by the installation of improvements on unimproved streets prior to the time that an abutting property owner or owners shall seek a development permit. Such owners or their successors in title should be required to contribute their fair share to the street improvements in such areas (just as permittee who seek a permit prior to the installation of improvements are required to do) when their property develops or when they seek a development permit. 
B.  Payment to the City for Improvements. In instances where improvements have been installed in the city, it is the intent of the city council that as a condition precedent anyone requesting a development permit shall pay to the city such sum as the city, other property owner or other public entity on behalf of the city has paid to acquire the land and shall make payments to the city for the improvements which the city or other property owner or public entity has installed on the streets abutting or included in the property of the permittee. In the event that the Morgan Hill redevelopment agency has paid for improvements, infrastructure or rights-of-way, the reimbursement is not mandatory. The reimbursement may be waived upon approval of a request for waiver by the redevelopment agency. Improvements shall include but are not limited to all of the following improvements as required in the city standards which said unimproved street shall lack: curbs, gutter, driveways, sidewalks, storm drains, completed paving to curb, street lighting, medians, traffic signals, signing and striping, bus stops, street trees, walkways, landscaping, sewer lines, water lines, undergrounding existing overhead services and non-access facilities. Said payments shall be made at or before the time the permit is issued and shall be in addition to any other requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Procedure Where Partial Improvements Made. If the improvements installed by city or others prior to the issuance of the permit shall be less than the improvements required by or authorized to be required by this chapter, permittee shall make or agree to make such other improvements, all as required by this chapter. It is the intent of this chapter that a permittee who obtains his permit after improvements have been made by city or others in whole or in part shall be required to provide (in money or improvements or both) the equivalent of what he would have been required to provide had his permit predated the improvements. The provisions of this section are, therefore, not in derogation of any other provision of this chapter. 
Payment in lieu of improvements under this section shall be an amount equal to what the improvements cost at the time they were made. Said cost shall be computed under the resolution of cost of improvements adopted under Section 12.02.110(C) in force at the time the improvements were made; if there was no resolution of cost of improvements in force at the time improvements were made, costs will be computed in accordance with the resolution of cost improvements first adopted following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
D.  Acquisition of Land by City Before Its Dedication is Required. In the event city required land for right-of-way before said land shall be subject to dedication under this chapter, city may at its sole discretion, purchase said land or any interest in exchange for an agreement that the owner (and his successors in interest) shall not be required to make repayment for said land under this section and/or one or more of the improvements (or payment in lieu of said improvement or improvements) required by this chapter. This section is intended to authorize a land owner to transfer land to city in advance of the date the dedication thereof would be required under this chapter. In consideration of early transfer, city is empowered to waive the repayment for land and/or one or more of the improvements otherwise required by this chapter for the land or interest so transferred as may constitute equitable and just consideration for advance transfer. 
(Ord. 1279 N.S. § 1 (part), 1996: Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.130 - Credit for past work. 
Whenever the owner of a parcel of land under the jurisdiction of this chapter has paid for any of the improvements required by this chapter (by special assessment or otherwise) after the date of the city's incorporation, the extent of such improvements (at the estimated value thereof at the time the land was dedicated or the improvements were made) shall be credited against the obligation created by this chapter. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.140 - Application procedure. 
A.  Legal Description. A true and accurate legal description of the property to be developed along with a property sketch, plot plan or vicinity plan required for an accurate description of land to be dedicated shall accompany the application for approval to develop. 
B.  Time for Dedication and Improvement or Payment or Agreement in Lieu Thereof. Prior to the issuance of any development permit or the second reading of any rezoning ordinance, the permittee shall make such dedications and install such improvements as are required under this chapter or in lieu of improvements, shall make such cash payments as are required or execute such agreements and securities as are required. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.150 - Agreements. 
Prior to the issuance of a development permit or second reading of a zoning ordinance, if the permittee is not proceeding pursuant to subsection B of Section 12.02.140, the permittee shall execute an agreement with the city to install the improvements required by city pursuant to this chapter at the permittee's sole cost within such time as said agreement shall require. Said agreement shall contain such covenants and conditions as are required by the city, including, but not limited to, the following: 
A.  No work shall be undertaken by the permittee until all plans and specifications have been submitted to the director of public works and approved in writing; 
B.  All improvements shall be constructed under and subject to inspection by the director of public works; 
C.  The permittee shall pay the city's costs and expenses in connection therewith; 
D.  Completion of the improvements shall be prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the expiration of the agreement term, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.160 - Security for agreement. 
To assure the permittee's full and faithful performance of the agreement, the permittee shall concurrently file security for such sum as is sufficient to cover one hundred percent of the cost of said improvements and other costs and, in addition, such security as is sufficient to cover one hundred percent of all labor and materials costs required to construct the improvements. The amount of such security shall be determined by the director of public works and the form of such security shall be approved by the city attorney. Such security shall be one or more of the following: 
A.  A bond issued by a surety company authorized to transact a surety business in the state; 
B.  A letter of credit issued by a savings and loan institution or by a bank authorized to transact business in the state; 
C.  The deposit of cash funds in a savings account in any savings and loan or bank maintaining an office in Santa Clara County, with an assignment of said account to the city for payment upon said account; provided, further, that the permittee and the bank or savings and loan shall execute such written documents as shall be required by the city attorney and as shall be approved by him as to form to insure the availability of said sums upon demand to the city and provided further, that there shall be delivered to the city a certificate or passbook representing said account, together with said assignment, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney; 
D.  Cash or a cashiers check drawn upon a bank or savings and loan institution maintaining an office in Santa Clara County. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.170 - Release of security. 
No release of any security required under this chapter shall be made except upon the certification by the director of public works that work covered thereunder has been satisfactorily completed and upon approval of the city council, provided, however, that progress payments may be made to the permittee upon approval of the city council in accordance with the provisions of his agreement with the city. Said security or any portion thereof, may be retained by the city until the end of any express warranty or guarantee period provided for in the agreement secured or until any claim period established by law or agreement has expired. No interest shall be paid by the city upon any security deposited by the permittee with the city, any interest earned by the permittee from any bank or savings and loan institution upon an account assigned to the city (if not called upon to satisfy the permittee's obligations pursuant to his written agreement) shall be released to the permittee when the principal sum on deposit is released to the permittee. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.180 - Indemnification and reimbursement. 
In the event that the permittee shall fail to complete all improvement work in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or shall fail to pay for all labor and materials, all as required by this chapter, agreement or law, the city shall be entitled to resort to the security furnished by the permittee to complete said improvement work, pay for said labor and materials and pay for such other costs as shall have been incurred by the city. Resort to said security shall not preclude the city from proceeding against a permittee for breach of contract and damages for failure to provide improvement work, labor or materials or to pay other costs in excess of the amount of said security. 
(Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.190 - Exceptions. 
A.  The planning commission may recommend that the city council authorize conditional exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter provided that the following facts are found: 
1.  That there are special circumstances and conditions affecting the subject property; 
2.  That the exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the developer; 
3.  That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which said property is situated. 
B.  1.  In recommending such exceptions, the planning commission shall act to otherwise substantially secure the objectives of the regulations which exceptions are requested and shall act to protect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
2.  In recommending the authorization of any exception under the provisions of this section, the planning commission shall report to the city council its findings with respect thereto and all facts in connection therewith and shall specifically and fully set forth the exceptions recommended and the conditions designated. 
C.  Upon receipt of such report, the city council may approve the development permit with or without the exceptions and conditions recommended by the planning commission and with such other exceptions, if any, as the city council deems necessary to substantially secure the objectives of this chapter. 
D.  The improvement of any existing building or structure which does not increase the total floor area of such building or structure to an extent of twenty-five percent or more within any five-year period shall be excepted from application of the provisions of this chapter but this subsection is not applicable to the cases described in subsection G of this section. 
E.  In cases where the improvement of an existing building or structure or improvements does not increase the total floor area of such building to an extent of twenty-five percent or more within any five-year period but where such improvements during any twelve-month period exceeds fifty percent of the value of such building, the requirements of this chapter shall apply. 
F.  For purposes of this section, the value of a building, structure or improvement shall be determined to be the current market value thereof as determined by the director of public works. In determining said market value, the city shall consider the most recent appraised value as shown upon the records of the county appraiser as well as other appraisal data as the director of public works shall deem pertinent. In the event that the director of public works determines that the value exceeds fifty percent, the permittee shall receive written notice by mail, postage prepaid, and dispatched to the permittee at his address as shown upon his permit application, of such determination and shall be entitled to appeal such determination in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
G.  It is the intent of the city council that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the extension of an existing building or structure on the same or adjoining parcels as that on which an existing building or structure is located and to the installation of a new or additional building or structure on the same or on an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership and to the extension of an existing use to an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership. It is the intent of the city council that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to any land abutting on a street held in the same ownership as other land abutting on that street for which a development permit has been previously granted. 
H.  The conversion of an existing single family residence from a residential use to a primarily commercial use located on property within a CC-R zoning designation (i.e., central commercial-residential district) shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. This exemption shall expire three years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
I.  In cases where the commercial improvements of any existing building or structure located on property within a CC-R zoning designation increases the total floor area of such building to an extent of twenty-five percent or more but the increase in the total floor area is less than one thousand five hundred square feet within any ten year period, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply. This exemption shall expire three years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1636 N.S. § 1, 2003; Ord. 982 N.S. § 1 (part), 1990)  
12.02.200 - Relinquishment of dedication and improvement or payment in lieu thereof. 
A.  If the city council shall determine that land dedicated, improvements made or money contributed in lieu of improvements under and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall, in any given case, no longer be necessary because of a change in street plan lines, street plans or improvement requirements, and if the city council further determines that it is equitable and reasonable to do so, the city council shall be empowered to direct the conveyance by quit claim deed of said dedicated land and improvements and the refund without interest of any money paid in lieu of improvements to the present owner (at the time of said conveyance or refund) of the land adjoining the dedicated land. 
B.  The city council finds and determines that said conveyance and refund should be made to the present owner for the following reasons: to quit claim to one other than the present owner could leave the present owner's adjoining land without access and landlocked; subsequent owners receive the benefit of a prior owner's compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and therefore, subsequent owners should receive the benefit of any relinquishment by the city; presumably the cost of dedication and improvement is included in the price with the present owner paid to the prior owner; the tracing of title from present owner to prior owner or owners is costly, burdensome and time consuming and would often outweigh the value of property conveyed or the refund made; the intent of this chapter is that improvements, once made, run with the land and requirements under this chapter once met, need not be repeated on each change of ownership. 
C.  The city council finds and determines that no interest should be paid on refunds for the following reasons: as the city derives no benefit from improvements until they are made, the city should be entitled to retain any interest on payments in lieu of improvements to compensate the city for the inability to use the improvements. The city has not had the unlimited use of funds paid in lieu of improvements under the provisions of this chapter and therefore should not be required to make payment therefor in the form of interest. 
D.  As used in this section, the phrase "land adjoining the dedicated land" refers to the land out of which the dedication is made and which adjoins the dedicated land.

Any such permit, certificate or license issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.

The city attorney shall, upon the order of the city council, commence action or proceedings for the abatement and removal or enjoinment thereof in the manner prescribed by law.

This chapter shall be applicable to any development permit issued after the effective date of the ordinance codified herein, provided, however, that in computing requirements under this chapter for a given parcel of land, credit shall be given to a permittee for payments in lieu of improvements made by said permittee or his predecessor in interest prior to the effective date of this chapter.

12.32.010 - Council determinations. 
The city council finds and declares: 
A.  The existing and future trees and tree communities located in the city are a valuable and distinctive natural resource. The trees and tree communities of the city augment the economic base through agricultural production, encouragement of tourism and enhancement of the living environment. These resources are a major component of both the highly localized and area-wide environment. 
B.  The following environmental consequences are among those which could result from the indiscriminate removal or destruction of trees and tree communities in the city: 
1.  Modification of microclimates; 
2.  Change or elimination of animal habitat, possibly including habitats of endangered species; 
3.  Change in soil conditions, resulting in modified biological activity and erosion of soils; 
4.  Creation of increased susceptibility of flood hazards; 
5.  Increased risk of landslides; 
6.  Increased cost of construction and maintenance of drainage systems through increased flow and diversion of surface waters; 
7.  Degradation of the human habitat; 
8.  Loss of environmental benefits of trees in neighborhoods, such as noise reduction, oxygen replacement, carbon dioxide reduction, interception of particulates and aesthetic qualities; and/or 
9.  Potential for irreparable wind damage to adjacent trees. 
C.  The preservation and replacement of significant tree communities on private and public property is necessary to protect the natural beauty of the area, protect property values, and prevent undesirable changes in the environment. 
D.

An application for a waiver will be denied unless the city manager finds, based on the information provided in the application, supporting documents, or such additional information as may be requested, and on water use information for the property as shown by the records of the city or its agent, all of the following: 
a.  That the waiver does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other residents and businesses; 
b.  That because of special circumstances applicable to the property or its use, the strict application of this chapter would have a disproportionate impact on the property or use that exceeds the impacts to residents and businesses generally; 
c.  That the authorizing of such waiver will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent properties, and will not materially affect the ability of the city to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public interest; and 
d.  That the condition or situation of the subject property or the intended use of the property for which the waiver is sought is not common, recurrent or general in nature. 
4.  Approval Authority. The city manager must act upon any completed application no later than ten days after submittal and may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the waiver. The applicant requesting the waiver must be promptly notified in writing of any action taken. Unless specified otherwise at the time a waiver is approved, the waiver will apply to the subject property during the period of the mandatory water supply shortage condition. The decision of the city manager shall be final.

Title 14 - HOUSING  
Chapter 14.04 - INCLUSIONARY HOUSING 
 
14.04.010 - Findings. 
The City Council finds that: 
A.  Housing prices and rents in the city of Morgan Hill have increased at a significantly higher rate than general wages. The lack of affordable housing forces many residents to pay a very high percentage of their income for housing or to commute considerable distances, adding to air pollution and traffic congestion throughout Santa Clara County. The lack of affordable housing has made it more difficult to recruit workers, potentially affecting the economic vitality of the city. New housing developments do not provide an adequate supply of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
B.  Rental and owner-occupied housing in Morgan Hill has become steadily more expensive. Although Morgan Hill has historically met its regional housing needs allocation goals, in recent years, housing costs have escalated sharply, increasing faster than incomes. As a result, there is a severe shortage of adequate, affordable housing for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. 
C.  In order to meet the needs of Morgan Hill households, residential developments will need to provide housing for a variety of household types of a range of incomes and ages. The inclusionary housing ordinance codified in this title will substantially advance the city's interest in providing additional rental and ownership housing affordable to all income levels and dispersed throughout the city. 
D.  Continued new housing development that does not include housing for low- and moderate-income households will further contribute to the current shortage of affordable housing by reducing the small remaining supply of undeveloped land. 
E.  On February 18, 2015, the city council approved the city's housing element, a chapter of the general plan which includes strategies to build new housing to meet the full range of future community housing needs, including affordable and accessible housing. 
F.  Implementation of the inclusionary housing ordinance is a necessary part of the city's efforts to meet its regional housing needs allocation goals and obligations. Pursuant to the ordinance, at least fifteen percent of the units in a new housing development of two or more units will be required to be price or rent-restricted and available for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households. In some circumstances, developers will have an option to provide inclusionary units off-site or to pay an in-lieu housing fee. 
(Ord. No. 2278 N.S., § 1, 7-25-2018)  
14.04.020 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to further the city's efforts to require housing available to extremely low-income, very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income households. The housing element of the city's general plan implements the established policy of the state of California that each community should foster an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels. 
Providing the inclusionary units required by this chapter will help to ensure that part of Morgan Hill's remaining developable land is used to provide affordable housing to encourage an economically balanced community. Requiring builders of new market-rate housing to include some housing affordable to households at a range of incomes is consistent with the goal of fostering an adequate supply of housing for persons at all income levels and serves the goal of mixed-income housing. Furthermore, the production of inclusionary units is intended to assist the city in meeting its regional housing need allocation. 
The inclusionary housing ordinance is required in order to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare while preserving and enhancing economic diversity and inclusiveness within the city.

If the city or its designee maintains a list of, or otherwise identifies, eligible households, initial and subsequent occupants of inclusionary units shall be selected first from the list of identified households, to the maximum extent possible, in accordance with rules approved by the city manager or his or her designee. 
(Ord. No. 2278 N.S., § 1, 7-25-2018; Ord. No. 2288 N.S., § 3, 10-24-2018)  
14.04.070 - Alternatives. 
In lieu of building inclusionary units within a residential project, an applicant may propose to satisfy the requirements of this chapter by one of the following alternative modes of compliance, provided that the applicant includes such proposal in its application for the first approval of the residential project, and further provided that the criteria stated in the relevant subsection below are satisfied. 
A.  Rental Units in For-Sale Projects. Where owner-occupied inclusionary units are required by Section 14.04.040 of this chapter, an applicant may instead elect to construct as part of the residential project the same or a greater number of rental units, affordable to extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate-income households in the proportions and at the rents as prescribed in Section 14.04.030 of this chapter. Substitution of rental units shall be allowed under this subsection only if either: 
1.  The rental units are at least equal in number of bedrooms to the owner-occupancy units that would have been allowed, or 
2.  Any comparative deficiency in the number of bedrooms is compensated for by additional units and/or affordability to households with lower incomes. 
B.  Off-site Construction. An Applicant may propose to construct, or make possible construction by another developer, units that will not be physically contiguous to the market-rate units (or units that are physically contiguous to the market-rate units if the city determines this will provide greater public benefit). Off-site construction pursuant to this subsection shall be approved only if: 
1.  An inclusionary affordable housing agreement acceptable to the city manager or his or her designee that requires an equal or greater number of inclusionary units as required under Section 14.04.040 of this chapter is recorded; 
2.  Approval has been secured for the off-site units not later than the time the residential project is approved, and completion of the off-site units is secured by a requirement that certificates of occupancy for the related market-rate units will be issued after certificates of occupancy have been issued for the inclusionary units, provided that the time requirements set forth in this subsection for final inspections for occupancy for market-rate units may be modified to accommodate phasing schedules, model variations, financing requirements, or other factors, if the city determines this will provide greater public benefit; 
3.  The off-site units will be greater in number, larger, or will be affordable to households with lower incomes than would otherwise be required by Section 14.04.040 of this chapter; 
4.  Financing or a viable financing plan is in place for the off-site units; 
5.  If the off-site units receive any public assistance, the developer of the market-rate project will contribute economic value to the off-site units equivalent to the cost that would have been incurred to provide the required number of inclusionary units on-site in the residential project; and 
6.  The city may require that completion of off-site units shall be further secured by the developer's agreement to pay an in-lieu fee in the amount approved by city council in the event the off-site units are not timely completed. 
C.  Land Dedication. An applicant may pro-pose to dedicate without cost to the city, a lot or lots within or contiguous to the residential project, sufficient to accommodate at least the required inclusionary units for the residential project. An election to dedicate land in lieu of compliance with other provisions of this chapter shall be allowed only if: 
1.  The value of the lot or lots to be dedicated is sufficient to make development of the otherwise required inclusionary units economically feasible, and financing or a viable financing plan is in place for at least the required number of inclusionary units; and 
2.  The lot or lots are zoned for and suitable for construction of affordable housing at a feasible cost, served by utilities, streets, and other infra-structure; there are no hazardous materials present or other material constraints on development of affordable housing on the lot or lots; and land use approvals have been obtained as necessary for the development of the inclusionary units on the lot or lots. 
D.  In-lieu Housing Fee. 
1.  An in-lieu housing fee may be paid in addition to building or in-lieu of building as follows: 
a.  As provided in Section 14.04.040A, whenever application of the requirements of this chapter results in a fractional number of .49 or less of required inclusionary units. 
b.  For all other residential projects, upon determination by city council that payment of an in-lieu fee is preferred to building inclusionary units onsite, or one of the other alternatives described in Section 14.04.070A through C above, considering the following: 
i.  Whether the production of the proposed inclusionary units will fill a need in an affordable housing category or some other prioritized housing need area. 
ii.  Whether the proposed inclusionary units are in a category for which the city has already met its RHNA goal and therefore payment of a fee may be preferred. 
iii.  Whether there is a specific identifiable project that the city can support with the fees. 
iv.  Whether affordable units are appropriate in the specific project. 
2.  The initial in-lieu fee schedule shall be set by city council resolution or other action of the city council so that the fee amounts are not greater than the difference between: 
a.  The amount of a conventional permanent loan that an inclusionary unit would support based on the affordable rent or affordable sales price for the inclusionary unit; and 
b.  The estimated total development cost of a prototypical inclusionary unit. 
3.  The city council may annually review the fees authorized by this subsection by resolution, and may, based on that review, adjust the fee amount. For any annual period during which the city council does not review the fee authorized by this subsection, fee amounts shall be adjusted once by the city manager or his or her designee based on the construction cost index. 
4.  In-lieu fees shall be calculated based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. In-lieu fees shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits for market-rate units in a residential project. If building permits are issued for only part of a residential project, the fee amount shall be based only on the number of units then permitted. Where payment is delayed, in the event of default or for any other reason, the amount of the in-lieu fee payable under this subsection shall be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. 
(Ord. No. 2278 N.S., § 1, 7-25-2018; Ord. No. 2299 N.S., § 2, 3-20-2019)  
14.04.080 - Use of in-lieu fees. 
A.  All in-lieu fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into a separate account to be designated as the city of Morgan Hill housing in-lieu fee fund. 
B.  The in-lieu fees collected pursuant to this chapter, and all earnings from investment of such fees, shall be expended exclusively to provide or assure continued provision of affordable housing in the city through acquisition, construction, development assistance, rehabilitation, financing, rent subsidies, or other methods, and for costs of administering programs that serve those ends.

Such fees shall be payable by the property owner and shall be deposited into the city's housing in-lieu fee fund. 
(Ord. No. 2278 N.S., § 1, 7-25-2018)  
14.04.120 - On-site inclusionary housing incentives. 
A.  The developer of a residential project providing all required inclusionary units on the same site as the market-rate units may, at the developer's option and concurrently with the submittal of the affordable housing plan and the earlier of the zoning or planning permit application, submit a written request for one or more of the following on-site inclusionary housing development incentives: 
1.  Density Bonus. The residential project may receive a density bonus if the residential project includes affordable units in accordance with the threshold requirements for density bonus pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915 et seq. For residential projects qualifying for a density bonus pursuant to this subsection, the city shall, upon request of the applicant at the time of application for the first approval, authorize a density bonus in the amount specified in California Government Code Section 65915 et seq. unless such a density bonus would cause an adverse impact to the public health, safety and welfare, including but not limited to historic or natural resources, or the environment. The city shall not provide any other incentives or concessions, other than those listed in this Section 14.04.120, in addition to such density bonus unless otherwise required by law. 
2.  Reduction in Minimum Setback Requirements. The developer may request a reduction in the minimum setback requirements for the residential project, provided such reduction will not cause an adverse impact to the public health, safety and welfare, including, but not limited to, historic or natural resources, or the environment. 
3.  Alternative Unit Type. The developer may request to provide inclusionary units that are of a different unit type than the market-rate units to be constructed within the residential project; provided however, the inclusionary units shall have the same bedroom count in the same percentage distribution as the market-rate units. 
4.  Alternative Interior Design Standards. The developer shall provide the same amenities within the inclusionary units as provided in the market-rate units, but may request to provide different but functionally equivalent amenities for the inclusionary units; provided however, residents of inclusionary units shall have access to all common areas of the residential project equal to the access provided to residents of market-rate units.

Chapter 14.08 - IN-LIEU HOUSING FEES 
 
14.08.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Need for in-lieu housing fees. The city council has determined, based on the city's general plan including the housing element, and existing statutes and regulations of the state of California, that the in-lieu housing fee is needed in order to finance the preservation of the existing below market rate portfolio, the administration of the housing program, future affordable housing programs and new projects. 
B.  Consistency with City General, Specific and Master Plans. In establishing the in-lieu housing fee, the city council finds that it is consistent with the city's general plan, including the housing element and applicable specific plans and master plans. 
C.  The city of Morgan Hill residential development control system ("RDCS") awards competing developments points for construction of very low, low-income, and moderate-income housing or for the contribution of in-lieu housing fees to the housing in-lieu fee fund. 
D.  Since 1977, the city has amassed one of the largest below market rate ("BMR") property portfolios per capita in the state and established a BMR Program that provides ownership opportunities and affordability to very low, low-income, and moderate-income households. 
E.  In-lieu housing fees provide for the cost of administering the city's housing program, maintaining the BMR portfolio, as well as the creation and preservation of affordable units, as funding is available. 
(Ord. No. 2288 N.S., § 1, 10-24-2018)  
14.08.020 - Fee established. 
A.  There is created an in-lieu housing fee for new residential development for residential projects that are required or which volunteer to pay an in-lieu housing fee. 
B.  For-Sale Residential Projects Outside of Downtown. The in-lieu housing fee for "for-sale" residential projects outside of downtown for which there is a fifteen-percent inclusionary housing requirement is nineteen dollars and seventy cents per habitable square foot of the residential building area of market-rate housing. 
C.  For-Sale Residential Projects Within Downtown. The in-lieu housing fee for "for-sale" residential projects within the downtown for which there is a ten-percent inclusionary housing requirement is thirteen dollars and twenty cents per habitable square foot of the residential building area of market-rate housing. 
D.  Rental Residential Projects Outside of Downtown. The in-lieu housing fee for "rental" residential projects outside of downtown for which there is a fifteen-percent inclusionary housing requirement is twenty-nine dollars per habitable square foot of the residential building area of market-rate housing. 
E.  Rental Residential Projects Within Downtown. The in-lieu housing fee for "rental" residential projects within the downtown for which there is a ten-percent inclusionary housing requirement is fourteen dollars and fifty cents per habitable square foot of the residential building area of market-rate housing. 
F.  Basis for calculation of the In-Lieu Housing Fee. The city approves, adopts, and incorporates the summary report from Keyser Marston Associates (KMA), entitled "Summary of Per Square Feet In-Lieu Fee Amounts for Ownership Projects Equivalent to Range of On-site BMR Requirements, and Summary of Per Square Feet In-Lieu Fee Amounts for Rental Projects Equivalent to Range of On-site BMR Requirements for Morgan Hill" dated September 25, 2018. This establishes the value of the in-lieu housing fee, which is determined to be a fair and effective fee to maintain the BMR program. 
(Ord. No. 2288 N.S., § 1, 10-24-2018)  
14.08.030 - Applicability 
A.  The in-lieu housing fees are established for residential projects and will be incorporated into development agreements entered into after the effective date of this ordinance. 
B.  All collected in-lieu housing fees shall be used to finance the administration and implementation of affordable housing programs and projects within the city of Morgan Hill in support of the goals and objectives established in the city of Morgan Hill housing element. 
C.  The in-lieu housing fee per square foot resulting from a calculation of total livable space of the market rate project, excludes the garages and other non-habitable space when calculating the total square feet of the project. 
D.  The in-lieu housing fee will be paid by developers to satisfy their required contribution to the housing in-lieu fee fund. 
E.  Example calculations of in-lieu housing fee: 
1.  AmountNineteen dollars and seventy cents: Project has fifty-six market rate units. The average habitable square footage of each unit is two thousand square feet. The in-lieu housing fee contribution shall be: Nineteen dollars and seventy cents times fifty-six units times two thousand square feet equals two million two hundred six thousand four hundred dollars. 
2.  AmountThirteen dollars and twenty cents: Project has fifty-six market rate units. The average habitable square footage of each unit is two thousand square feet. The in-lieu housing fee contribution shall be: Thirteen dollars and twenty cents times fifty-six units times two thousand square feet equals one million four hundred seventy-eight thousand four hundred dollars. 
3.  AmountTwenty-nine dollars: Project has fifty-six market rate units. The average habitable square footage of each unit is two thousand square feet. The in-lieu housing fee contribution shall be: Twenty-nine dollars times fifty-six units times two thousand square feet equals three million two hundred forty-eight thousand dollars. 
4.  AmountFourteen dollars and fifty cents: Project has fifty-six market rate units. The average habitable square footage of each unit is two thousand square feet. The in-lieu housing fee contribution shall be: Fourteen dollars and fifty cents times fifty-six units times two thousand square feet equals one million six hundred twenty-four thousand dollars. 
F.  The in-lieu housing fee must be provided to the housing division in proportion to the market rate units being delivered prior to housing division signing off for occupancy. 
G.  Whenever application of the inclusionary housing requirements results in a fractional number of required inclusionary units of forty-nine hundredths or less, the applicant may elect to pay the in-lieu housing fee instead of developing the inclusionary unit. 
H.  Example calculation of fractional in-lieu housing fee: the fractional BMR threshold is five-tenths to encourage the construction of new BMR units. The program applies the fractional fee to fractional requirements less than five-tenths of a unit. Project has fifty-six total units; average size of market rate units is two thousand square feet. To receive maximum RDCS points the fifty-six-total unit project has committed to a fifteen-percent affordable commitment, fifty-six units times fifteen percent equals eight and four-tenths. This equates to eight on-site BMR units and a fractional fee payment due for the ".4" units. First, calculate the implicit in-lieu fee: fifty-six units times two thousand square feet times nineteen dollars and seventy cents per SF = an implicit in-lieu fee of two million two hundred six thousand four hundred dollars. From that implicit in-lieu fee, calculate the per BMR unit cost: two million two hundred six thousand four hundred dollars divided by eight and four-tenths equals two hundred sixty-two thousand six hundred sixty-six dollars per BMR unit cost. The fractional payment owed for this project.

The city council finds that: 
A.  The city of Morgan Hill residential development control system ("RDCS"), awards competing developments points for provision of low-income and moderate-income housing and housing for the elderly. 
B.  Since 1977, the city has amassed one of the largest below market rate ("BMR") property portfolios in the state and established a BMR program that provides ownership opportunities and affordability to low-income and moderate-income households. 
C.  The excess sales proceeds value in each below market rate property represents a bona fide city asset that subsidizes the affordability for each BMR property owner ("owner") and is a vehicle that can be used to renovate older units, build new units, and help pay for program administration. 
D.  The city recognizes that the declaration of restrictions, which secures the excess sale proceeds, is a covenant that runs with the land by and between the BMR property owner and the city of Morgan Hill that restricts the right of use or enjoyment and should be enforced judicially. 
E.  A program and program guidelines are essential to maintain integrity of the BMR program and compliance therewith and these guidelines and policies will be updated from time to time to address challenges and changes in the market and economic environment. 
F.  In order to respond to program needs, the city manager or his or her designee should be empowered to approve BMR program guidelines and BMR agreements. 
G.  In order to ensure compliance with the city's program the program must be actively administrated. The administration of the program can be achieved by city staff and/or an outside administrator. The city is empowered to delegate the day-to-day management of the program to a third-party administrator. 
H.  Either in-house or third-party administration is vital to ensure program integrity and continued affordability of below market rate properties. 
I.  In response to the dissolution of the city's redevelopment agency, schedules have been put in place to pay for the costs of services funded by former redevelopment agency funds.

14.12.130 - Below market rate (BMR) program development standards. 
A.  Development standards approved by city council are designed to guide the implementation and construction of the below market rate (BMR) units, to ensure quality homes are built consistent with the character of the neighborhood and providing guidance for the inclusion of materials and amenities within each unit. 
B.  The BMR development standards are generally intended to apply to development projects where proposed BMR inclusionary units will be constructed by a developer constructing a market rate project, but these BMR development standards would not typically apply to publicly financed one hundred percent affordable housing projects. 
C.  The city may consider instances where deviations from these standards may be appropriate for the provision of inclusionary or affordable units. The designated reviewing body shall make a finding to this effect prior to any approval or any issuance of permits (i.e., community development director, planning commission, or city council). This includes, but is not limited to: 
1.  When the deviation results in a greater number of affordable units and/or broaden affordability levels to help the city implement its housing element and achieve RHNA goals. 
2.  Developments in which a market rate developer is partnered with an affordable housing developer in which the market rate developer develops only the market rate units while the affordable housing developer develops the affordable units, some of the BMR program development standards, such as the distribution throughout the project requirement, may not apply or may need to be adjusted. 
D.  Any updates to the BMR program development standards shall be approved by the city manager or the city manager's designee from time to time as needed and serve as amendments to the BMR program development standards that will be published online and made available to the public.

Such code shall be and become the City of Morgan Hill Building Code regulating the erection, construction, alteration, repair, relocation, demolition, occupancy, use, height, area, and maintenance of all buildings and structures and certain equipment therein specifically regulated. The provisions of said code shall provide for the issuance of permits and certificates of occupancy, the collection of fees thereof, and penalties for violation of such code. 
At least one copy of the City of Morgan Hill Building Code has been deposited in the office of the city building official and is available for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.020 - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "building code" and may be cited as such. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.030 - Organization, enforcement, fees, and inspections. 
The organization, enforcement, fees, and inspections shall comply with the 2016 California Building Code. The building official shall use the building valuation data from the building standards publication for "cost per square foot." For residential construction, two general classes, one for "average" and one for "good" construction, will be used by the building official with adjustments for special architectural or structural features and location of the project. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.040 - Additions, amendments, and deletions. 
The following provisions of the California Building Code and California Residential Code shall be added, amended, or deleted as follows: 
A.  The following sections in the California Building Code are amended by this chapter: 1505.1.4, 310.1, 2308.6.5, 1907A.1, and 1808A.1. 
B.  The following section in the California Residential Code is amended by this chapter: R902.1.4. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.050 - Sections 1505.1.4 and R902.1.4 amendedConstruction of roof coverings in wildland-urban interface areas. 
A.  Section 1505.1.4 of the 2016 California Building Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1505.1.4 Roofing requirements in a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area. The entire roof covering of every existing structure where more than 50 percent of the total roof area is replaced within any one-year period, the entire roof covering of every new structure, and any roof covering applied in the alteration, repair or replacement of the roof of every existing structure, shall be a fire-retardant roof covering that is at least Class A. 
B.  Section R902.1.4 of the 2016 California Residential Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
R902.1.4 Roofing requirements in a wildland-urban interface fire area. The entire roof covering of every existing structure where more than 50 percent of the total roof area is replaced within any one-year period, the entire roof covering of every new structure, and any roof covering applied in the alteration, repair or replacement of the roof of every existing structure, shall be a fire-retardant roof covering that is at least Class A. 
C.  Findings. 
1.  The council finds and declares that the areas as defined in the open space and conservation element of the general plan are considered a hazardous fire area and that it is, therefore, necessary to establish special minimum fire-resistive requirements in these areas for the protection of life and property. The fire hazard of untreated wood roofs has long been recognized by the National Fire Protection Association. The city's foothills cause many problems for firefighters including long response times, inadequate water supply, and unlimited fuel. The city is in a region which experiences high winds and low humidity during summer months. Winter rains promote the growth of grass and brush. This vegetation presents heavy dry fuel loads in the summer months. These conditions are conducive to the ready ignition, propagation, and spread of grass, brush, and structure fires. Fog, heavy rains, mud slides, and earthquakes are other common occurrences which negatively affect the ability of the city's public safety resources to respond to emergency situations. The topography of Morgan Hill has hillside homes on each side of the city, causing long response time for safety equipment. The city is in a Category D seismic activity classification. Many traffic corridors, such as Highway 101 and Monterey Road, Union Pacific Railroad, and related bridges, underpasses, and crossings are subject to obstruction in the event of an earthquake, traffic accident, hazardous material spill, or other disaster. 
2.  Any of the above factors could quickly exhaust the fire department's resources and prevent the assistance of mutual aid resources. Therefore, Class A roofing would provide the fire protection needed through this amendment. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.060 - Building over utility easements. 
It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, construct, or maintain any building, garage, carport, storage shed, or other similar building over or within the boundary of any public easement. "Public utility easement" as used in this section includes any easement for a gas line, water line, storm drainage line, or buried or overhead electrical or telephone lines. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.070 - Section 310.1 amendedSingle-room occupancies (SRO). 
A.  Section 310.1 of the 2016 California Building Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
310.1 Residential Group R. The SRO unit shall have a living room of not less than 150 square feet (13.9m2) of superficial floor area. An additional 100 square feet (9.3m2) of superficial floor area shall be provided for each occupant of such SRO unit in excess of two. 
The SRO unit shall be provided with a separate closet. 
The SRO unit may be provided with a kitchen sink, cooking appliance and refrigeration facilities, each having a clear working space of not less than 30 inches (762 mm) in front. Light, ventilation and emergency egress conforming to this Code shall be provided. 
Every building shall be provided with at least one water closet. Every hotel or subdivision thereof where both sexes are accommodated shall contain at least two separate toilet facilities which are conspicuously identified for male and female use, each of which contains at least one water closet. 
Exception: Hotel guest rooms may have one unidentified toilet facility. 
Additional water closets shall be provided on each floor for each sex at the rate of one for every additional ten guests, or fractional part thereof, in excess of ten. 
Every SRO unit shall be provided with a kitchen equipped with a kitchen sink; however, that single room occupancy living unit facilities and single room occupancy residential hotels may contain partial kitchen facilities so long as a sink is provided and laundry facilities and kitchen facilities are provided on each floor accessible from a public hallway. 
Every SRO unit and every lodging house shall be provided with a bathroom equipped with facilities consisting of a water closet, lavatory and either a bathtub or shower; however, that single room occupancy residential hotels may contain partial bathroom facilities. If individual bath facilities are not provided, common bath facilities must be provided as follows: 
Where private water closets, lavatories and baths are not provided there shall be provided on each floor, for each sex, at least one water closet and lavatory and one bath, accessible from a public hallway. Additional water closets, lavatories and baths shall be provided on each floor for each sex at the rate of one for every additional ten guests or fractional number thereof in excess of ten. Such facilities shall be clearly marked for "men" or "women." As an alternative, adequate unisex facilities may be provided. Each sink, lavatory and either a bathtub or shower shall be equipped with hot and cold running water necessary for its normal operation. 
When SRO units are required by state law to be accessible or adaptable, appropriate sections of state law for access requirements must be followed. 
B.  This amendment is made pursuant to the authority set forth in California Health and Safety Code Section 17958.1. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.080 - Section 2308.6.5 amendedAlternate bracing (gypsum board and Portland cement). 
A.  Section 2308.6.5 of the 2016 California Building Code, which allows the use of gypsum board and Portland cement for wall bracing, is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
2308.6.5 Alternative Bracing. The use of gypsum board and Portland cement is not allowed in the City of Morgan Hill. 
B.  Findings. The city is in a Category D seismic activity classification. Gypsum wallboard and exterior Portland cement plaster have performed poorly during California seismic events. Shear values for gypsum wallboard and Portland cement stucco contained in the code are based on monodirectional testing. It is appropriate to eliminate the use of these materials until cyclic loading tests are performed and evaluated. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.090 - Section 1907A.1 amendedMinimum slab provisions. 
A.  Section 1907A.1 of the 2016 California Building Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1907A.1 General. The minimum thickness of concrete floor slabs supported on base rock shall not be less than 3-1/2" thick. The slab shall be reinforced with not less than six inches by six inches ten-gauge wire mesh or an approved alternate installed at mid height of the slab over 4" of approved base or as designed by a licensed professional engineer. 
B.  Findings. To avoid damage due to soil expansion, shrinkage and seismic activity which causes damage to concrete slab flooring throughout the city, imposing the above requirements eliminates the need for a soils report for some small projects. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)  
15.08.100 - Section 1808A.1 amendedFoundations. 
A.  Section 1808A.1 of the 2016 California Building Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1808A.1 General. A minimum of one top and one bottom continuous bar of 1/2" diameter reinforcing steel shall be required in all continuous concrete or masonry bearing foundations of Group R residential occupancies. Other occupancies shall be based on design. 
B.  Findings. The city is within a very active seismic area and local soil conditions can be highly expansive (clay soils). Damage to plain concrete footings is extremely expensive to repair, in contrast to the nominal expense of providing footing reinforcement. Footing reinforcement is also necessary to help prevent damage due to shrinking and swelling during seasonal drying and wetting conditions. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 1, 11-2-2016)

4.  Fails to comply with such an order as affirmed or modified by the city council or by a court of competent jurisdiction, within the time fixed in this chapter. 
B.  The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable time. 
C.  The application of the above penalty shall not be held to prevent the enforced removal of prohibited conditions.

(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 2, 11-2-2016)  
15.12.040 - Additions, amendments, and deletions. 
The following provisions of the 2016 Electrical Code shall be amended or deleted: 
A.  The following sections of the 2016 California Electrical Code are amended by this chapter: Article 334.12. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 2, 11-2-2016)  
15.12.050 - Article 334.12 amendedUses not permitted. 
A.  Article 334.12 of the 2016 California Electrical Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
Article 334.12 Uses Not Permitted. Type NM or NMC. Type NM and NMC cables shall not be used: (1) in any dwelling or structure exceeding three floors above grade; (2) as service-entrance cable; (3) embedded in poured concrete; or (4) in any non-residential occupancy. For the purpose of this article, the first floor of the building shall be that floor that has 50 percent or more of the exterior wall surface area level with or above finish grade. One additional level that is the first level and not designated for human habitation and used only for vehicle parking, storage, or similar use shall be permitted. 
B.  Findings. Morgan Hill is in an active seismic zone and has experienced two large seismic events in the past twenty-five years. Structural damage to commercial buildings in the business community was severe; electrical wiring within these commercial buildings was severely damaged, causing fire and creating electrical shock hazards to the occupants. Requiring that all electrical building wiring be protected in an approved electrical raceway as described in the California Electrical Code will minimize fire and life safety hazards to the occupants and rescue personnel caused by damaged exposed electrical wiring.

15.20.010 - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "plumbing code" and may be cited as such. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.020 - Adoption of the 2016 California Plumbing Code. 
There is hereby adopted by reference that certain code known and designated as the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 5, further described and referred to as the 2016 California Plumbing Code published by the California Building Standards Commission and based on the Uniform Plumbing Code&reg;, 2015 Edition, prepared by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. The adoption of said code shall include those sections requiring enforcement by the local building department as mandated by the State and as further amended by the City of Morgan Hill with provisions intended to address local climatic, geologic, and topographic conditions, as permitted by state law. Such code shall be and become the Morgan Hill Plumbing Code, regulating plumbing and drainage systems, house sewers, private sewage disposal, drainage systems, and prescribing conditions under which such work may be carried on within the city and providing for the issuance of permits and the collection of fees therefore. 
At least one copy of the city plumbing code has been deposited in the office of the city building official and is available for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.030 - Scope, organization, fees, and inspections. 
The scope, organization, enforcement, fees, and inspections of the 2016 California Plumbing Code must comply with those set forth in the 2016 California Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.040 - Amendments and deletions. 
The following provisions of the 2016 California Plumbing Code shall be amended or deleted: 
A.  The following sections of the California Plumbing Code are amended by this chapter: 604.3, 608.2, 609.3, 710.1 and 1002.1 - 1002.3. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.050 - Section 604.3 amendedCopper tube. 
A.  Section 604.3 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
604.3 Copper tube. Copper tube for potable water piping shall have a weight of not less than type "L." 
B.  Finding. Due to water hardness in the city, type "L" copper shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.060 - Section 608.2 amendedPressure regulators. 
A.  Section 608.2 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
608.2 Excessive Water Pressure. An approved type pressure regulator preceded by an adequate bypass strainer shall be installed and the pressure reduced to fifty-five pounds per square inch or less for all occupancies. 
Provision shall be made to prevent pressure on the building side of the regulator from exceeding main supply pressure. Each such regulator shall be accessibly located and shall have the strainer readily accessible for cleaning without removing the regulator or strainer body or disconnecting the supply piping. 
B.  Findings. Due to the topography of Morgan Hill, water supply tanks are located on top of local hills, causing high water pressure in the system. This velocity of water causes water pipes to deteriorate faster than normal. With this problem, requiring pressure regulators to areas in excess of fifty-five psi provides protection to each structure of pipe breakage and therefore necessitates this amendment. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.070 - Sections 609.3 amendedUnder concrete slab. 
A.  Section 609.3 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
609.3 Under Concrete Slab. Water piping shall not be installed in or under a concrete floor slab within a building without prior approval of the Building Official. 
B.  Findings. 
1.  Most of the surface soils in Morgan Hill are relatively young and unconsolidated sedimentary materials formed from a wide variety of parent materials. The varying chemical composition, degree of weathering, and the relatively acid environment have created soils of varying types, which are peculiarly corrosive in nature. 
2.  Much of the surface soil in Morgan Hill is characterized by peculiarly high expansivity (i.e., shrink-swell behavior) and low bearing strength. There are two types of expansive soils in the area: 
a.  The organic silty clays which are the recent bay muds; and 
b.  The plastic silty clays which weather from the shale found in the hills surrounding Santa Clara Valley. 
3.  The local climate is characterized by markedly delineated rainy and dry seasons, which tend to maximize the volume changes occurring within the soil. 
4.  Areas of the city have hard water, which may be corrosive to ferrous pipe. 
5.  The groundwater table is unusually high in many places. 
6.  Morgan Hill is a seismically active region. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.080 - Section 710.1 amendedBackflow protection. 
A.  Section 710.1 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
Section 710.1 Backflow Protection. Drainage piping serving fixtures which have flood level rims less than twelve (12) inches (304.8 mm) above the elevation of the next upstream manhole and/or flushing inlet cover at the public or private sewer system serving such drainage piping shall be protected from backflow of sewage by installing an approved type backwater valve. Fixtures above such elevation shall not discharge through the backwater valve, unless first approved by the Building Official. 
B.  Findings. The local topography includes mountainous and foothill areas with intermittent steep slopes. The City of Morgan Hill is located in a seismically active area, which increases the likelihood of breakage of building sewers and laterals, leading to an above average potential of sewage back-up into buildings without adequate protection. 
(Ord. No. 2221 N.S., § 4, 11-2-2016)  
15.20.090 - Sections 1002.1, 1002.2, and 1002.3 amendedVents and traps. 
A.  Section 1002.1 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1002.1 Vent Pipes. In all new installations to buildings and in all existing installations to buildings where the outlet of a trap for a plumbing fixture is installed or located at an elevation which is less than two feet from the rim of the nearest manhole uphill from the point of connection of the building sewer to the lateral sewer, approved types of trap, vent, and cleanout shall be installed in the building sewer at a point as close as possible to the building being served. 
B.  Section 1002.2 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1002.2 Fixture Traps. The installation shall include a back-water overflow device with 4" plastic two-way cleanout. In lieu of a two-way cleanout, a combination Wye and 1/8 bend with cleanout plug brought to grade may be installed, provided the main building drain is in a straight line with an exterior cleanout plug at grade on the opposite end of the main building drain line. 
C.  Section 1002.3 of the 2016 California Plumbing Code is hereby amended to read in its entirety: 
1002.3 Change of Direction. Every existing installation which includes a plumbing fixture trap outlet which is less than two feet from the rim of the nearest manhole uphill from the point of connection of the building sewer to the lateral sewer is hereby declared to be dangerous, unsanitary, and a menace to life, health and property. Whenever it shall come to the attention of the inspector that such an installation exists, the inspector is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require that such plumbing outlet be immediately plugged or capped or that the equipment described in the preceding paragraphs in this section be installed immediately. 
D.  Findings. The changes or modifications in the requirements of the 2016 California Plumbing Code, as set out in this section, are necessary because many parts of the city are susceptible to flooding. The possibility of this undue strain upon existing city waste collection facilities and the attendant hazard of contamination of the city's water system requires that additional safeguards be imposed upon the installation of plumbing fixtures.

Chapter 15.30 - REPLACEMENT HOUSING 
 
15.30.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the replacement housing ordinance codified in this chapter is to assist in developing and preserving affordable housing opportunities for low and moderate income households residing in the downtown area of Morgan Hill. The replacement housing ordinance codified in this chapter is intended to ensure that assistance is provided to households whose existing homes are replaced with higher density housing or commercial development by requiring developers to provide relocation assistance to low and moderate income households whose homes are demolished, removed or converted to another use. Additionally, developers who demolish a residential unit occupied by low or moderate income households with new, higher density residential units will be required to provide one replacement unit on-site affordable to low-income persons. If a property contains two residential units which will both be demolished, the owner will be required to provide only one replacement unit. Commercial development replacing existing residential units occupied by low or moderate income housing will mitigate this impact through the payment of fees in lieu of replacement residential units. These fees will be paid into a special housing fund to provide low/moderate residential housing. 
A.  The city council finds and declares that the ordinance codified in this chapter will serve the public purposes of preserving and increasing the supply of affordable housing for low-income households. 
B.  The city council finds and declares that this chapter will prevent displacement of low and moderate income households from the city and will ease the burden of relocation through the provision of relocation benefits. 
C.  The city council finds that the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter will not have a significant, substantial or adverse effect on the physical environment of the community because enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter involves no deviation from the general plan and no change in the present use of any property within the city. Further environmental review will be performed for individual projects as they are proposed to be constructed. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
A.  "Affordable rent" means monthly rent that does not exceed twenty-five percent of the monthly gross income of a household at the upper income limit of the applicable income category. 
B.  "Gross income" means the total gross income for federal income tax purposes of all adult members of a household who intend to permanently occupy the household. 
C.  "Low-income household" means a household with a gross income that does not exceed eighty percent of the median income. 
D.  "Median income" means the median gross yearly income for a household in Santa Clara County, adjusted for household size, as published by the state of California in Title 25, California Code of Regulations Section 6932 (or any successor code section), as periodically revised. 
E.  "Moderate-income household" means a household with a gross income that is greater than eighty percent of median income that does not exceed one hundred twenty percent of median income. 
F.  "Monthly gross income" means one-twelfth of the gross income as defined in subsection B. 
G.  "Residential unit" is any unit occupied as the primary place of residence of a household, regardless of zoning classification or permissible use of the building of which it is a part. 
H.  "The downtown neighborhood" means the areas within the designated outline shown on the boundaries map of the replacement housing program attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and incorporated herein by this reference. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.030 - Program Boundaries Map incorporated by reference. 
A map entitled "Program Boundaries Map, Replacement Housing Program" is incorporated herein by this reference and made a part of this chapter. This map shall be available for public inspection at the City Hall under the same terms and conditions as other public documents. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.040 - Applicability. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to residential rental units located in the downtown neighborhood which are occupied by either a low-income household or a moderate-income household. 
B.  For purposes of this section, a residential dwelling unit shall be considered occupied by a low or moderate income household if a low or moderate income household currently occupied the unit, or has occupied the dwelling unit within six months prior to the date of submission of the application for increased residential density development or a change to commercial use. 
C.  For purposes of this section, a residential dwelling unit shall be considered occupied by a low or moderate income household if a low or moderate income household occupied the unit within one year of the date of application for increased residential density development or a change to commercial use where substantial evidence exists that the household was evicted or the tenancy was terminated by the landlord, including constructive eviction caused by harassment or failure to repair and maintain the residential unit for the purposes of avoiding the requirements of this section. Termination of tenancy by the owner or owner's agent within one year prior to the application, for any cause other than nonpayment of the rent, or damage to the premises, shall create a rebuttable presumption that the household was evicted for purposes of avoiding the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.050 - Assistance to be providedResidential units replaced with new residential units. 
As a condition of approval for existing residential units in the downtown area to be replaced with new residential units of higher density, the owner is required to assist the existing low or moderate income households by providing temporary relocation assistance during demolition and construction of new units, and providing the first right of refusal for an on-site replacement housing unit to replace the previously existing units when construction is completed. The replacement housing units shall remain affordable for the longest feasible time but no less than that period of time required by regulations adopted by the redevelopment agency for use of housing moneys. If redevelopment funds are used, the new replacement unit shall remain affordable for the duration of land use controls of the city's redevelopment plan. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.060 - Assistance to be providedResidential units converted to or replaced with another use. 
As a condition of approval for existing residential units in the downtown area to be converted or replaced with use other than residential, the owner shall be required to provide relocation assistance to the existing tenants so they can move to suitable and affordable housing. Relocation assistance shall consist of all reasonable moving expenses (up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty dollars per household) and assistance in locating decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing. At a minimum, the owner will be required to provide up to twelve months of assistance to the tenant in an amount which equals the reasonable increase in rent and utility costs, not to exceed a maximum total payment of four thousand two hundred dollars per household. Additionally, the owner shall pay into a special housing fund to be established, fees to be set by resolution of the city council, which fees shall be used for the purpose of developing and constructing low and moderate income housing. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.070 - Notice requirements. 
A.  The property owner must provide a minimum of sixty days' advance notice in writing to the tenants of tenants' need to vacate the unit for demolition or conversion. Said notice shall inform the tenants of their options in terms of housing assistance. A sample "Notice to Tenants" containing the required information will be available as an appendix in the Rules and Regulations maintained pursuant to Section 15.30.090 to implement this chapter. 
B.  Notice under subsection A shall be given to all tenants residing in the dwelling unit at the time the application for demolition or conversion is made as well as to those tenants who occupied the dwelling unit within six months prior to the date of application but who have since moved. Additional notice will be required to be provided to any tenants who live in the unit within one year of the date of application but who are determined by the city to have been evicted for the purposes of avoiding the program requirements under this chapter. 
C.  The property owner shall make every reasonable effort to locate former tenants as required under subsection B and provide them with the required notice. The property owner shall maintain written documentation that efforts have been made to locate former tenants who might benefit from this chapter. 
(Ord. 1861 N.S. § 8 (part), 2007: Ord. 913 N.S. § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.30.080 - Relocation/replacement loans. 
Any redevelopment housing funds available to the city will be made available to property owners who are required to provide both relocation assistance and replacement housing to tenants. Under the terms to be established by the redevelopment agency, loan funds will be available and shall be secured by the property on which replacement units are built or on the property to be converted to another use.

The letter shall also indicate how many points the applicable project will achieve in each category and/or level of LEED certification, and shall include the contact information of the potential qualified sustainable building professional that will ensure that the plans meet the sustainability standards outlined in this chapter. The letter shall also commit to compliance with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Title 24, part 6). 
B.  Building Permit Documentation: Upon submittal of an application for a building permit, any applicable project shall include the most current sustainable building project checklist unless another version of the checklist was previously approved by a planning entitlement (excluding sustainable checklists used at the time of residential control development system allotment commitment). The application must also contain all necessary documentation to clearly demonstrate compliance with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6). 
If the project requires plans, the sustainable project checklist shall be incorporated with the building plans on a separate plan sheet and shall indicate in the general notes or individual detail drawings the measures to be used to attain the sustainability standards defined in this chapter and the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6), reflecting any changes proposed since the planning entitlement phase (if a planning entitlement was required.) 
Applicants are encouraged to consult with a qualified sustainable building professional before submitting plans and/or applying for a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 1953 N.S., § 2, 10-7-2009; Ord. No. 1966 N.S., § 1, 12-16-2009; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.65.045 - Review of documentation. 
A.  Approval: Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the building division shall certify with an approval letter that the project meets the minimum standards for compliance (or meets point level allowed under the exceptions provisions of this chapter) and that the plans (if submitted) reflect the points in the sustainable building project checklist. No building permit shall be issued until the permitting documentation has been approved under this section or unless an exemption has been granted under the hardship and infeasibility section of this chapter. 
B.  Non-approval: If the building division determines that the permitting documentation is incomplete or fails to indicate that the applicable project will meet the minimum standards of compliance in this chapter, the building division shall either: 
1.  Return the permitting documentation to the applicant marked "denied," including a statement of reasons for the denial; or 
2.  Return the permitting documentation to the applicant marked "further explanation required" and detail the additional information needed. 
C.  Resubmission: If the permitting documentation is returned to the applicant, the applicant may re-submit the permitting documentation with additional information as may be required or may apply for an exemption under the hardship and infeasibility section of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1953 N.S., § 2, 10-7-2009; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.65.050 - Compliance. 
A.  Building Inspections, Verification and Occupancy: The building division inspection staff or other qualified professionals retained by the city shall verify that the sustainable building measures indicated in the approved permitting documentation are being implemented at the foundation inspection, framing inspection, or other as needed inspections, and prior to final inspection/issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
Throughout each inspection stage, the applicant shall be required to provide evidence of compliance to the building division to satisfy the requirements of the minimum standards for compliance in this chapter. This information shall include, but is not limited to: 
1.  Any documentation that would be required by the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6) and the LEED or the GreenPoint rated system for certification. The applicant may be required to provide supporting information from qualified professionals (e.g. civil engineer, electrical engineer, Title 24 consultant, commissioning agent, etc.) to certify compliance with each point on the checklist. 
Applicants with projects that are registered with the U.S. Green Building Council are encouraged to submit proof of registration and provide online access to the U.S. Green Building Council's website to the building division in order to easily monitor the documentation submittals by the applicant; 
2.  Documentation that verifies incorporation of the design and construction related credits specified in the project approval; 
3.  Any additional information that the applicant believes is relevant to determining that a good faith effort has been made to comply with this chapter. 
B.  Substitution of Credits: During the compliance review, flexibility may be exercised by the sustainable building compliance officer to substitute approved points with other points in the LEED &reg; and GreenPoint rating systems. Substitution shall occur only at the request of the applicant. Any substitution credits shall not result in reduced minimum category point requirements within a sustainable building project checklist or required points established in a development agreement. The sustainable building compliance officer may at no time approve a project that fails to comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6). 
C.  Non-Compliance: If, as a result of any inspection, the building division determines that the project does not or is unlikely to comply with the sustainability measures in the approved permitting documentation and/or plans, a stop-work order may be issued if the sustainable building compliance official determines that continuation of construction activities will jeopardize the project's ability to meet the required sustainability standard. The stop-work order shall remain in effect until the sustainable building compliance official determines that the project will be brought into compliance with the approved permitting documentation and this chapter. 
D.  Final Determination of Compliance: Prior to the scheduling of a final building inspection for an applicable project, the building division shall review all documentation submitted by the applicant and determine that the project has demonstrated compliance with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6) and whether the applicant has achieved the minimum standards for compliance set forth in this chapter; or demonstrates that measures are in place to assure compliance not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection; or the applicant has made a good faith effort, as defined below, to comply. 
If the building division determines that the applicant has met the minimum requirements of this chapter for the project, the final building inspection may proceed, provided the project has received approval of all other inspections required by the building official. If the building division determines that the required sustainability standard has not been achieved based on the provisions of this chapter, the sustainable building compliance official shall find one of the following: 
1.  Good Faith Effort to Comply: At a minimum, all aspects of the proposed project must comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6). An applicant must submit a written request to the sustainable building official for approval of a good faith effort to comply. The granting or denial of the good faith effort to comply shall be provided to the applicant in writing within thirty days of the applicant's written request by the sustainable building compliance official. If a good faith effort to comply is granted, the final building inspection may proceed. 
Determination of a good faith effort to comply shall be made separately for each incomplete item on the sustainable building project checklist. Granting of a good faith effort to comply does not preclude the need for the applicant to comply with the other items on the sustainable building checklist, such as meeting minimum category point requirements within the checklist. However, the sustainable building compliance official shall, at minimum, verify that the project as a whole will still demonstrate compliance with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6) assuming all incomplete items are never completed. 
The sustainable building compliance official shall determine that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter when finding that at least ninety percent of the required sustainability credits have been achieved and either: 
i.  Measures are in place to assure full compliance not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection; or 
ii.  The incomplete measures involve sustainable building materials and technologies that are no longer available or not yet commercially available, and the applicant will comply by incorporating other measures not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection; or 
iii.  The cost for the incomplete sustainable building measure or documentation is disproportionate to the overall cost of the project, and the applicant will comply by incorporating other measures on the checklist not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection. That is, the cost for the sustainability measure or documentation exceeds three percent of the total cost of construction. The building division shall verify the construction costs. The applicant shall be responsible for providing documentation, such as, but not limited to, invoices and estimates from at least three separate sources, to support their positions. 
The applicant shall submit evidence that the sustainability measure(s) will be in compliance not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection and may be required to submit a deposit/bond to the building division. The sustainable building compliance official will determine the amount of deposit/bond required based on the cost of the sustainability measure(s). 
The applicant shall be responsible for submitting documentation or contacting the building division for an inspection when the sustainable building measure(s) is in place within one year of the date of final inspection approval. If the applicant complies within the one year timeframe, the deposit/bond shall be released in full to the applicant. If the applicant fails to complete measures within the allotted timeframe, the deposit shall be used to enhance the city's sustainable building program. 
2.  Non-Compliant Project: If the sustainable building compliance official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter or if the applicant fails to submit the necessary documentation within the required time period for associated inspections and plan reviews, or if the sustainable building compliance official determines that the project will not comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6), then the project shall be deemed non-compliant. The final inspection and approval for the project shall be withheld. A final inspection shall not take place until the applicant has implemented equivalent alternate measures approved by the sustainable building compliance official; or the applicant has been granted an exception under the provisions of this chapter. 
E.  The sustainable building compliance official shall have the responsibility to administer and monitor compliance with the sustainable building requirements set forth in this chapter and to grant good faith efforts to comply, exceptions and exemptions from the requirements, where so authorized. 
F.  Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be listed as a condition of approval on any design review permit or other discretionary permit approval, and on the building plans for building permit approval for any applicable project. 
(Ord. No. 1953 N.S., § 2, 10-7-2009; Ord. No. 1966 N.S., § 1, 12-16-2009; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.65.055 - Exceptions. 
If an applicant believes circumstances exist that make it a hardship and/or not feasible to complete up to ten percent of the required points defined in the minimum standards for compliance section of this chapter and the applicant can demonstrate to the sustainable building compliance official that the project will comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6) without these points, then the Sustainable Building Compliance Official may authorize a maximum of ten percent of the required points to be waived based on one of the following findings: 
1.  There is a lack of commercially available sustainable building materials and technologies to comply with the project's scope of work; or 
2.  The project's scope of work does not allow for enough sustainable checklist points without interfering with other areas outside the project's scope of work. 
3.  The cost to utilize sustainable building practices, technologies and/or provide documentation exceeds three percent of the project's construction cost. The project's construction costs shall be verified by building division staff. The applicant may be required to provide evidence to the Building Division, such as but not limited to, invoices and estimates from three different sources for each sustainable building measure(s) that the applicant believes is contributing to over three percent of the construction cost. The applicant is still required to obtain points that would equate up to three percent of the total construction costs. 
The applicant must apply in writing to the sustainable building compliance official for an exception and shall indicate the circumstances that create a hardship or make it infeasible to fully comply with this chapter. Determination of exception shall be made separately for each item on the sustainable building project checklist that the exemption applies to. Granting of an exception to comply for one or more items does not preclude the need for the applicant to meet required and minimum category point requirements within the checklist. As necessary, projects that are subject to development agreements shall apply for a development agreement amendment to modify the project's sustainability commitments. At no time shall an exception be granted which may cause a proposed or permitted project to fail to comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6). 
The decision of the sustainable building compliance official shall be provided to the applicant in writing within thirty days of applicant's written request. If an exception is granted, the applicant shall be required to comply with this chapter in all other respects. 
If the sustainable building compliance official determines that it is reasonably possible for the applicant to fully meet the requirements of this chapter or that granting a specific exception might result in a failure to comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6), the request shall be denied and the sustainable building compliance official shall notify the applicant in writing within thirty days of the applicant's written request. The project and compliance documentation shall be modified to comply with this chapter prior to further review of any pending planning or building application. 
(Ord. No. 1953 N.S., § 2, 10-7-2009; Ord. No. 1966 N.S., § 1, 12-16-2009; Ord. No. 2095 N.S., § 2, 11-20-2013)  
15.65.060 - Hardship or infeasibility exemption. 
At the time of applying for a building permit, if an applicant believes that circumstances exist that make it a hardship or infeasible to meet the requirements of this chapter, the applicant may request in writing to the sustainable building compliance official an exemption of one or more items on the sustainable building project checklist. The applicant shall indicate the maximum threshold of compliance that is feasible for the project; and circumstances that create a hardship or make it infeasible to fully comply with this chapter. As necessary, projects that are subject to a development agreement shall apply for an amendment to modify the project's sustainability standards. The sustainable building official shall have the authority to grant or deny an exemption based on one of the following, however, at no time shall an exemption be granted which may cause a proposed or permitted project to fail to comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6): 
1.  There are not enough sustainable building measures available within the sustainable building project checklist that are compatible with the project's scope of work; or 
2.  There is a lack of commercially available sustainable building materials and technologies to comply within the project's scope of work; or 
3.  The project is or within a non-conditioned building. Non-conditioned spaces that are attached to condition spaces are not eligible to apply under this finding; or 
The decision of the sustainable building compliance official shall be provided to the applicant in writing within thirty days of applicant's written request. 
Granting of Exemption: If the sustainable building compliance official determines that it is a hardship or is infeasible for the applicant to fully meet the requirements of this chapter based on the information provided, the sustainable building compliance official shall determine the maximum feasible threshold of compliance reasonably achievable for the project which complies with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6). If an exemption is granted, the applicant shall be required to comply with this chapter in all other respects and shall be required to achieve the threshold of compliance determined to be achievable by the sustainable building compliance official. 
Denial of Exemption: If the sustainable building compliance official determines that it is reasonably possible for the applicant to fully meet the requirements of this chapter or that granting the requested exemption would potentially cause the project to fail to comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standard (Title 24, part 6), the request shall be denied. The project and compliance documentation shall be modified to comply with this chapter prior to further review of any pending planning or building application.

Chapter 15.80 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
 
15.80.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Governmental Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Morgan Hill adopts the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Morgan Hill are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  When floodplains are developed without taking appropriate precautions, flood heights, frequencies, and velocities increase, causing a greater threat to humans, damage to property, destruction of natural floodplain functions and adverse impacts to water quality. 
C.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the city of Morgan Hill to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide, or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either:

This report is submitted annually or biennially as determined by the administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
"Building": See "structure." 
"Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)" means the comment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective Base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The letter does not revise an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM), it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be recognized by FEMA. 
"Crawlspace" means the enclosed area contained inside the foundation walls and below the habitable floor of a structure. Crawlspaces having the lowest floor two feet or less below grade level on all sides shall not be considered a basement.

"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
"Floodplain administrator" is the city official appointed by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1 (Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures, 2008), Technical Bulletin 3 (Non-Residential Floodproofing - Requirements and Certification, 1993), and Technical Bulletin 7 (Wet Floodproofing Requirements, 1993), and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto. 
1.  "Dry floodproofing" means floodproofing measures that are designed to prevent floodwaters from entering a structure. Dry floodproofing techniques may include, but are not limited to, installation of closure and sealants, watertight walls, small floodwalls or levees, flood shields, and watertight doors. 
2.  "Wet floodproofing" means floodproofing measures that minimize damage to a structure and its contents from floodwater that is allowed into the structure. 
"Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
"Flood-related erosion area" or "flood-related erosion prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage. 
"Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
"Floodway encroachment lines" means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps. 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Sections 15.80.240, 15.80.245, and 15.80.250, Variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., city council that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Sections 15.80.240, 15.80.245, and 15.80.250, Variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure," for floodplain management purposes, means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on the city's master list of historic structures, provided this local inventory is consistent with state-approved or certified historic preservation programs as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Letter of map revision (LOMR)" means FEMA's modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), or both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the FIRM or FBFM, and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report. 
"Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F)" means FEMA's modification of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. See "basement" definition. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to the applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
1.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.80.160.C.3; 
2.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.80.160.A; 
3.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.80.160.B; and 
4.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.80.170. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale; also see "existing manufactured home park or subdivision." 
"Market value" means the current estimated fair market value of a structure, excluding the current estimated fair market value of the land on which the structure is located and the current estimated fair market value of any landscaping, and any detached accessory structures on such land. The current tax assessed value of the structure as provided by the county tax assessor's office shall be used as the market value of the structure where the cost of the proposed improvement to the structure does not exceed forty-five percent. In the event the cost of the improvement to the structure exceeds forty-five percent of the current tax assessed value of the structure, the market value shall be determined from an independent appraisal prepared by a qualified professional appraiser using a building cost estimating method recognized by the building construction industry, which shall be reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
"Mixed-use structure" means any structure that has only nonresidential uses in areas of the structure at or below the base flood elevation, but has residential uses in areas of the structure above the base flood elevation with access to residential uses dry floodproofed. 
"Mudslide" means a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. 
"Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
"New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after June 18, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 18, 1980; also see "existing manufactured home park or subdivision." 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One-hundred-year flood, or "100-year Flood": See "base flood." 
"Principal structure" means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Sections 15.80.240, 15.80.245, 15.80.250, Variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway": See "floodway." 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Repetitive loss" means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area": See "area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means: 
1.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or 
2.  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
"Substantial improvement or substantially improved" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure taking place during a five-year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. For each structure, the five-year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that structure subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of any structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

15.80.060 - Applicability. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for the city of Morgan Hill dated December 1979 and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs) dated June 18, 1980, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs, and FBFMs are on file at the city of Morgan Hill's Development Services Center located at 17575 Peak Avenue, Morgan Hill, CA 95037. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.080 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the term of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions.

15.80.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city engineer or his or her designee is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permit applications to determine whether: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Morgan Hill; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by city staff. 
C.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.80.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer any section in this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
All new developments located in an area without a base flood elevation specified on the FIRM shall provide the floodplain administrator with a proposed base flood elevation. A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995, and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto. 
At the discretion of the floodplain administrator, the applicant may be required to provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations and floodway boundaries for the development proposal. The applicant shall be responsible for the peer review costs associated with the floodplain administrator's review of the flood analysis. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  In alteration or relocation of a watercourse within the city of Morgan Hill: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: 
Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 15.80.160.C.1 and Section 15.80.190 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.80.160.C.2 (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential and mixed-use structures); 
3.  Certification required by Sections 15.80.160.C.3 (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.80.180.A (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.80.200.B (floodway encroachments); 
6.  Reports required by Section 15.80.210 (mudflow standards); 
7.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to FEMA. 
F.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.80.150. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.80.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure city's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.150 - Appeals. 
The city council shall hear and decide appeals pursuant to Section 15.80.250 when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the floodplain administrator by an applicant on an official city application form accompanied by a fee, as established by resolution of the city council, within ten calendar days of the determination which is the cause for the appeal. The appeal application shall contain all grounds for the appeal and shall include a statement of the specific facts and all documentation regarding the appeal. 
When an appeal has been filed, the floodplain administrator shall prepare a report on the matter, including all of the application materials submitted, and schedule the matter for city council hearing within 90 days of receiving the appeal.

2)  A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the above requirements or be dry floodproofed. For guidance on below-grade parking areas, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 6 (Below-Grade Parking Requirements, 1993), and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto. 
b.  Detached garages and accessory structures. 
1)  "Accessory structures" used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in Section 15.80.050, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood elevation, provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements: 
i.  Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited storage; 
ii.  The portions of the accessory structure located below the base flood elevation must be built using flood-resistant materials; 
iii.  The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement; 
iv.  Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation; 
v.  The accessory structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions in Section15.80.200; and 
vi.  The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of floodwaters in accordance with Section15.80.160.C.3. 
2)  Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 15.80.160. 
6.  Crawlspace construction. This sub-section applies to buildings with crawlspaces up to two feet below grade. Below-grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. 
a.  The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered engineer; 
b.  The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1 (Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures, 2008) and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto; 
c.  Crawlspace construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; 
d.  Portions of the building below the base flood elevation must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the base flood elevation; and 
e.  Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated a minimum of one foot above base flood elevation or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. 
f.  Requirements for all below-grade crawlspace construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following: 
1)  The interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in figure 3 of FEMA Technical Bulletin 11 (Crawlspace Construction for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas, 2001);

1.  Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.180 - Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development. 
A.  All new subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
1.  Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood elevations (BFEs). 
2.  Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures and pads on the final plans. 
3.  If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the floodplain administrator: 
a.  Lowest floor elevation. 
b.  Pad elevation. 
c.  Lowest adjacent grade. 
B.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
C.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
D.  All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.190 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within a special flood hazard area (SFHA) on the city's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within a special flood hazard area (SFHA) on the city's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Section 15.80.190.A will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the city building inspector and/or the floodplain administrator to be properly elevated.

(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.200 - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones AE and A1-30, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Morgan Hill. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other development unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in the base flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If subsections A and B of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.80.160, 15.80.170, 15.80.180, 15.80.190, 15.80.195, 15.80.200, 15.80.210, and 15.80.220. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.205 - Engineered fill. 
All proposed developments with engineered fill within a special flood hazard area (SFHA) shall follow the guidelines for ensuring that structures built on fill are reasonably safe from flooding. See FEMA Technical Bulletin 10 (Ensuring that Structures Built on Fill In or Near Special Flood Hazard Areas are Reasonably Safe From Flooding, 2001), and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.210 - Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the: 
1.  Type and quality of soils; 
2.  Evidence of groundwater or surface water problems; 
3.  Depth and quality of any fill; 
4.  Overall slope of the site; and 
5.  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that: 
1.  A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
2.  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
3.  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and 
4.  Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.220 - Flood-related erosion-prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community. 
B.  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
C.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
D.  Within flood-related erosion-prone areas, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront, or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designed according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.240 - Variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
A.  Variances Requiring City Council Approval. Requests for a variance shall be submitted in writing to the floodplain administrator by an applicant on an official city application form accompanied by all required documentation and a fee, as established by resolution of the city council. 
When a variance request has been filed, the floodplain administrator shall prepare a report on the matter, including all of the application materials submitted, and schedule the matter for city council hearing within 90 days of receiving the variance request. 
B.  Administrative Variances. The floodplain administrator shall approve or deny an application requesting an administrative variance after receipt of a complete application. Administrative variances may only be granted to existing structures with substantial improvements to allow the structure to deviate from certain higher standards in this chapter that exceed the minimum National Flood Insurance Program standards. Requests for an administrative variance must demonstrate that complying to the higher standards will pose a financial burden and/or will conflict with the city's architectural or aesthetic requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.245 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.80.120, 15.80.140, 15.80.160, 15.80.170, 15.80.180, 15.80.190, 15.80.195, 15.80.200, 15.80.205, 15.80.210, and 15.80.220 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances do not need to be issued for any "accessory structures" (as defined in Section 15.80.050) within a special flood hazard area. All accessory structures shall meet the standards in Section 15.80.160.C.5. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means that the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted by the city council shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Santa Clara County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
The applicant will be required to indemnify and hold harmless the city for any incident which may result from the issuance of the variance. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2261 N.S., § 2, 9-27-2017)  
15.80.250 - Appeal board. 
The city council shall act as the appeal board and shall hear and decide the appeals and non-administrative requests for variances from the requirements in this chapter. The appeal or non-administrative variance request shall be considered by the city council at a public hearing to be held, noticed and conducted in accordance with the provisions in California Government Code Sections 65905(b), and 65091. Consideration shall be limited to the evidence and matters presented in the first instance to the floodplain administrator and to the specific grounds of the appeal or variance; provided, however, that the city council may, by motion duly passed, elect in its discretion to grant a hearing de novo. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing cause why the action appealed from should be altered, reversed or modified, or why the variance should be granted. The decision of the city council on the appeal or variance request shall be final and shall be effective on the date the decision is rendered. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 15.80.050 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.80.050 - see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.80.050) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.80.245.A and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter, and as permitted by California Government Code Section 65909.

Sections:  
Article I. - General 
 
17.38.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
A.  This chapter is enacted to establish requirements and procedures for the control and approval of the conversion of mobile home parks to community mobile home park, mobile home park condominium, and non-mobile home park uses. By their nature, mobile home park conversion projects differ specifically from other types of projects. The unique status of such projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may lead to conditions of mismanagement, neglect, and blight that impact upon the public health, safety, welfare, and economic prosperity of the city of Morgan Hill. Such projects may conflict with the policies of the city of Morgan Hill to provide a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and location of housing and to maintain the supply of mobile home housing for low and moderate income persons and families. To ensure that such problems are avoided in both short- and long-term, it is the express intent of the council of the city of Morgan Hill to treat mobile home park conversion projects differently from other projects, and to establish rules and standards regulating such projects in the city of Morgan Hill. 
B.  This chapter is enacted to ensure that approval of proposed conversions is consistent with policies and objectives of the city of Morgan Hill, particularly the following: 
1.  To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community; 
2.  To facilitate resident ownership of mobile home parks, while recognizing the need for maintaining an adequate inventory of rental space within mobile home parks; 
3.  To provide a reasonable balance between mobile homes and other types of housing; 
4.  To inform prospective conversion purchasers about the physical conditions of the structures and land offered for purchase; 
5.  To reduce and avoid the displacement of long-term residents, particularly senior citizens, the disabled, those who are of low income, and families with school-age children, who may be required to move from the community due to a shortage of replacement mobile home housing.

Chapter 17.50 - VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS 
Sections: 
 
17.50.010 - Citation and authority. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the state of California (hereinafter referred to as the Vesting Tentative Map Statute), and may be cited as the vesting tentative map ordinance. 
(Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.01), 1985)  
17.50.020 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act (Map Act) and the subdivision ordinance of the city (Title 17 of this code). Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the subdivision ordinance shall apply to the vesting tentative map ordinance. 
B.  To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.02), 1985)  
17.50.030 - Consistency with general plan. 
No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by the zoning ordinance (Title 18 of this code) or other applicable provisions of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.03), 1985)  
17.50.040 - Definitions. 
A.  "Vesting tentative map" means a tentative map that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map" at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 17.50.060 and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Furthermore, vesting tentative map refers to a map which meets the requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 66424.5 and Section 66452 of the Subdivision Map Act. When the city approves or conditionally approves a vesting tentative map, that approval shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect on the date the city has determined that the application for approval of the vesting tentative map is complete pursuant to Section 65943 of the Government Code. 
B.  All other definitions set forth in the subdivision ordinance are applicable. 
(Ord. 1143 N.S. § 54, 1993; Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.04), 1985)  
17.50.050 - Applicability. 
A.  Whenever a provision of the Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the subdivision ordinance, requires the filing of a tentative map or a tentative parcel map, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
B.  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
(Ord. 1477 N.S. § 1, 2000; Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.05), 1985)  
17.50.060 - Filing and processing. 
A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the subdivision ordinance for a tentative map except as provided in this section: 
A.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map." 
B.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed a subdivider shall also supply the following information: 
1.  A statement that site, architecture and landscape plan approval has been granted, or that application for site, architecture and landscape plan approval and plans have been filed which will be concurrently processed with the vesting tentative map for all buildings to be constructed on lots within the boundary of the vesting tentative map; 
2.  A statement that the vesting tentative map is consistent with the current zoning of the land, or an application has been filed for a zone amendment which will be processed concurrently with the vesting tentative map. If a conditional use permit is required, such permit shall be processed prior or concurrently with the vesting tentative map; 
3.  A tentative utility plan indicating the location of all public utilities and facilities including, but not limited to, facilities for water, sewer, electric, gas, cable TV and street lighting to be installed to serve the subdivision and any facilities which currently exist within the boundary of the subdivision; 
4.  The height, size, location, preliminary or conceptual architectural plans and use of all buildings to be constructed within the subdivision; 
5.  Plans for all site development, including, but not limited to, grading, drainage facilities and miscellaneous structures, prepared by a registered civil engineer in accordance with city standards and approved by the director of public works; 
6.  Required approval letters from other agencies where applicable and feasible; 
7.  When required by the community development department, an economic analysis including analysis of the market for the subdivision; 
8.  Landscape plans, including planting and irrigation details and drawings and specifications as prepared by a licensed landscape architect or contractor satisfactory for review by the director of community development; 
9.  Geological studies in such form as acceptable to the director of public works and the chief building official, which shall include detailed soils reports, seismic analysis, bank stabilization, and other factors pertinent to the particular site location; 
10.  Specific information on the uses to which the proposed buildings will be put; 
11.  Flood control information and statements showing compliance with flood hazard regulations; 
12.  A tree preservation plan. If there are no trees on the site, a statement to that effect should appear on the vesting tentative map. The tree preservation plan shall accurately identify all existing trees as species, trunk size and dripline. Trees that are proposed for removal shall be marked "TO BE REMOVED." Any provisions for tree preservation, transplanting, or new planting shall be identified; 
13.  As determined by the director of community development, a uniform sign program identifying locations of signs; 
14.  The director of community development may request, and the applicant shall promptly furnish, information as may reasonably be necessary to enable the director to evaluate the vesting effect which would follow from approval of the map. 
C.  All vesting tentative map submittals must be accurate and complete, and must satisfy all requirements of the community development department.

17.50.070 - Fees. 
Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required by the subdivision ordinance for the filing and processing of a tentative map. 
(Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.07), 1985)  
17.50.080 - Expiration.

17.50.090 - Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map. 
A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 17.50.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. All of such final maps must be recorded within the time period set forth in Section 17.50.080 or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire for those parcels for which final maps are not timely recorded; 
2.  The initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days from the date a complete application is filed; 
3.  A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section expires. The request for extension shall be submitted, in writing, to the secretary of the planning commission. The planning commission shall review any request for extension and submit a recommendation to the city council. An extension may be granted for a maximum of one year. The city council shall deny a request for extension unless it finds that changes to any city ordinances, policies, or standards that were adopted subsequent to the time of filing the vesting tentative map are not necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare; 
4.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (C)(1)(3) of this section, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of the permit, or any extension of that permit. 
D.  Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of the project covered by a single vesting tentative map, the one-year initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. The initial time period shall be automatically extended by any time used by the city for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if the time used by the city to process exceeds thirty days from the date that a complete application is filed. At any time prior to the expiration of the initial time period provided by this section, the subdivider may apply for a one-year extension. If the extension is denied by the planning commission, the subdivider may appeal the denial to the city council within ten days of receiving written notice. If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during periods of time specified herein, the rights of vesting conferred by Section 66498.1 of the Subdivision Map Act shall continue until expiration of that permit or any extension of that permit granted by the local agency. The provisions of this subsection apply only to the extent permitted in a signed development agreement, if applicable in a residential subdivision. 
(Ord. 1477 N.S. § 5, 2000; Ord. 1143 N.S. § 55, 1993; Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.09), 1985)

17.50.100 - Development inconsistent with zoningConditional approval. 
A.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city shall deny such a vesting tentative map if the city finds the vesting tentative map to be inconsistent with zoning of the property or proposed zoning ordinance which is being processed concurrently with the vesting tentative map. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding subsection A of Section 17.50.090, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
B.  The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in subsection C of Section 17.50.090. 
(Ord. 1477 N.S. § 6, 2000; Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.10), 1985)

Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies and standards described in subsection A of Section 17.50.090 and Section 17.50.100, and the city may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law. 
(Ord. 751 N.S. (VIII-2-13.11), 1985)  
17.50.115 - Failure to obtain site and architectural approval. 
The city shall deny a vesting tentative map application if site, architecture and landscape plan (site review) approval has not been granted for the subdivision. If the subdivider filed a complete application for site review approval concurrently with filing the vesting tentative map application and final action has not been taken on the site review application, the subdivider may request that the city defer action on the vesting tentative map application until after final action has been taken on the site review application, provided that the subdivider agrees to an extension of any periods within which the city is legally required to act on the vesting tentative subdivision map application. 
(Ord. 1477 N.S. § 7, 2000)  
17.50.120 - Tentative map approvals based on standards in effect. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided, in determining whether to approve or disapprove an application for a vesting tentative map, for which a development agreement has been signed, the city shall only apply those ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the date that the city has determined the application to be complete pursuant to Section 65943 of the Government Code. 
B.  Subsection A shall not apply to applications for vesting tentative maps for which the city has, before determining the applications to be complete pursuant to Section 65943, done both of the following: 
1.  Initiated proceedings by way of ordinance, resolution or motion; 
2.  Published notice in the manner prescribed in Section 65090(a) of the Subdivision Map Act containing a description sufficient to notify the public of the nature of the proposed change in the applicable general or specific plans, or zoning or subdivision ordinances. 
When the city has complied with both subsections (B)(1) and (2) of this section, the city may apply any ordinances, policies or standards enacted or instituted as a result of those proceedings which are in effect on the date that the city approves or disapproves the vesting tentative map. 
C.  If the subdivision applicant requests changes in applicable ordinances, policies or standards in connection with the same development project, any ordinances, policies or standards adopted pursuant to the applicant's request shall apply.

B.  No person shall sell, lease or finance any parcel or parcels of real property or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a parcel map is required by this chapter or the State Subdivision Map Act, until such map thereof, in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the State Subdivision Map Act, has been filed for record by the recorder. 
C.  Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required by this title shall not be made by parcel or block number, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been filed for record with the county recorder. 
D.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements thereon where the sale, lease or financing or the commencement of construction, is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final subdivision map or parcel map as required by law, nor shall this section modify or affect the provisions of Section 11018.2 of the California Business and Professions Code. 
E.  For purposes of this section, the limitation period for commencing an action, either civil or criminal, against the subdivider or an owner of record at the time of a violation of this title or of the Subdivision Map Act, shall be tolled for any time period during which there is no constructive notice of the transaction constituting the violation, because the owner of record, at the time of the violation or at any time thereafter, failed to record a deed, lease or financing document with the county recorder. Penalties for violation of the Subdivision Map Act are described in Section 66499.31 of the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. 1143 N.S. § 57, 1993; Ord. 635 N.S. § A (part), 1983)  
17.52.020 - RemediesConditionsLiability. 
A.  Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the State Subdivision Map Act, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his heirs, personal representative or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year after the date of discovery of the violation, but the deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchases, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his assignee, heir or devisee. 
B.  Any grantee, or his successor in interest, of real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the State Subdivision Map Act may, within one year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property in violation and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to Section 66499.35 of the Government Code of the state, or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of recording. 
C.  The provisions of this chapter shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or his successor in interest under any other provision of law. 
D.  This chapter does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit in the superior court to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease or financing in violation of this title. 
E.  The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the State Subdivision Map Act if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of the real property at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is the current owner of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his interest in such real property. 
F.  The city, in issuing a permit or granting approval for the development of any such real property, may impose those additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property, and which had been established at such time by this title or location ordinance enacted pursuant thereto, except that if a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the provisions of this chapter, only such conditions stipulated shall be applicable. 
(Ord. 635 N.S. § A (part), 1983)  
17.52.030 - Certificate of complianceIssuance. 
A.  Any person owning real property within the city, or a vestee of that person pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property, may request the city engineer to determine whether such real property complies with the provisions of this title and the Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  Upon making such determination, the city engineer shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the recorder of Santa Clara County. Each certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereon complies with applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. 
C.  1.  If the city engineer determines that such real property does not comply with the provisions of this code or the Subdivision Map Act, he shall issue a certificate of compliance or a conditional certificate of compliance. The city engineer may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by ordinance. Except that where the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation of the provisions of this title or the Subdivision Map Act, who by a grant of the real property created a parcel or parcels in violation thereof, and the person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant in violation of this title or the Subdivision Map Act, the city engineer may impose any conditions which may have been applicable to a current division of the property. Upon making the determination and establishing the conditions, the city engineer, or authorized representative, shall cause a conditional certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. Such certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner or vestee who has applied for the certificate pursuant to this section, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property. The fulfillment and implementation of such conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. 
2.  Compliance with such conditions shall not be required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development of such property is issued. 
D.  A recorded final map, parcel map or official map, shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
E.  For the purposes of administration of this title, any parcel that is shown on the county assessor's map prior to 1960 shall be considered as a conforming parcel. 
(Ord. 1143 N.S. § 58, 1993: Ord. 635 N.S. § A (part), 1983)  
17.52.040 - Certificate of noncomplianceIssuance. 
Whenever the city engineer or an authorized representative has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this title or the State Subdivision Map Act, they shall cause to be filed for record with the recorder of the county a tentative notice of violation (certificate of noncompliance) describing the real property in detail, naming the owners thereof, and describing the violation and stating that an opportunity will be given to the owner to present evidence. At least thirty days prior to the recording of a final notice, the owner of the real property shall be advised in writing of the intention to record a final notice and specifying a time, date and place at which the owner may present evidence as to why such notice should not be recorded. If, after the owner has presented evidence, it is determined that there has been no violation, a release of the tentative notice shall be filed with the county recorder. Such tentative or final notice, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such property.

1.  All applicable development review and approval processes have been followed; 
2.  All applicable approvals have been obtained; and 
3.  All required permits or authorizations to proceed have been issued. 
C.  Governmental Activities. The zoning code applies to special districts and state or federal governmental agencies to the extent legally permissible. The zoning code does not apply to public projects of the city of Morgan Hill. Private projects on leased lands owned by the city are not public projects of the city. 
D.  Public Utilities. Public utility facilities are subject to the requirements of the zoning code except to the extent provided by Government Code Section 53091 and the California Public Utilities Code. 
E.  Emergency Powers. The city council may authorize deviations from the zoning code during a local emergency declared and ratified under the Morgan Hill Municipal Code. The city council may authorize a deviation by resolution without notice or public hearing.

18.04.070 - Conflicting provisions. 
A.  Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. Where conflict occurs with state or federal laws, higher law shall control over lower law unless local variation is permitted. 
B.  Conflict with Other City Regulations. Where the zoning code conflicts with other ordinances, resolutions, or regulations of the city of Morgan Hill, the more restrictive shall control. 
C.  Conflict with Private Agreements. It is not the intent of the zoning code to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction, or other agreement between private parties. If the zoning code imposes a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the zoning code shall control. Private agreements may impose greater restrictions than the zoning code, but the city is not responsible for monitoring or enforcing private agreements. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.04.080 - Transitional provisions. 
A.  Relation to Prior Ordinances. This zoning code supersedes the prior zoning code codified in Title 18 of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code.

C.  Nonconforming Parcels, Uses, and Structures. A legal nonconforming parcel, land use, or structure may be maintained and continue as allowed by Chapter 18.68 (Nonconforming Uses and Structures). 
D.  Previously Approved Projects and Projects in Progress. Permits and approvals valid on or before the effective date of this zoning code remain valid until their expiration date. Projects with valid approvals or permits may be carried out in accordance with the development standards in effect at the time of approval, provided that the permit or approval is valid and has not lapsed. A re-application for a permit or approval that expires after the effective date of this zoning code shall fully comply with the standards in effect at the time of re-application. 
E.  Transition to New Zoning Districts. 
1.  Upon the effective date of this zoning code, land that is zoned with a zoning district classification from the previous zoning code shall be re-classified or translated to one of the zoning districts as established in Chapter 18.14 (Zoning Districts and Map) and shown on the zoning map. 
2.  A property shall comply with the regulations of its zoning district classification as shown on the zoning map.

(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
Chapter 18.08 - INTERPRETATION OF THE ZONING CODE 
 
18.08.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes rules and procedures for interpreting the zoning code to ensure that it is applied and enforced in a consistent manner. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.08.020 - Authority. 
The city council delegates to the community development director and the director's designees the authority to interpret the meaning and applicability of all provisions in the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.08.030 - Rules of interpretation. 
A.  Meaning and Intent. All language shall be construed according to the purpose and intent set out in Section 18.04.040 (Purpose of the Zoning Code). 
B.  Minimum Requirements. The zoning code establishes minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When the zoning code provides for discretion on the part of a city official or body, that discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements as necessary to achieve the purpose and intent of the zoning code set out Section 18.04.040 (Purpose of the Zoning Code). 
C.  Headings, Illustrations, and Text. In cases where text conflicts with any heading, table, or figure, the text controls. 
D.  Lists and Examples. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, lists of items or examples that use terms such as "including," "such as," or similar language are intended to provide examples, not to be exhaustive lists of all possibilities. 
E.  Computation of Time. References to days are calendar days unless otherwise stated. When business days are referenced, they shall include only days when City Hall is open. The end of a time period shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last day. If the last day is a holiday observed by the city or a City Hall non-business day, that day shall be excluded. 
F.  References to Other Regulations, Publications, and Documents. Whenever reference is made to a resolution, ordinance, regulation, or document, it shall be construed as a reference to the most recent edition of such resolution, ordinance, regulation, or document, unless specifically stated. 
G.  Technical and Non-Technical Terms. Words and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning. 
H.  Public Officials and Agencies. All public officials, bodies, and agencies to which references are made are those of the city of Morgan Hill, unless otherwise indicated. 
I.  Mandatory and Discretionary Terms. The words "shall," "will," "must," and "is" are always mandatory. The words "may" and "should" are advisory and discretionary terms. 
J.  Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary, conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows: 
1.  "And" means that all connected items, conditions, provisions, or events apply. 
2.  "And/or" means that the connected words or provisions may apply singularly or in any combination. 
3.  "Or" means that one or more of the connected items, conditions, provisions, or events may apply. 
4.  "Eitheror" means that the connected words or provisions shall apply singularly but not in combination. 
K.  Tenses and Plurals. Words used in one tense (past, present, or future) include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular. 
L.  Terms Not Defined. In the event there is a term used in the zoning code that is not defined in this title, the community development director shall have the authority to provide a definition based upon intended meaning of the undefined term. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.08.040 - Land use regulations. 
A.  Land Use Regulation Tables. Land use regulation tables in Part 2 (Zoning Districts and Overlay Zones) establish permitted land uses within each zoning district. Notations within these tables have the following meanings: 
1.  Permitted Uses. A "P" means that a use is permitted by right in the zoning district and is not subject to discretionary review and approval. 
2.  Conditionally Permitted Uses. A "C" means that a use requires approval of a conditional use permit. An "A" means that a use requires approval of an administrative use permit. 
3.  Uses Not Allowed. A "-" means that a use is not allowed in the zoning district. 
B.  Unlisted Land Uses. 
1.  A land use not listed in a land use regulation table is not permitted if the use is listed as a permitted use in one or more other zoning districts. In such a case, the absence of the use in the land use regulation table means that the use is prohibited in the zoning district. 
2.  For a proposed use unlisted in all land use regulation tables, the community development director may determine that the proposed use is equivalent to a permitted or conditionally permitted use if all of the following findings can be made: 
a.  The use is similar to other uses allowed in the zoning district. 
b.  The density or intensity of the use is similar to other uses in the zoning district. 
c.  The use is compatible with permitted or conditionally permitted uses in the zoning district. 
d.  The use will meet the purpose of the zoning district. 
e.  The use is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan. 
f.  The use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare. 
3.  When the community development director determines that a proposed use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use shall be treated in the same manner as the listed use with respect to development standards, permits required, and all applicable requirements of the zoning code. 
C.  Unlawful Uses. Uses that are unlawful under federal or state law are prohibited uses within Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.08.050 - Zoning map. 
A.  Zoning Map Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules apply: 
1.  Boundaries shown as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys are construed to follow the centerlines. 
2.  Boundaries shown as approximately following platted lot lines are construed as following the lot lines. 
3.  Boundaries shown as approximately following city limits are construed as following city limits. 
4.  Boundaries shown following railroad lines are construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
5.  In unsubdivided property or where a zoning district boundary divides a parcel, the location of the boundary is determined by the use of the scale appearing on the zoning map. 
6.  In case further uncertainty exists, the community development director shall determine the exact location of the boundaries. The director's decision may be appealed to the planning commission to determine the exact location of the boundaries. 
B.  Parcels Containing Two or More Zoning Districts. 
1.  For parcels containing two or more zoning districts ("split zoning"), the location of the zoning district boundary shall be determined by the community development director. 
2.  For parcels containing two or more zoning districts, the regulations for each zoning district shall apply within the zoning district boundaries as identified on the zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.08.060 - Procedures for interpretation/determinations. 
A.  Requests for Interpretation. The community development director shall respond in writing to written requests for interpretation of the zoning code if the requested interpretation would substantially clarify an ambiguity which interferes with the effective administration of the zoning code. When the director makes such a determination, the following procedures apply: 
1.  The request shall be in writing, shall identify the provision to be interpreted, and shall be accompanied by the fee identified in the latest planning fee schedule. 
2.  The request shall provide any information that the director requires to assist in its review. 
3.  The director shall respond to an interpretation request within thirty days of receiving a complete request. 
B.  Form and Content of Interpretation. Official interpretations prepared by the director shall be in writing, and shall quote the zoning code provisions being interpreted. The interpretation shall describe the circumstance that caused the need for the interpretation. 
C.  Official Record of Interpretations. An official record of interpretations shall be kept and updated regularly by the development services department. The record of interpretations shall be indexed by the number of the section that is the subject of the interpretation and made available for public inspection during normal business hours. 
D.  Referral to Planning Commission. The director may refer any request for interpretation of the zoning code to the planning commission for review and interpretation. 
E.  Appeals. Any official interpretation prepared by the Director may be appealed to the planning commission. The planning commission's interpretation may be appealed to the city council.

Chapter 18.12 - Rules of Measurement 
 
18.12.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes rules for the measurement of standards contained in the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.020 - Building coverage. 
A.  Building Coverage. Building coverage means the total horizontal area of all buildings on a lot divided by the net lot area. Total horizontal building area is measured from the exterior surface of the exterior ground floor walls of all principal and accessory buildings on the lot. 
B.  Building Coverage (Exclusions). Building coverage does not include the following: 
1.  Unenclosed and unroofed decks, uncovered patio slab, porches, landings, balconies and stairways less than eighteen inches in height at surface of deck (and less than six feet including railings). See Figure 18.12-1. 
2.  Eaves and roof overhangs projecting less than two feet from a wall. 
3.  Areas covered by a trellis or similar structure where at least fifty percent of the area is open to the sky with uniformly distributed openings.

Figure 18.12-1: Deck Excluded from Building Coverage
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.030 - Density. 
Density means the number of dwelling units divided by the net lot area. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.040 - Distances. 
A.  Measurements Are Shortest Distance. When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two objects. 
B.  Distances Are Measured Horizontally. When measuring distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area, or other object. Distances are not measured following the topography or slope of the land. 
C.  Measurements Involving a Structure. Measurements involving a structure are made to the closest support element of the structure. Structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances. 
D.  Measuring Radius. When a specified land use is required to be located a minimum distance from another land use, the minimum distance is measured in a straight line from all points along the lot line of the subject project, in all directions. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.050 - Floor area and floor area ratio. 
A.  Floor Area. 
1.  Floor area means the total enclosed area of all floors of a building measured from the outside face of the structural members in outside walls. 
2.  The floor area calculation includes the following: 
a.  Covered parking areas for residential uses, including detached garages. 
b.  Staircases and elevator shafts at each floor level. 
Service and mechanical equipment rooms. 
c.  Areas with a solid roof even if open on the sides (e.g., covered porches, patios, and California rooms). 
d.  For nonresidential uses, interior walkways or corridors, interior courtyards, walkways, paseos, or corridors covered by a roof or skylight. 
3.  The floor area calculation does not include the following: 
a.  Attic areas as defined in Section 18.128.020.A ("A" Terms). 
b.  Covered parking areas for non-residential uses. 
c.  Basement area as defined in Section 18.128.020.B ("B" Terms). 
d.  Front-facing covered porches where at least fifty percent of the sides are open and exposed (without walls) to adjacent outdoor space. 
e.  Areas covered by a trellis or similar structure where at least fifty percent of the area is open to the sky with uniformly distributed openings. 
f.  Windows or other architectural projections where the vertical distance between the lowest surface of the projection and the finished floor is thirty inches or more. 
g.  For nonresidential uses, arcades, porticoes, and similar open areas that are located at or near street level and are accessible to the general public but are not designed or used as sales, display, storage, service, or production areas. 
B.  Floor Area Ratio. Floor area ratio means the ratio of the total floor area of all buildings on a lot to the net lot area. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.060 - Height. 
A.  Building Height. Building height means the vertical distance from the average contact ground level at the front wall of the building to the highest point of the building. See Figure 18.12-2. 
  
Figure 18.12-2: Building Height
B.  Number of Stories. 
1.  Basements and Cellars. A basement or cellar shall not be included in the calculation of number of stories of a building if the finished surface of the floor above is six feet or less below the average level of the adjoining grade. See Figure 18.12-3. 
  
Figure 18.12-3 Number of Stories - Basement or Cellar Height
2.  Mezzanines. A mezzanine shall not be included in the calculation of number of stories if: 
a.  The mezzanine floor area is one-third or less of the total area of the full floor directly below it; and 
b.  The mezzanine is open on at least two sides to the full floor below. 
C.  Fence or Wall Height. 
1.  Fence or wall height means the vertical distance from the bottom to the top of the fence or wall. 
2.  Fences placed on top of a retaining wall do not include the height of retaining wall. 
3.  If the adjacent finished grade is different on opposite sides of a fence or wall, the height is measured from the side with the lowest finished grade to the highest point on the fence or wall. 
D.  Freestanding Structure Height. For freestanding structures such as poles and towers, structure height means the vertical distance from the finished grade at the base of the structure to the highest point of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.070 - Lot area and dimensions. 
A.  Lot Area. Lot area means the net site area of a lot, expressed in terms of acres or square feet. Lot area does not include: 
1.  Land within the limits of a street (public or private) upon which the lot abuts, even if fee title to such street is held by the owner. 
2.  All public easements (e.g., public streets, utility lines). 
3.  All private easements (e.g., private streets, accessways) other than streets which are in excess of fifteen percent of the net site area of the lot. 
B.  Lot Depth. 
1.  For lots other than flag lots, lot depth means the horizontal distance from the midpoint of the front lot line to the midpoint of the rear lot line, or to the most distant point on any other lot line where there is no rear lot line. See Figure 18.12-4. 
2.  For flag lots, lot depth is measured as the distance of the shortest side property line. 
  
Figure 18.12-4: Lot Depth and Width
C.  Lot Width. 
1.  For lots other than cul-de-sac lots, lot width means the distance measured along a straight line between the midpoints of the side property lines. 
2.  For flag lots, the measurement of the midpoint of the side property lines excludes the narrow corridor providing access to the street. 
3.  For cul-de-sac lots, lot width is measured at the rear property line. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.12.080 - Setbacks. 
A.  Measure at Right Angles. The distance/depth of a setback area (i.e., front, side, or rear) shall be measured at right angles from the nearest property line establishing a setback area line parallel to that lot line. See Figure 18.12-4. 
  
Figure 18.12-4: Setbacks
B.  Planned Street Widening. Where a lot abuts a street designated for a future widening, required minimum setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the planned future right-of-way. 
C.  Future Street Right-of-Way. Where a future street right-of-way is planned or established, required minimum setbacks shall be measured from property lines that define the edge of the future right-of-way. 
D.  Alleys. 
1.  If side lot line abuts an alley, the lot line shall be treated as interior side lot line for the purpose of establishing minimum required setbacks. 
2.  The width of an adjoining alley is not included in the measurement of a required setback. 
E.  Rear Lot Lines. 
1.  Irregularly Shaped Lots. Where the side lot lines converge to a point at the rear of the lot and make an angle ninety degrees or less, a line ten feet long within the lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line, shall be deemed to be the rear lot line for the purpose of determining the depth of the required rear setback area. Where the angle created by the convergence of two side lot lines at the rear of the lot is greater than ninety degrees, a line ten feet long measured from the point of convergence and perpendicular to the front lot line shall establish the location of the required rear setback line.

New development respects Morgan Hill's history and reflects its unique small-town feel. The diversity of land uses, pedestrian-friendly development, and general level of activity in the mixed use zoning districts supports a range of transportation choices, including walking, biking, and transit. 
B.  Specific. 
1.  Downtown Mixed Use (MU-D). The purpose of the Downtown Mixed Use (MU-D) zoning district is to preserve and enhance Downtown as the heart of Morgan Hill and the center of the community. New development supports a walkable Downtown district with active storefronts and a diversity of commercial, residential, and public uses. The intensity of residential uses enhances economic vitality, increases housing options for residents of all ages, and support a vibrant and diverse destination for residents and visitors. The MU-D zoning district implements the community's vision for Downtown Morgan Hill as described in the Downtown Specific Plan. 
2.  Neighborhood Mixed Use (MU-N). The purpose of the Neighborhood Mixed Use (MU-N) zoning district accommodates a range of residential and commercial land uses in close proximity to Downtown. A range of housing types provide residents with affordable housing options and increase opportunities to live close to stores, services, jobs, and transit. The MU-N zoning district provides a transition from the higher intensity uses in the Downtown Core to lower density residential neighborhoods. 
3.  Mixed Use Flex (MU-F). The purpose of the MU-F zoning district is to accommodate a mixture of residential and commercial uses typically along the Monterey Road corridor north and south of Downtown. New mixed use development may be vertical (residences above ground floor commercial) or horizontal (separate buildings with different uses on a single site). Development in the MU-F zoning district creates attractive gateways into Morgan Hill, provides a range of housing options, and creates new centers of activity to serve surrounding neighborhoods.

Chapter 18.24 - Commercial Zoning Districts 
 
18.24.010 - Purpose of the commercial zoning districts. 
A.  General. The purpose of the commercial zoning districts is to provide locations for a variety of commercial uses to meet the need of residents, visitors, and workers in Morgan Hill. Development within the commercial zoning districts is attractively designed to enhance Morgan Hill's unique character and economic prosperity. Commercial uses are clustered and concentrated to utilize land resources efficiently and support a balanced transportation system. Employment uses accommodate a diversity of jobs that contribute to a dynamic local economy. 
B.  Specific. 
1.  Administrative Office (CO). The purpose of the CO zoning district is to provide an area where professional, general commercial offices and limited personal services may develop in close relationship with each other outside of other commercial districts. 
2.  Neighborhood Commercial (CN). The purpose of the CN zoning district is to provide a location for retail, office, and service uses to serve residents living in surrounding neighborhoods. 
3.  General Commercial (CG). The purpose of the CG zoning district is to provide a location for a broad range of commercial and employment uses to serve Morgan Hill residents, workers, and visitors. 
4.  Highway Commercial (CH). The purpose of the CH zoning district is to provide areas adjacent to the freeway that can accommodate highway and tourist-oriented uses and uses which require the high visibility of thoroughfare locations. 
5.  Service Commercial (CS). The purpose of the CS zoning district is to provide an area for commercial services that may be inappropriate in neighborhood or pedestrian-oriented shopping areas, and which generally require automotive access for customer convenience, servicing of vehicles or equipment, loading or unloading, or parking of commercial service vehicles.

Chapter 18.26 - INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
18.26.010 - Purpose of the industrial zoning districts. 
A.  General. The purpose of the industrial zoning districts is to provide locations to maintain and focus industrial development in economically and geographically strategic locations in Morgan Hill. Permitted land uses in the industrial zoning districts are limited to avoid potential conflicts that would adversely impact industrial activities. Development is designed to enhance the economic vitality of industrial areas and limit impacts on adjacent development. 
B.  Specific. 
1.  Commercial Industrial (CI). The purpose of the CI zoning district is to promote job-generating development of lands by allowing flexibility in the mix of industrial, office, and commercial uses that are compatible with existing development. Lodging uses (e.g., hotels) that support primary job generating uses within business districts are allowed. 
2.  Light Office Industrial (IO). The purpose of the IO zoning district is to provide areas for mixed administrative and executive office uses in appropriate areas within the community. 
3.  Campus Industrial (IC). The purpose of the IC zoning district is to provide an environment exclusively for and conducive to the development and protection of modern administrative facilities, research institutions and specialized manufacturing operations. 
4.  Light Industrial (IL). The purpose of the IL zoning district is to provide areas for research, administrative, lighter manufacturing, wholesale and heavy service commercial uses not suitable in commercial districts. 
5.  General Industrial (IG). The purpose of the IG zoning district is to provide areas for general industrial, manufacturing, wholesale and service uses needed by the city and region subject to regulations necessary to protect other nearby uses from hazards and noise and other disturbances.

18.28.010 - Purpose of the open space, public, and recreation zoning districts. 
A.  Open Space. The purpose of the Open Space (OS) zoning district is to preserve and enhance open space lands as a limited and valuable resource in Morgan Hill. The OS zoning district is intended to permit limited but reasonable use of open space lands while reducing exposure to geologic hazards, to preserve agricultural land, and to preserve the topographic features that contribute to Morgan Hill's unique identity. 
B.  Public Facilities. The purpose of the Public Facilities (PF) zoning district is to provide a location for schools, governmental offices, parks and recreational facilities, fire and police stations, utilities, and other public and quasi-public facilities to serve the community. 
C.  Sports Recreation and Leisure (SRL). The purpose of the SRL zoning district is to provide a location for a variety of private and public or quasi-public land sports, recreation, and leisure uses to serve the community. The SRL zoning district includes two sub-zones: 
1.  The SRL-A sub-zone which supports lower intensity sports, recreation, and leisure uses that are compatible with nearby agricultural and open space activities; and 
2.  The SRL-B sub-zone which supports lower and medium intensity sports, recreation, and leisure uses that are generally open in nature.

Chapter 18.30 - OVERLAY ZONES AND COMBINING DISTRICTS 
 
18.30.010 - Purpose of overlay zones and combining districts. 
A.  Overlay Zones. An overlay zone is a defined geographic area shown on the zoning map where special requirements apply in addition to the underlying base zoning district requirements. 
B.  Combining Districts. A combining district is a designation applied to a property, or a portion of a property, indicating that special requirements apply in addition to the base zoning district requirements. If and when a combining district is applied to a property, it is shown on the zoning map with the combining district label attached to base zoning district label (e.g., "RE (H)"). 
C.  Conflicting Requirements. Whenever a requirement of an overlay zone or combining district conflicts with a requirement of the underlying base zone, the overlay zone or combining district requirement shall control. Where two or more overlay zone or combining district requirements conflict, the review authority for the requested permit or approval shall determine the appropriate requirement. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.30.020 - Downtown ground floor overlay zone. 
A.  Purpose of Downtown Ground Floor Overlay Zone. The purpose of the Downtown Ground Floor (-GF) overlay zone is to ensure that ground floor land uses fronting Monterey Road and Third Street in Downtown Morgan Hill support an active and engaging pedestrian environment in a manner consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan.

4.  Findings. To approve an administrative use permit, the community development director shall make all of the findings in Section 18.108.020.E (Findings for Approval) plus one or more of the following additional findings: 
a.  The subject space in the building has been advertised for lease to retail tenants for at least six months days, but the owner has been unable to locate a suitable retail tenant at market rates; or 
b.  The vacancy rate for commercial space exceeds five percent in the -GF overlay zone combining district; or 
c.  For personal service uses, the applicant has demonstrated that the use is ancillary to a retail use within the tenant space and provides a continuity of display window visual interest. 
5.  Conditions of Approval. The community development director may impose conditions on the approval of an administrative use permit to achieve consistency with the general plan, zoning code, or Downtown Specific Plan. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements that the city and/or applicant: 
a.  Review the use at a future time or upon certain triggering events; 
b.  Set an expiration date for the administrative use permit at some future time or upon certain triggering events; 
c.  Make specific site maintenance and/or improvements; 
d.  Maintain the personal service use as ancillary to the retail use with the same tenant space and maintain the visual interest of display window with the retail component;

b.  For lots with an average slope greater than fifty percent, the minimum lot size is five acres. 
c.  Lots with an average slope of ten percent or greater may be created in exception to the slope/area formula above if the lots to be created contain an area of slope less than ten percent which is equal to or greater than the minimum lot size required by the underlying zone. In such a case, a deed restriction must be recorded for such lots which restrict building to the area in which the average slope is ten percent or less. 
3.  Calculating Ground Slope. 
a.  The average ground slope shall be calculated using the following formula: 
S = 0.00229IL/A 
Where: 
S = Average ground slope in percent 
I = Contour interval in feet 
L = Combined length of the contour lines in feet 
A = The gross area in acres of the parcel or lot 
b.  Measurements along contours shall be made at contour intervals not to exceed ten feet, and a horizontal map scale of one inch equals two hundred feet or larger. 
4.  Land Modification Restrictions. 
a.  Areas on a lot with a slope exceeding twenty percent may not be altered by grading, altering natural features, removing natural vegetation, or by any activity related to the preparation of the lot for development.

This section allows for the transfer development credits (TDCs) from "transferor sites" in areas where development is restricted by the H combining district to "recipient sites" in other areas of the city authorized to receive TDCs. The city council may from time to time authorize by resolution a TDC from one lot to another lot, where such authorization is found to be consistent with the general plan and this section. 
1.  General Standards. 
a.  Permitted Recipient Sites. Zones in which an increase in the number of dwelling units are permitted are restricted to the residential zones listed in Chapter 18.16 (Residential Detached Zoning Districts). 
b.  Number of Units on a Site. The number of dwelling units permitted on a site may not exceed ten percent of the maximum residential development credits transfer, exclusive of density bonuses provided by other sections of this title. 
c.  Maximum Density Bonus. The maximum density bonus on any site shall not exceed twenty-five percent, including affordable housing and TDC density bonuses. 
d.  Environmental Study. An environmental study shall be prepared to determine the carrying capacity of the property from which development credits are being transferred. If environmental findings determine that the site, or a portion thereof, is unbuildable due to environmental constraints, the development credits to be transferred shall be reduced accordingly, prior to determining the number of units permissible under the slope-density formula. 
e.  Minimum Area. The site to which the TDC is proposed shall be no less than one acre. 
f.  Setback Requirements. All setback requirements of the more restrictive district found along the perimeter of the site shall apply to perimeter yards on the site to which the transfer of development credits is proposed, unless the site is zoned for PD zoning. 
g.  Calculation of TDC Credits. TDCs shall be calculated in accordance with the slope-density regulations of this section, base district minimum lot sizes and this section. 
(1)  In all hillside areas of the City, with the exception of El Toro Mountain, the number of TDCs shall be determined as provided in Section 18.30.040.D (El Toro Mountain Open Space Preservation). 
(2)  On El Toro Mountain, the number of TDCs available to property within the city limits shall be twice that determined as provided in Section 18.30.040.C.2 (Minimum Lot Area). The number of transferable development credits available to property on El Toro Mountain which is outside the city limits shall be twice that allowed by the Zoning Ordinance of Santa Clara County. The calculation of transferable development credits for El Toro Mountain shall be as follows: 
(Number of Acres/Minimum Lot Size) x 2 = Number of transferable development credits 
(3)  The number of TDCs available to properties on El Toro Mountain above that allowed to other hillside areas of the city may only be used for transfer to other properties of slopes less than twenty percent and may not be used to increase on-site development potential. 
(4)  In the calculation of TDCs, a fraction occurring at the end of a calculation which is 0.5 or larger shall be considered a full development credit. The city council may also exclude from calculation any existing dwelling and appurtenant structures on the site to be preserved. 
2.  Application. An applicant for a TDC shall contain the following information and materials: 
a.  A title report and any other documentation disclosing all existing interests or obligations against the transferor site property to be affected by the open space easement. If other interests exist, a subordination agreement (in a recordable form) acknowledging the reservation of the city of Morgan Hill's open space easement claim shall be submitted with the title report. 
b.  When known, the location and land area of the recipient site to which such credits are to be transferred, the projected total number of dwelling units that would result on the recipient site from such a transfer, and a statement of the character of the projected housing development. 
c.  A legal description of the open space to be preserved on the transferor site by the transfer, accompanied by an open space (scenic) easement suitable for recordation and the applicable open-space policy to be implemented by the transfer. 
d.  The location, site area, and related residential development credits of the transferor site which the applicant proposes to transfer. 
e.  Where applicable, the number of building allotments granted to the recipient site under the residential development control system (RDCS). 
3.  City Action. Upon approval of the planning commission and the city council of a TDC application, the City Clerk shall issue a TDC certificate to the applicant in a form approved by the city manager. The following actions must be taken prior to these development credits being effectively conveyed to and utilized by the recipient property: 
a.  Approval by the planning commission of a detailed site plan of the recipient site to which the development credits are to be transferred; 
b.  Where recipient site is known, execution and recordation with the county recorder's office of an instrument legally sufficient both in form and content to effect conveyance of the TDC from the transferor to the recipient site. Such instrument shall specifically set forth the credits to be conveyed and the resultant total residential development credits assignable to the recipient site; 
c.  Execution and recordation with the county recorder's office of an instrument legally sufficient in form and content to effect conveyance of a permanent open space easement in the transferor site dedicated to the city. Such open space easement shall be unencumbered by any prior interests or, if so encumbered, shall be accompanied by and recorded together with subordination agreement with evidence that all persons or entities having any interest in the transferor site have acknowledged the creation and transfer of development credits, consented to the terms and conditions of the open space easement, and waived the priority of any rights or claims they may have in the transferor site. Recordation of the executed open space easement and accompanying subordination agreement shall serve as notice of the dedication of open space in the transferor site and shall be incorporated in the deeds of the transferor site; and 
d.  Other requirements as established by the city council.

18.30.060 - Active fault surface rupture combining district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the Active Fault Surface Rupture (AFSR) combining district is protect the public from hazards caused by development located across active faults and to implement requirements of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act and any successor statute or regulations (Public Resource Code Section 2621 et seq.). 
B.  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, certain terms are defined as follows: 
1.  "Active fault" is any fault which has had surface displacement within Holocene time (about the last eleven thousand years), hence constituting a potential hazard to structures that might be located across it. 
2.  "Fault trace" is the intersection of a fault surface with the earth's surface and is usually represented as a line on a map. 
3.  "Official earthquake fault zone" are those areas delineated on the most current versions of maps issued by the California State Geologist, along faults deemed "sufficiently active and well-defined" pursuant to the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone Act (Public Resources Code Section 2621 et seq.), and the policies and criteria of the state mining and geology board and any succeeding statute or regulation. 
4.  "Project," as used in this section, means: 
a.  Any subdivision of land which is subject to the Subdivision Map Act, Division 2 (commencing with Section 66410) of Title 7 of the Government Code, and which contemplates the eventual construction of structures for human occupancy; and 
b.  Structures for human occupancy. 
c.  "Project" does not include repairs, alterations or additions to any structure within a fault zone which do not exceed fifty percent of the value of the structure or which is a conversion of an apartment complex into a condominium. 
5.  "Qualified geologist" is a certified engineering geologist pursuant to the California Geologist and Geophysicist Act (Business and Professions Code Section 7800, et seq.). 
6.  "Structures for human occupancy" are any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy, which is expected to have a human occupancy rate of more than two thousand person-hours per year. 
C.  Prohibited Development. 
1.  A structure for human occupancy identified as a project within the AFSR Combining District shall not be: 
a.  Located across the trace of an active fault; or 
b.  Located within fifty feet of an active fault unless proven not to be underlain by active branches of the fault by a geologic report prepared by a qualified geologist. 
2.  The change in use or character of occupancy of a building or structure from one not used for human occupancy to one that is used for human occupancy is prohibited unless the building or structure complies with this chapter. 
D.  Geologic Report. 
1.  Need for Report. For proposed projects located in the AFSR combining district, the applicant shall submit to the city a geologic report prepared by a qualified geologist. The applicant's geologist shall discuss the scope of work with a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city (reviewing geologist) prior to performing the investigation. The city shall file with the state geologist one copy of all completed geologic reports within thirty days following the community development director's acceptance of the report as complete. 
2.  Waiver. The community development director may waive the requirement to prepare a geologic report in the following circumstances: 
a.  If the director determines that no undue fault hazard exists based on the advice and recommendation of a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city, the director may set forth such determination in writing, citing the reasons for a waiver. Any waiver under this subsection shall be allowed only with approval of the state geologist. 
b.  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, for a project consisting of single-family wood-frame or steel-frame dwelling not exceeding two stories when that dwelling is not part of a development of four or more dwellings, the director may waive the requirement for a geologic report upon determining that no undue fault hazard exists based on the advice and recommendation of the qualified geologist employed or retained by the city. 
3.  Preparation. The geologic report required by this section shall be prepared and based on an investigation directed to the problem of potential surface displacement through the project site, and shall identify the location, recency, and nature of faulting that may have affected the project site in the past and may affect the project in the future. 
E.  Appeals. Decisions of the community development director and planning commission made pursuant to this section may be appealed in accordance with Chapter 18.112 (Appeals) 
F.  Additional Regulations. 
1.  In addition to the regulations set forth in this section, the development services department, with the consent of the city council, may adopt such standards or regulations as necessary to protect the public from the effects of surface rupture along active faults in official earthquake fault zones. 
2.  These standards or regulations may be more stringent than, but shall not be in conflict with, the provisions of any policies and criteria adopted by the state mining and geology board pursuant to Section 2623 et seq. of the Public Resources Code of the state. 
3.  Where more stringent standards or regulations have been adopted, the policies and criteria adopted from time to time by the state mining and geology board shall apply within the city. 
G.  Consistency with Other Regulations. 
1.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person of requirements imposed by other sections of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), or any other applicable provision of state law.

Part 3 - CITYWIDE STANDARDS  
Chapter 18.40 - ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS FOR MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
18.40.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide alternative development standards for medium density residential development including single-family detached and attached housing units on small lots (less than seven thousand square feet). The intent of these standards is to: 
A.  Ensure that small lot development blends with the surrounding community and is compatible with neighborhoods, is sensitive to its context, and incorporates appropriate amenities and high-quality design; 
B.  Implement residential development standards to enhance the appearance of the surrounding neighborhood and be well integrated with existing homes nearby; 
C.  Discourage abrupt transitions in height, mass, and prevailing setback patterns and separations caused by high, solid walls and blank building faces; 
D.  Recognize small lot and medium density development as a more efficient form of land use than lower density development, a means of reducing the environmental impacts of housing development, and a way to create more walkable neighborhoods; 
E.  Guide new development while accommodating creativity, innovation, and flexibility in housing design; and 
F.  Implement Morgan Hill Housing Element policies which encourage greater housing diversity and affordability in Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.40.020 - Applicability. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter are intended for use in the residential attached low density (RAL) and residential attached medium density (RAM) zoning districts and are principally intended for single-family homes, townhomes, patio homes, courtyard homes, duets, and similar single-family detached and attached housing types. The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable in the residential detached (RDL, RDM, RDH), residential attached high density (RAH) and mixed use (MU-D, MU-N, MU-F) zoning districts. 
B.  The standards in this chapter may be used as an alternative to the development standards for the RAL and RAM zoning districts contained in Chapter 18.18 (Residential Attached Zoning Districts). The standards in this chapter are not mandatory but instead provide an alternative to accommodate a wider range of housing types in a manner that enhances Morgan Hill's unique feel and minimizes impacts on adjacent properties. 
C.  Modifications to homes in small lot developments already existing as of October 7, 2015 shall be exempt from these standards.

[2] Roof terraces and roof gardens may provide up to fifty percent of the required common open space area if the planning commission finds that roof terraces and roof gardens provide quality open space for residents and minimize noise, privacy and other potential impacts on neighboring properties. 
D.  Open Space  Attached and Detached Single-Family Homes. The following open space provisions apply specifically to small lot, courtyard, and townhome housing types, and other new developments with similar housing types. The standards recognize that small lot subdivisions may have greater common open space needs than conventional single-family development due to their smaller yard areas. 
1.  Private Open Space. Each lot must include a private open space area, such as a private yard, porch, balcony, roof garden, or patio. Private open space must be contiguous to the unit it serves and accessible and visible from the living area of the unit. The minimum amount of private open space per unit shown in Table 18.40-4 may be reduced by up to twenty-five percent if off-set by the equivalent increase in common open space. 
2.  Common Open Space. Developments which have either: (a) average lot size of smaller than four thousand three hundred fifty-six square feet (e.g., density of more than ten units per net acre) or (b) fifteen units or more, are required to provide common open space for the development's residents. Table 18.40-4 identifies the open space requirements, which vary based on lot size. Such common open space shall be visible from internal or external streets and shall be designed for informal surveillance from private residences to enhance neighborhood security. Common open space shall have a minimum usable width of fifteen feet and a minimum area of five hundred square feet, a slope of no more than ten percent, accessibility to all units, and be open to the sky. It may contain amenities which enhance usability, such as swimming pools, play equipment, benches and tables, and barbecues. Parking, loading, and service areas may not be counted as open space.

Notes: 
[1] Private open space per unit may be reduced by up to twenty-five percent if off-set by the equivalent increase in common open space. 
E.  Landscaping, Lighting, and Other Site Improvements. Landscaping, lighting and other site improvements shall be designed to diminish the impact of the denser development and provide a softer appearance as follows: 
1.  No more than fifty percent of any required front or street-facing side yard shall be covered with a paved or impervious surface. 
2.  A planter strip at least five feet wide shall be provided on the street-facing side of all walls fronting public or private roads in addition to landscaping provided as part of the streetscape. 
3.  A sufficient number and type of trees shall be provided to shade the sidewalks. Planting shall be done at the time public improvements are constructed. 
4.  Street lights shall be designed and scaled at a pedestrian scale with a maximum height of sixteen feet. "Cobra head" type street lights are prohibited. 
F.  Orientation. All units located along public streets shall have the primary entrance facing the street right-of-way. Exceptions to this requirement may be approved by the city for projects which are located on four-lane streets carrying high traffic volumes and streets that do not allow on-street parking. In such cases, the project may be oriented around private streets or courtyards. 
G.  Roof-Mounted Equipment. Any roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be incorporated into the roof design in such a way that it becomes an integral part of the architecture or is concealed from view. 
H.  Screening. Mechanical equipment and trash enclosures shall be screened as follows: 
1.  Air conditioners, heaters, utility equipment, meters, and similar equipment shall be screened from public view. Above-ground utility transformers and other above grade equipment shall not be located within the front yard along a street. 
2.  Fencing, landscaping, or view-obscuring structures shall be provided to screen trash cans or other refuse containers from view from public rights-of-way while still providing easy access to trash receptacles (see Figure 18.40-1). 
3.  A gate wide enough to allow for passage of city standard trash and recycling receptacles shall be provided. 
4.  Trash/recycling container storage areas shall have a smooth solid surface such as concrete or pavers. 
5.  The location of trash and recycling container storage areas shall be shown on plans submitted for planning and building permits.

18.40.070 - Design criteria for small lot single-family subdivisions. 
A.  Applicability. The standards in this section apply to small lot single-family subdivisions. They are not applicable to townhome developments or other development where the predominant unit type is attached housing. 
B.  Unit Types. Units in small lot subdivisions may include single-family detached homes and "duets" which share a common wall on one side. 
C.  Lot Patterns. Lot patterns shall be varied to avoid monotonous streetscapes and shall include: 
1.  A variety of lot widths, depths, shapes, and sizes, such that there is a perceptible difference between lot sizes on a block. Lots shall be designed to accommodate a variety of home styles, setbacks, and garage placements; 
2.  Larger lots on corners; 
3.  Smaller lots surrounding common open space areas; and 
4.  Blocks no longer than six hundred linear feet. 
D.  Floor Plans and Front Elevations. The excessive repetition of identical floor plans and elevations shall be avoided. In subdivisions with fewer than twenty lots, at least three unique front elevations and floor plans shall be provided. In subdivisions with twenty lots or greater, at least four unique front elevations and floor plans shall be provided. Location of identical models on adjacent lots, including "back to back" lots, shall be avoided. 
E.  Four-Sided Design. Facades facing the side and rear yard shall include details which are compatible with those on the front facade, with similar types and treatments of roofs, windows, shutters, planter boxes, and other architectural elements. 
F.  Front Setbacks. Front yard setbacks shall be varied (see Figure 18.40-2). Generally, at least fifty percent of the homes shall have front yard setbacks which are greater than the minimum required (excluding porches and non-habitable space). This component may be implemented by recording "build to" lines on the final subdivision map. 
Figure 18.40-2: Small Lot Single-Family Subdivision Front Yard Setbacks
  
G.  Rear Setbacks. A variety of rear setbacks shall be provided in order to avoid the appearance of long, monotonous walls from adjacent properties along the rear lot lines. 
H.  Building Size and Design. A variety of unit types and sizes, sited to provide compatibility with nearby neighborhoods, shall be provided. Buildings shall incorporate the following design features: 
1.  Roof Variation. Rooflines along the longer axis of the building shall be broken with varied pitches at the skyline level. Features such as turrets, dormers, and other variations that add architectural interest and distinction are encouraged. 
2.  Building Height Variation. Homes shall feature a variety of building heights, potentially including single story, two-story, three-story, split level units, and units with partial second floors. Units abutting lower density development on the perimeter of a subdivision shall generally be lower in height, or split level in design to enhance compatibility. 
3.  Recessed Upper Stories. For at least fifty percent of the units, the second and third stories shall be recessed relative to the first story to reduce the appearance of building mass. The design shall avoid tall sheer walls, and preserve the privacy of adjacent properties. 
4.  Primary Entrances. Primary entrances to homes shall be in a prominent and visible location facing the street. Primary entrances shall not face the side yard setback or a deep recess of the building. 
5.  Usable Porches, Wherever Feasible. Porches shall have a minimum depth of five feet and a minimum width of eight feet, preferably extending a minimum of fifty percent of the width of the front facade, excluding the garage. Porches shall also incorporate different architectural features such as railings, short walls, trellises, and varied roof elements to provide architectural detail, character, and visual interest. 
6.  Garage Entries. There shall be a minimum of two locations of garage entries, such as front-facing attached garages, detached garages, and garages which are side-facing or accessed via a rear alley. 
7.  Recessed Garages. Garage faces shall be recessed a minimum of five feet from the primary facade of the residence (where they face the street and not a rear alley), in order to minimize the impact of the garage on the streetscape. The garage shall not comprise more than fifty percent of the front building facade (see Figure 18.40-3) on a residential unit. If additional articulation and architectural features are introduced to minimize the impact of the garage on the streetscape, the garage front facade length may be increased to sixty-seven percent. Driveways shall facilitate tandem parking where feasible. 
Figure 18.40-3: Standards for Street-Facing Attached Garages in Small Lot Subdivisions
  
I.  Driveways. Driveways shall be designed to reduce the amount of pavement within the subdivision to the greatest extent possible, as follows: 
1.  Maximum driveway width shall be twenty feet unless a wider driveway, up to twenty-four feet, is required for safe access; 
2.  Shared driveways, such that there is a single curb cut providing access to two houses, shall be encouraged in order to reduce the number of curb cuts along a street; 
3.  Driveways (and related curb cuts) shall be sited to maximize opportunities for on-street parking; and 
4.  Side driveways to rear garages shall be designed wherever feasible to create opportunities for off-street tandem parking in the side yard. 
J.  Parking. Parking requirements shall conform to the standards set in Chapter 18.72 (Parking and Loading), except as otherwise indicated below: 
1.  Two covered parking spaces shall be required for each housing unit; and 
2.  Two additional parking spaces for each unit shall be available for the use of residents and guests. These spaces may include a combination of driveway parking (including tandem parking), alley parking, on-street parking in front of the residence, and designated guest parking areas. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.40.080 - Special criteria for townhome developments. 
A.  Applicability. This section applies specifically to townhome developments. For the purposes of this section, a townhome shall be defined as a series of three or more adjacent single-family dwelling units, each on an independent parcel, which are connected by common walls along the side property lines. Townhomes include row houses but do not include duplexes or duets. Interior unit townhomes typically have zero feet side yard setbacks on both sides, while end unit townhomes have a zero feet side yard setback on one side. 
B.  Facade Articulation. All building facades shall have at least one horizontal or vertical projection or recess at least four feet in depth, or two projections at least two and one-half feet in depth, for every twenty-five horizontal feet of wall. The articulated elements must be greater than one story in height and may be grouped rather than evenly spaced in twenty-five-foot modules. Front porches, stoops, fireplaces, overhangs, trellises, and similar projections into the front yard may count toward this requirement. 
C.  Variable Roof Forms. Variable roof forms shall be incorporated into the building design. No more than two side-by-side units may be covered by one unarticulated roof. Articulations may be accomplished by changing roof height, offsets, and direction of slope and by introducing elements such as dormers, towers, and parapets. Alternative design approaches may be approved by the city, provided the goal of breaking down large building masses into smaller units is achieved. 
D.  Garage Location. Garages shall be located to the rear of the townhome and accessed via an alley or shared driveway wherever feasible. Garage faces shall be recessed a minimum of five feet from the primary facade of the residence (where the garage faces the street and not a rear alley) in order to minimize the impact of the garage on the streetscape. The garage shall not comprise more than fifty percent of the front building facade on a residential unit. 
E.  Facade Detailing and Materials. All visible building facades shall incorporate details, such as window trim, window recesses, cornices, changes in materials, or other design elements, in an integrated composition.

18.40.090 - Special criteria for courtyard home development. 
A.  Applicability. This section shall specifically apply to courtyard home development. For the purposes of this section, courtyard homes are defined as individual homes on small lots arranged around a common driveway. Courtyard homes are intended to lessen the impact of curb cuts and garages on the streetscape and enable homes to be oriented to a public street or open space rather than a driveway and street-facing garage. 
B.  Units Per Courtyard. No more than six units shall be accessed from a single courtyard. 
C.  Orientation. Homes adjacent to the street to which the courtyard connects shall face that street (rather than the courtyard) whenever feasible. 
D.  Courtyard Design and Pavement. The portion of the courtyard used for vehicle circulation shall be finished with decorative pavement and shall be at least sixteen feet wide, with a minimum width of twenty feet at its entrance to the adjacent street. Courtyards shall not exceed one hundred feet in length. 
E.  Vistas. Terminating vistas of the courtyard from nearby streets shall not be dominated by garages. 
F.  Garage Aprons. Paved areas in front of garage doors shall have a minimum backout dimension of twenty-four feet. To avoid obstruction of the courtyard, garage aprons shall be either less than six feet deep or more than eighteen feet deep. Aprons shall be limited to the rear units on a courtyard so that the parking aprons are not visible from the adjacent public or private streets. 
G.  Recessing of Garages. Garages shall be recessed behind the main dwelling unit by at least two feet. 
H.  Architectural Unity. All units on a court shall share a common architectural theme, although variations in building types and elevations on end units are encouraged. 
I.  Windows. Windows shall be sited and designed to maximize privacy and shall be set back from the property line to the maximum extent feasible. Second floor windows overlooking private open space areas of adjacent units shall be avoided wherever feasible. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)

(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.60.010 - Applicability. 
This chapter applies to potentially significant, significant, and designated historical resources within the city of Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.60.020 - Definitions. 
A.  Terms Defined. Terms used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
1.  "Adopted survey list" is a list of resources (e.g., object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript) which the city of Morgan Hill determines to be historically significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of Morgan Hill but have not been officially designated or listed on the local register. Resources listed on the adopted survey list shall be considered significant historical resources for the purposes of this chapter. 
2.  "Age" means the characteristic of being at least forty-five years old. 
3.  "Alteration" is exterior change or modification of character-defining features, through public or private action, of any significant or potentially significant historical resource, or of any contributing resource located within an historic district, which may include but not be limited to, exterior changes to or modification of structure, architectural details or visual characteristics such as surface texture, grading, surface paving, new structures, cutting or removal of trees and other natural features, disturbance of archeological sites or areas and the placement or removal of any exterior objects such as signs, plaques, light fixtures, street furniture, walls, fences, steps, significant plantings and landscape accessories, to the extent that such would affect the exterior character-defining features of the property containing the resource. 
4.  "Association" is the direct link between an important historic event or persons and a historic property for design, engineering or construction value and the ability to yield important information about prehistory or history. 
5.  "Buildings" are structures created to shelter human activity. Historic buildings are considered in their entirety. A building that has lost its basic structural elements is usually considered a "ruin" and is categorized as a site. 
6.  "Character-defining features" are those physical characteristics of an historical resource that convey its historical significance and justify its inclusion in or eligibility for inclusion in the National, California or Local Register. Character-defining features of a resource are documented by a qualified professional on a primary record survey form and/or a full historic evaluation; and also may consist of features mutually agreed upon by a property owner and the community development director or designated city staff. 
7.  "Design" is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure and style of a property. 
8.  "Designated historical resource" is any historical resource that has been determined to be significant and that has been designated and placed on a local register of historical resources pursuant to this chapter. 
9.  "Evaluation" is an intensive survey used to determine historical significance of a resource. An evaluation consists of completed Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) 523 series survey forms, including: 1) Primary Record (523A); 2) Building, Structure, Object Record (523B); and 3) Any additional survey form appropriate for documentation of the subject resource. 
10.  "Feeling" is a property's expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time and results from the presence of physical features that, taken together, convey the property's historic character. 
11.  "Historical resources" include the following classifications: buildings, structures, sites, objects, historic district and archaeological resources that have determined to have a) Age, b) Integrity and c) Historical significance. For the purposes of this chapter and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the term "historical resources" shall include the following: 
a.  A resource listed in, or determined to be eligible by the State Historical Resources Commission, for listing in the National Register or the California Register of Historical Resources. 
b.  A resource included in a local register of historical resources or identified as significant in an historical resource survey meeting the requirements of section 5024.1(g) of the California Public Resources Code will be presumed to be historically or culturally significant, unless the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally significant. 
c.  Any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript which the city of Morgan Hill determines to be historically significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of California or of Morgan Hill. 
d.  The fact that a resource is not listed in or determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register, and is not listed in a local register, does not preclude the city from determining that the resource is a potentially significant historical resource, such that further evaluation can be required to evaluate the resource for historic significance. 
12.  "Historic context statement" is a document adopted by the city council that describes historic periods and themes in Morgan Hill's history, which is used as a tool to assist with the assessment of a property's historic significance, by providing a framework against which to objectively qualify the property's relationship to larger themes and events. 
13.  "Historic district" is a geographically-definable areaurban or rural, small or largepossessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures and/or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history. A contributing resource within the district is an historical resource which contributes to the character of a historic district as described in National Register Bulletin 15. 
14.  "Historical significance" in national, state or local history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that possess age, integrity and association with an important historical context: 
a.  That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our national, state and/or local history and cultural heritage; or 
b.  That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our national, state and/or local past; or 
c.  That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master or important creative individual, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
d.  That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. 
15.  "Historic preservation officer" is defined as the community development director when such a designation is relevant for consultation with federal agencies for the purpose of Section 106 procedures. This designation may be used for other consultations affecting community historical resources. 
16.  "Integrity" is the ability of a property to convey its significance and evaluation of integrity is grounded in an understanding of a property's physical features and how they relate to its significance. There are seven aspects or qualities that, in various combinations, define integrity: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association. To retain historic integrity a property will always possess several, and usually most, of the aspects. Determining which of the seven aspects are most important to a property requires knowing why, where and when the property is significant. 
17.  "Interior architectural feature" is any portion of the interior of a public space in a publicly owned building, or of a space in a privately-owned building designated or listed at the request of the owner, where the space is generally accessible for use and viewing by the general public. The feature must meet the criteria for historic significance in accordance with the criteria for designation as provided in this chapter. Proposed changes to designated historic interior spaces must follow the same procedures outlined in this chapter for alteration to exterior features. 
18.  "Local register" is a list of properties officially designated or recognized as historically significant by the city of Morgan Hill pursuant to a local ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council. 
19.  "Location" is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the historic event occurred. 
20.  "Object" is a material thing of functional, aesthetic, cultural, historical or scientific value that may be, by design or nature, moveable yet related to a specific setting or environment. 
21.  "Potentially significant historical resource" is a resource that is identified through a reconnaissance survey and/or by the city to have (a) age and (b) integrity but historical significance has not yet been evaluated or determined. 
22.  "Preservation" is defined as the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity and materials of an historical resource. Work including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the resource generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new construction. 
23.  "Reconnaissance survey" is a preliminary historic survey used of a defined geographic area, which identifies resources warranting further evaluation to determine historical significance, and which may also identify geographic areas and/or properties that do not have potential historical resources and will not be subject to historic review as long as the timeframe of the reconnaissance survey remains valid for such determination. A reconnaissance survey will generally include DPR 523 primary record survey forms (DPR 523A) or equivalent information for those resources determined to warrant future further evaluation. 
24.  "Reconstruction" is defined as the act or process of depicting, by means of new construction, the form, features and detailing of a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure, or object for the purpose of replicating its appearance at a specific period of time and in its historic location. 
25.  "Rehabilitation" is defined as the act or process of making possible a compatible use for a resource through repair, alterations and additions while preserving those portions or features which convey its historical, cultural, or architectural value. 
26.  "Restoration" is defined as the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features and character of a resource as it appeared at a particular period in time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstructing missing features from the restoration period. 
27.  "Setting" is the physical environment of a historic property. Whereas location refers to the specific place where a property was built or an event occurred, setting refers to the character of the place in which the property played its historical role. 
28.  "Site" is the location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building, structure or landscape, whether standing, existing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archaeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure. A site can possess associative significance or information potential or both, and can be significant under any or all of the four criteria for evaluation of significance. 
29.  "Standards" are the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, which is the body of information that provides acceptable approaches for preserving, rehabilitating, restoring and reconstructing significant historical resources or potentially significant historical resources. A project that follows the Secretary's Standards is considered not to result in a significant impact to the resource under the California Environmental Quality Act(CEQA). 
30.  "Structure" is a man-made feature made of interdependent and interrelated parts in a definite pattern of organization. The term "structure" is used to distinguish from "buildings" which are constructed primarily for human shelter. If a structure has lost its historic configuration or pattern of organization through deterioration or demolition, it is usually considered a "ruin" and is categorized as a site. 
31.  "Substantial adverse change" means demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the character-defining features of an historical resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired. A project with an effect that may cause a substantial adverse change is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment under CEQA. 
32.  "Unique archaeological resource" is a type of historical resource and means an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can be clearly demonstrated that, without merely adding to the current body of knowledge, there is a high probability that it meets any of the following criteria: 
a.  Contains information needed to answer important scientific research questions and that there is a demonstrable public interest in that information. 
b.  Has a special and particular quality such as being the oldest of its type or the best available example of its type. 
c.  Is directly associated with a scientifically recognized important prehistoric or historic event or person. 
33.  "Workmanship" is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any given period in history or prehistory. 
B.  Terms Not Defined. Terms not defined in this section shall be interpreted so as to give this chapter its most reasonable meaning and application. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.60.030 - Identification of historical resources. 
A.  Citywide Reconnaissance Survey. 
1.  In 2008, the city completed a reconnaissance survey to identify potential historical resources located within the city of Morgan Hill 2007 Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). The survey process included a visual survey of over 870 properties containing structures at least forty-five years in age. From the over 870 properties, 126 DPR 523A primary record survey forms were completed for properties appearing to maintain historic integrity. The reconnaissance survey will be used to exclude properties from further historic evaluation and to identify those properties requiring a full evaluation as defined in this chapter, as part of future development proposals, to determine historical significance. 
2.  The city of Morgan Hill may periodically update the citywide reconnaissance survey and/or survey additional properties located within the city limits, urban growth boundary, urban limit line, or sphere of influence boundary, for the purposes of identifying those properties or geographic areas that are determined not to be or contain potentially significant historical resources, as well as to identify those properties or areas that may contain potentially significant historical resources and will require additional evaluation in order to make determinations of age, integrity and/or significance. 
3.  The city of Morgan Hill will maintain a comprehensive record of reconnaissance surveys, evaluations and historic reports completed for properties located within the city limits, urban growth boundary and/or sphere of influence, including those completed as part of the 2008 Reconnaissance Survey and those submitted by individual applicants. 
B.  Local Register of Designated Historical Resources. The city of Morgan Hill will maintain a local register of designated historical resources consisting of resources determined by the city council to possess age, integrity and significance. The city of Morgan Hill will also maintain an adopted survey list identifying resources considered to be significant to Morgan Hill but not officially designated or listed on the local register. For the purposes of this chapter, an object, building, structure, site, area, district, unique archaeological resource, place, record, or manuscript may be classified a designated historical resource and placed on the local register by the planning commission pursuant to Section 2.36.040 if it is determined through survey and documentation to be a "historical resource" as defined in this chapter, which are determined to have (a) age, (b) integrity and (c) historical significance as defined by this chapter 
C.  Archaeological Sensitivity Maps. The city of Morgan Hill may publish or adopt archaeological sensitivity maps and/or may request the assistance of the Northwest Information Center, which is the area's historical resources information system located at Sonoma State University, for information about known archaeological sites, or about potential historic or prehistoric resources that may be determined to be significant or unique. 
D.  Site Specific Evaluations. The city of Morgan Hill may require project applicants to retain qualified consultants to prepare evaluations that can be used by the city to determine whether a property or site is a potentially significant or a significant historical resource, as part of development review and/or environmental review processes. The city may require a peer review by the city's historic consultant of any evaluation report submitted directly by an applicant. Reconnaissance surveys and evaluations shall use the adopted Morgan Hill Historic Context Statement as a tool for understanding whether and why the property is significant. A resource must be associated with an important historical context and retain integrity of those features necessary to convey that significance. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.60.040 - Local register designation process. 
Historical resources and historic districts shall be designated and placed on the local register by the planning commission as follows: 
A.  Request for Designation. The city of Morgan Hill or any property owner may request the designation of a significant or potentially significant historical resource or the designation of a historic district by submitting an application for such designation to the planning commission. The community development director, planning commission or city council may also initiate such proceedings on their own motion. 
B.  Study. The community development director will conduct a study of the proposed designation and make a preliminary determination based on such documentation as may be required, as to the appropriateness for designation. If the community development director determines the application merits consideration, the community development director shall forward such analysis and recommendation to the planning commission at a public hearing to consider designation of the historical resource or historic district.

This chapter applies to existing parcels, uses, and structures that do not conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. Nonconforming signs are subject to the requirements in Chapter 18.88 (Signs). 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.030 - General. 
A.  Continuation. A nonconforming parcel, use, or structure may be continued if it was legally established in compliance with all applicable regulations in effect at the time it was established. 
B.  Legally Established Defined. To be considered legally established, a legal nonconforming parcel, use, or structure shall have been physically constructed or in existence, not merely contemplated. Conditional use permits, variances, building permits, or other permits not exercised within the required time do not establish legal nonconforming status. 
C.  Burden of Proof. Any person asserting a right to a nonconforming use or structure has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the nonconformity was legally established. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.040 - Nonconforming parcels. 
A.  Development Permitted. Legally established parcels with nonconforming dimensions (e.g., parcel width and depth) shall be permitted all development rights of the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  Conformance with Standards. Development on legal nonconforming parcels shall comply with all setback, building coverage, parking, and other standards of the applicable zoning district, except as allowed by Subsection C below. 
C.  Multi-Family Density. On legally established existing lots which do not comply with minimum area standards, the maximum density of a multi-family use shall be five percent less than normally required in the applicable zoning district. For example, in a zoning district with a maximum density of twenty units per acre, the maximum density for a multi-family use on a lot that does not comply with the minimum area standard shall be nineteen units per acre. 
D.  Boundary Adjustments. The boundaries of a nonconforming parcel may not be adjusted in any way that decreases the parcel area or reduces the parcel width or depth. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.050 - Nonconforming use of land. 
A.  Continuation Permitted. A nonconforming use of land may continue so long as: 
1.  The nonconforming use is not enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land; and 
2.  The nonconforming use is not moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel. 
B.  Cessation of Use. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of more than ninety days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.060 - Nonconforming use of structures. 
A.  Change in Ownership, Tenancy, or Management. A change in ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its legal nonconforming status. 
B.  Resuming a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use changed to a conforming use shall not return to a nonconforming use. 
C.  Replacement of a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may not be replaced by another nonconforming use. 
D.  Intensification of Use. 
1.  The enlargement of a structure or site occupied by a nonconforming use, or the intensification in any way of the operation of a nonconforming use, shall require the approval of an administrative use permit. 
2.  To approve a proposed intensification to a nonconforming use, the community development director shall make all administrative use permit findings (Section 18.108.020) in addition to the findings in Section 18.68.080 (Findings). 
E.  Discontinuation of Use. A nonconforming use discontinued for six consecutive months or for twelve months during any two-year period shall not be reestablished and may be replaced only by a conforming use. 
F.  Uses Without Required Permits. A legally established use which is allowed in a zoning district but which lacks a required permit (e.g., administrative use permit, conditional use permit) shall be considered a nonconforming use until the use receives the permit as required by the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.070 - Nonconforming structures. 
This section identifies allowed modifications to nonconforming structures, summarized in Table 18.68-1. 
Table 18.68-1: Allowed Modifications to Nonconforming Structures 
Project Affecting a Nonconforming Structure 	Permit Required [1] 
Nonstructural repairs, maintenance, and interior alterations 	None 
Structural repairs, modifications, and additions that do not alter or affect the nonconforming aspect of the structure 	None 
Structural repairs, modifications, and additions that alter or affect the nonconforming aspect of the structure 	Design Permit 
Structural repairs, modifications, and additions that increase or exacerbate the nonconforming aspect of the structure 	Variance 
Reconstruction of an involuntarily damaged or destroyed residential structure 	Design Permit 
 
Notes: 
[1] The proposed project may require permits and approvals for other reasons not related to its nonconforming status. For example, additions or enlargements to a single-family dwelling often requires a design permit. 
A.  Alterations Permitted By-Right. 
1.  Maintenance, nonstructural repairs, and nonstructural interior alterations to any portion of a nonconforming structure are permitted if the changes and improvements do not enlarge or extend the structure. 
2.  Structural modifications to a nonconforming structure that do not alter or affect the nonconforming aspect of the structure are permitted. For example, an addition to a structure with a non-conforming setback is permitted if no structural changes are made to the portion of the structure projecting into the required setback, and if the addition complies with all setback, height, floor area ratio, and other applicable development standards. 
B.  Alterations Requiring a Design Permit. 
1.  Structural repairs and improvements that affect the nonconforming aspect of a nonconforming structure are allowed with a design permit if the improvement does not increase or exacerbate the nonconformity. For example, structural repairs to a building wall within a required setback are permitted with a design permit if the wall is not moved closer to the property line and the length of the wall within the required setback is not increased. 
2.  To approve such an alteration, the community development director shall make all design permit findings (Section 18.108.040) in addition to the findings in Section 18.68.080 (Findings). 
C.  Alterations Requiring a Variance. 
1.  Alterations to a non-conforming structure that increase or exacerbate the nonconformity requires a variance. For example, a remodel that increases the length of an existing building wall located within a required setback is allowed only with the approval of a variance. 
2.  To approve such an alteration, the planning commission shall make all variance findings (Section 18.108.100) in addition to the findings in Section 18.68.080 (Findings). 
D.  Damage or Destruction. Except as allowed by Subsection E below, a nonconforming structure damaged or destroyed for any reason shall be brought into full compliance with the requirements of the zoning code if the cost of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent of its market value as determined by the county assessor on the last equalized assessment roll at the time of its destruction. 
E.  Involuntary Damage or Destruction  Residential Structures. 
1.  If a legally established nonconforming building occupied by a residential use is damaged or destroyed by earthquake, fire, flood, or other calamity, the structure may be reconstructed as it existed and may be continued as a legal nonconforming structure with the approval of a design permit. 
2.  "Reconstructed" means rebuilding a damaged or destroyed structure in a manner similar but not identical to the original structure. A reconstructed structure generally recreates the original building footprint, mass, and height, but may deviate from design details such as architectural design and the arrangement of doors, windows, and rooflines. 
3.  The city may attach conditions of approval as necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, including requirements to reduce or eliminate previously existing nonconformities. 
4.  Reconstruction of damaged or destroyed buildings may not increase or exacerbate previously existing nonconformities or create new nonconformities. 
5.  The construction of the replacement structure must begin within twenty-four months of the date of the calamity which damaged or destroyed the structure. 
F.  Moved Structures. A nonconforming structure that is moved to a new location shall conform to all standards of the applicable zoning district. 
G.  Nonconforming Screening, Fences, and Landscaping. 
1.  Legally established nonconforming screening, fences, and landscaping may continue and remain except as required by Paragraph 2 below. 
2.  For additions or renovations that increase by twenty-five percent or more the floor area or market value of one or more buildings on a property, any nonconforming screening, fences, and landscaping shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.68.080 - Findings. 
The community development director may approve an administrative use permit for a nonconforming use or structure if all of the following findings can be made in addition to the findings in Section 18.108.020 (Administrative Use Permits): 
A.  Available evidence indicates that the nonconforming use was legally established. 
B.  The nonconforming use has not resulted in a notable negative impact or nuisance to the surrounding area. 
C.  The nonconforming use is compatible with the general character of the surrounding area. 
D.  The proposed action is consistent with the purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district.

This acknowledgment runs with the land and is binding on the undersigned and all of their successors, heirs and assigns." 
D.  Revocation and Suspension. A geologic clearance may be revoked or suspended whenever the director determines that any of the following circumstances has occurred: 
1.  The geologic clearance was granted in error, was granted on the basis of incorrect or misinterpreted information, or was granted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulatory provision. 
2.  The review upon which the geologic clearance was granted was incomplete and further geologic information or analysis is necessary. 
3.  The findings made pursuant to Section 18.7045.100 are incorrect. 
4.  There is sufficient uncertainty about any geologic hazard, either on or off-site, which makes it reasonable to require further geologic evaluation. 
5.  Scientific or technological advancement, a change in geologic conditions, or previously unknown facts or geologic analysis make it reasonable to require further geologic evaluation. 
6.  The development proposal upon which the geologic clearance is based is modified and the geologic evaluation does not address the project as modified. 
E.  Notice. Notification of the denial of the geologic clearance, the issuance of such geologic clearance with conditions, or the revocation or suspension of such geologic clearance, shall be mailed to applicant, postage prepaid, at the address given for purposes of such notice on the application. 
F.  Appeal. The applicant may appeal the denial, revocation or suspension of the geologic clearance or any condition imposed on the geologic clearance pursuant to the applicable appellate provisions set forth in Chapter 18.64112 (Appeals) of this code. 
G.  Issuance of Geologic Clearance. No geologic clearance shall be issued unless the director, based on an independent review of a geologic report, finds that the nature and severity of the seismic and geologic hazards at the project site have been adequately evaluated in a geologic report and appropriate mitigation measures have been proposed. For the purpose of the review, the director shall consult with a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city, who will advise whether the site-specific investigation is sufficiently thorough, the findings regarding identified hazards are valid, and the proposed mitigation measures achieve an acceptable level of risk. The issuance of a geologic clearance shall not be construed as a determination that the project site is free from any geologic hazard. Such clearance shall mean only that based on the information provided, it is the judgment of the director or the city that any geologic hazard or risk will be mitigated to an acceptable level of risk as defined in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)

18.70.060 - Waiver of geologic and seismic hazards investigation report requirement. 
A.  For a specific project, the director may waive the requirements for a geologic report under Section 18.7045.090 if he or she finds and determines that the geologic or geotechnical conditions at the project site are such that public safety is adequately protected and no mitigation is required. This finding shall be based on the recommendation and advice of a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city, or based on a report prepared by a qualified geologist presenting evaluation of sites in the immediate vicinity having similar geologic and geotechnical characteristics which shall be reviewed in the same manner as a review of a geologic report set forth in Section 18.7045.090. The director shall set forth such determination in writing, citing the reasons for a waiver. For any waiver of the requirement for a geologic report granted for a project located in an area identified as state seismic hazard zones, the Director shall also require a report prepared by a qualified geologist, and provide a written commentary that addresses the report conclusions and justifications for applying the conclusions contained in the report to the project site. The director shall record such waiver with the county recorder and file a separate copy, together with the report and commentary, with the state geologist within thirty days of the waiver. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A above, if a project consists of single-family wood-frame or steel-frame dwelling(s) not exceeding two stories when that dwelling is not part of a development of four or more dwellings, then the director may waive the requirement for a geologic report under Section 18.7045.090 if, based on the advice and recommendation of a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city, he or she determines that no geologic hazard(s) exists. The director shall set forth such determination in writing, citing the reasons for a waiver. 
C.  The director may also waive any or all requirements under Sections 18.7045.110 and 18.7045.120 for any project that is not a sensitive use if he or she determines, with consultation with a qualified geologist employed or retained by the city, that such requirement(s) are not necessary to make the finding or determination under Section 18.7045.090. 
D.  The director may condition any waiver granted pursuant to this chapter with the following: 
1.  The existing public storm drainage system has sufficient capacity, as determined by the city engineer, to convey present and future storm water runoff.

Chapter 18.72 - PARKING AND LOADING 
 
18.72.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes on-site parking and loading requirements in order to: 
A.  Provide a sufficient number of on-site parking spaces for all land uses. 
B.  Provide for functional on-site parking areas that are safe for vehicles and pedestrians. 
C.  Ensure that parking areas are well-designed and contribute to a high-quality design environment in Morgan Hill. 
D.  Allow for flexibility in on-site parking requirements to support a multi-modal transportation system and sustainable development pattern. 
E.  Ensure that on-site parking areas do not adversely impact land uses on neighboring properties. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.72.020 - Applicability. 
A.  New Buildings and Uses. On-site parking and loading as required by this chapter shall be provided anytime a new building is constructed or a land use is established where no land use previously existed. 
B.  Change of Use. Where an existing use is changed to a new use, parking shall be provided for the incremental intensification of the new use. For example, if a new use requiring five on-site parking spaces replaces an existing use requiring four on-site parking spaces, the new use must provide one additional parking space regardless of the number of on-site parking spaces provided by the existing use. 
C.  Expansions and Enlargements. Where an existing structure is expanded or enlarged, additional parking is required to serve only the expanded or enlarged area. Additional parking is not required to remedy parking deficiencies existing prior to the expansion or enlargement.

18.72.050 - On-site parking alternatives. 
A.  Purpose. This section identifies alternatives to required on-site parking to: 
1.  Allow for creative parking solutions; 
2.  Enhance economic vitality in Morgan Hill; 
3.  Promote walking, biking, and use of transit; and 
4.  Encourage the efficient use of land resources consistent with the general plan. 
B.  Required Approval. Unless otherwise indicated, all reductions in on-site parking described in this section require planning commission approval of a conditional use permit. 
C.  In-Lieu Payments. Within the MU-D and MU-N zoning districts, on-site parking requirements may be satisfied by payment of an in-lieu parking fee consistent with the city's Downtown in-lieu fee parking program. 
D.  Off-Site Parking. 
1.  For multi-family housing and non-residential uses, the planning commission may allow off-site parking if the commission finds that practical difficulties prevent the parking from being located on the same lot it is intended to serve. 
2.  On-site parking shall be located within a reasonable distance of the use it is intended to serve, as determined by the planning commission. 
3.  A covenant record, approved by the city attorney, shall be filed with the county recorder. The covenant record shall require the owner of the property where the on-site parking is located to continue to maintain the parking space so long as the building, structure, or improvement is maintained in Morgan Hill. This covenant shall stipulate that the title and right to use the parcels shall not be subject to multiple covenant or contract for use without prior written consent of the city. 
E.  Consolidated Parking. 
1.  The required on-site parking for multiple uses may be consolidated into one central parking area located within the same block or within three hundred feet of any individual use. 
2.  The number of parking spaces required shall be the sum total of the required parking for each individual use unless the city approves a shared parking reduction in accordance with Section 18.72.050.F (Shared Parking). 
F.  Shared Parking. Multiple land uses on a single parcel or development site may use shared parking facilities when operations for the land uses are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use differ. The planning commission may allow shared parking if: 
1.  The parking will be shared by non-residential land uses only; 
2.  A parking demand study approved by the community development director demonstrates that there will be no substantial conflicts between the land uses' principal hours of operation and periods of peak parking demand; 
3.  The total number of parking spaces required for the land uses does not exceed the number of parking spaces anticipated at periods of maximum use; and 
4.  The proposed shared parking facility is located no further than four hundred feet from the primary entrance of the land use which it serves. 
G.  Valet Parking. The planning commission may allow up to twenty-five percent of the required on-site parking spaces to be valet spaces. Valet parking shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Valet parking lots must be staffed at all times by an attendant who is authorized and able to move vehicles. 
2.  A valet parking plan shall be reviewed and approved by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. 
3.  Valet parking may not interfere with or obstruct vehicle or pedestrian circulation on the site or on any public street or sidewalk. 
4.  The use served by valet parking shall provide a designated drop-off and pick-up area. The drop-off and pick-up area may be located adjacent to the building, but it may not be located within a fire lane, impede vehicular and/or pedestrian circulation, or cause queuing in the right-of-way or drive aisle. 
H.  Low Demand. The number of required on-site parking spaces may be reduced if the planning commission finds that the land use will not utilize the required number of spaces due to the nature of the specific use. This finding shall be supported by the results of a parking demand study approved by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. 
I.  Transportation Demand Management Plan. The planning commission may reduce the number of required on-site parking spaces for employers that adopt and implement a transportation demand management (TDM) plan subject to the following requirements and limitations: 
1.  A TDM Plan reduction is available only to employers with twenty-five or more employees. 
2.  Required on-site parking spaces may be reduced by no more than fifteen percent. 
3.  The TDM plan shall be approved by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. 
4.  The TDM plan shall identify specific measures that will measurably reduce the demand for on-site parking spaces. 
5.  The employer shall appoint a program coordinator to oversee transportation demand management activities. 
6.  The program coordinator must provide a report annually to the planning commission that details the implementation strategies and effectiveness of the TDM plan. 
7.  The planning commission may revoke the TDM plan at any time and require additional parking spaces on site upon finding that that the plan has not been implemented as required or that the plan has not produced the reduction the demand for on-site parking spaces as originally intended.

(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.96.020 - Definitions. 
A.  Terms Defined. Terms used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
1.  "Amateur radio facilities" are antennas and related equipment for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication, or technical investigations carried out by an amateur radio operator who operates without commercial interest, and who holds a written authorization from the Federal Communications Commission to operate an amateur radio facility. 
2.  "Antenna" means a device or system of wires, poles, rods, dishes, discs, or similar devices used to transmit and/or receive radio or electromagnetic waves. 
3.  "Applicable FCC decisions" means the same as defined by California Government Code Section 65964.1(d)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as "In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994 (2009) and In the Matter of Acceleration of Broadband Deployment by Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd. 12865 (2014)." 
4.  "Array" means one or more antennas mounted at approximately the same level above ground on tower or base station. 
5.  "Base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment that enables wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. Examples include wireless facilities mounted on a building or façade, ground-mounted equipment, facilities mounted to a utility pole or light standard, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, power supplies, and comparable equipment regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems (DAS) and small-cell networks). The term does not include "towers" or tower-mounted equipment as defined below. 
6.  "Collocation" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[t]he mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes." As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition effectively means "to add" new equipment to an existing facility and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site. 
7.  "Distributed Antenna System" or "DAS" means a network of one or more antennas and related fiber optic nodes typically mounted to or located on streetlight poles, utility poles, sporting venues, arenas or convention centers which provide access and signal transfer for wireless service providers. A distributed antenna system also includes the equipment location, sometimes called a "hub" or "hotel" where the DAS network is interconnected with one or more wireless service provider's facilities to provide the signal transfer services. 
8.  "Eligible facilities request." See Section 18.96.060.B (Eligible Facilities Request Defined). 
9.  "Eligible support structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)4), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny tower or base station as defined in [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001], provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001]."

(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.96.060 - Section 6409(a) modifications. 
A.  Purpose. This section describes the process and requirements for the approval of an "eligible facilities request" that does not cause a "substantial change" to an existing facility as defined by FCC regulations. 
B.  Eligible Facilities Request Defined. "Eligible facilities request" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as a request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the tower or base station, involving 
1.  Collocation of new transmission equipment; 
2.  Removal of transmission equipment; or 
3.  Replacement of transmission equipment. 
C.  Substantial Change Defined. "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, defined according to the facility type and location as follows: 
1.  Towers Outside the Public Right-of-Way. For towers outside the public right-of-way, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than twenty feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site. 
2.  Monopoles in the Public Right-of-Way. For monopoles in the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless monopoles; or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent (ten percent) larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 
e.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 
3.  All Towers and Base Stations. In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the community development director; or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section. 
4.  Interpretation of Thresholds. 
a.  The thresholds for a substantial change described above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. 
b.  The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a). 
D.  Permit Required. Approval of an eligible facilities request as defined above requires community development director approval of a Section 6409(a) Permit. 
E.  Applications. Applications for a Section 6409(a) Permit shall contain all information and materials specified in Section 18.96.050.B (Application Contents) except as follows: 
1.  Section 6409(a) Permit applications are not required to include a statement of purpose (Section 18.96.050.B.1) or an alternative sites analysis (Section 18.96.050.B.5). 
2.  The application must include a detailed explanation as to why the applicant believes that the application qualifies as an eligible facility request subject to a Section 6409(a) Permit. 
3.  For applications involving a collocation or modification to an eligible support structure, the application must be accompanied by all prior approvals for the existing facility (including but not limited to all conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment), as well as all permit applications with required application materials for each separate permit required by the city for the proposed facility, including but not limited to a building permit and an encroachment permit (if applicable). 
F.  Public Notice. Before the community development director may approve a Section 6409(a) Permit application, notice of the application shall be posted on site at least ten calendar days prior to the city taking action on the application and shall contain the following information: 
1.  A general explanation of the proposed modification or collocation; 
2.  A general description of the location of the real property that is the subject of the application; and 
3.  The following statement: "Federal law may require approval of this application pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a)." 
G.  Basis for Approval. 
1.  This subsection shall be interpreted and applied so as to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 6409(a), and the applicable FCC and court decisions and determinations relating to the same. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction invalidates all or any portion of Section 6409(a) or a FCC rule or regulation that interprets Section 6409(a), such that federal law would not mandate approval for any eligible facilities request, then all proposed modifications to existing facilities subject to this section must be approved by an administrative use permit, or conditional use permit, as applicable, and subject to the discretion of the community development director. 
2.  The community development director shall approve a Section 6409(a) Permit upon finding that the proposed collocation or modification qualifies as an eligible facilities request and does not cause a substantial change as defined above. 
3.  In addition to any other alternative recourse permitted under federal law, the community development director may deny a Section 6409(a) permit upon finding that the proposed collocation or modification: 
a.  Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health and safety; 
b.  Involves a structure constructed or modified without all regulatory approvals required at the time of the construction or modification; 
c.  Involves the replacement of the entire support structure; or 
d.  Does not qualify for mandatory approval under Section 6409(a) for any lawful reason. 
4.  A denial of a Section 6409(a) permit application shall be without prejudice to the applicant, the real property owner, or the project. Subject to the application and submittal requirements in this chapter, the applicant may immediately resubmit a permit application for either a conditional use permit, administrative use permit, or Section 6409(a) permit as appropriate. 
H.  Appeals. Community development director decisions on a Section 6409(a) Permit are final and may not be appealed. 
I.  No Permit Term Extension. 
1.  The approval of a Section 6409(a) permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. 
2.  A Section 6409(a) permit does not extend the permit term for any conditional use permit, administrative use permit, or other underlying regulatory approval and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit for the subject tower or base station. 
J.  Applicant Notifications for Deemed Granted Remedies. 
1.  Under state and/or federal law, the city's failure to act on a wireless communications facility permit application within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions, accounting for tolling, may result in the permit being deemed granted by operation of law. 
2.  To the extent federal or state law provides a "deemed granted" remedy for wireless communications facility applications not timely acted upon by the city, no such application shall be deemed granted unless and until the applicant satisfies the following requirements: 
a.  Submits a complete application package consistent with the application procedures specified in this chapter and applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 
b.  Following the date by which the city must take final action on the application (as determined in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions and accounting for tolling), the applicant must provide notice to the city that the application is deemed granted by operation of law. 
K.  Accelerated Permit Terms Due to Invalidation. 
1.  In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for any Section 6409(a) permit, the permit or permits issued in connection with such 6409(a) modification(s) shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order. 
2.  A permit holder is not required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated Section 6409(a) permit if the permit holder submits an application for a conditional use permit or administrative use permit for those improvements before the one-year period ends. 
L.  No Waiver of Standing. The approval of a Section 6409(a) permit shall not be construed to waive any standing by the City to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any Section 6409(a) modification. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018; Ord. No. 2301 N.S., § 2, 4-17-2019)

A.  Inspections and Emergencies. The city or its designee may enter onto the facility area to inspect the facility upon reasonable notice to the permit holder. The permit holder shall cooperate with all inspections. The city or its designee may enter the facility and support, repair, disable or remove any elements of the facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property. 
B.  Contact Information for Responsible Parties. The permit holder shall at all times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address and email address for at least one natural person.

If a permit holder fails to remove a discontinued facility, the city may remove or cause to remove the facility at the permit holder's sole expense. 
E.  Change in Federal or State Regulations. All facilities shall meet the current standards and regulations of the FCC, the California Public Utilities Commission, and any other agency of the federal or state government with the authority to regulate wireless communications providers. If such standards and/or regulations are changed, the wireless communications provider shall bring its facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within ninety days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency. Failure to a bring wireless communications facility into compliance with revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the immediate removal of the facility at the wireless communications provider's expense. 
F.  RF Exposure Compliance. All facilities shall comply with all standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government agency with the authority to regulate radio frequency (RF) exposure standards. Under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the city may not deny an application for a wireless telecommunications facility due to perceived health risks if the proposed facility complies with Federal RF exposure standards.

1.  A significant gap in the applicant's service coverage exists; 
2.  All alternative sites identified in the application review process are either technically infeasible or not potentially available; and 
3.  Permit denial would effectively prohibit personal wireless services in Morgan Hill.

c.  Identify information and materials the city will require with the application, and any necessary technical studies and information relating to the environmental review of the project; and 
d.  Provide guidance to the applicant of possible project alternatives or modifications. 
3.  The pre-application conference and any information provided to prospective applicants by city staff shall not be construed as a recommendation for approval or denial of an application. 
4.  Failure by city staff to identify all permit requirements shall not constitute a waiver of those requirements. 
B.  Application Contents. 
1.  All permit applications shall be filed with the development services department on an official city application form. 
2.  Applications shall be filed with all required fees, information, and materials as specified by the development services department.

18.116.020 - Applications. 
An applicant for a development project may request that the city review a development agreement application in accordance with the following procedures. As used in this chapter, "applicant" means a person who has a legal or equitable interest in real property, and who applies for a development agreement for a project on that property in accordance with this chapter, and who executes and is bound by the terms of the development agreement. "Applicant" also includes a successor in interest to the rights and duties of the original applicant for a development agreement. 
A.  Forms and Information. The applicant shall submit a development agreement application on a form prescribed by the community development director. The director shall identify submittal requirements for development agreement applications, and may require an applicant to submit additional information and supporting data to process the application. 
B.  Fees. At the time of initial filing of the application, the applicant shall pay fees and charges required to file and process the development agreement applications and to administer the approved development agreements, including annual reviews, in such amounts as established by resolution of the city council. 
C.  Authority to File Application. An applicant shall have a legal or equitable interest in the real property which is the subject of the proposed development agreement. The community development director shall require an applicant to submit proof of his or her interest in the real property and/or of the authority of any agent to act for the applicant. Such proof may include a title report, policy or guarantee, issued by a title company licensed to do business in the state, which demonstrates the required interest of the applicant in the real property. 
D.  Initial Review of Application. 
1.  The community development director, or his or her designee, shall review each application to determine whether it is complete. If the application is found to be incomplete, the community development director shall reject the application and, within forty-five days after submittal of the application, shall inform the applicant of the items or steps necessary to complete the application. 
2.  Following completion of the application, the community development director shall determine whether a project is consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan, including the precise development plan and guidelines of a planned unit development (PUD) district, or if the applicant has submitted an application for any necessary amendments to the general plan, PUD, or specific plan. 
3.  In addition, the community development director shall determine whether the project meets one of the following criteria: 
a.  The project is a residential development awarded a building allotment pursuant to Chapter 18.78 (Residential Development Control System) of Municipal Code Title 18 (Development Code); or 
b.  The project is a commercial or industrial development and these three criteria are met: 
(1)  The project site is three acres or more in area, and 
(2)  The project proposes to construct or rehabilitate multiple structures on the site, and the total floor area to be constructed or rehabilitated is at least one hundred thousand square feet, and 
(3)  The project envisions a long-term or phased build-out such that, at the time of application, designs of all buildings and improvements cannot be reasonably specified in the manner required of use permit applications; or the project is a commercial or industrial development and there are other unique or compelling reasons why the project or the potential benefits to the community would warrant consideration in the form of a development agreement. 
4.  The community development director shall also determine whether the proposed project comports with regulations of the zoning district in which the property lies, including identification of any aspects of the project which would require a variance were the application subject to review and action under the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.116.030 - Contents of development agreements. 
Following completion of the application and determination by the community development director that the application meets the criteria described above, the city manager, or his or her designee, shall provide the applicant with the city's standard development agreement.

3.  Proposals to achieve general plan goals not directly associated with the private project; and 
4.  Other proposals which, in the judgment of the planning commission and city council, provide public benefits sufficient to justify a development agreement. 
D.  A development agreement should include requirements for construction and maintenance of onsite and off-site improvements or payment of fees in lieu of such dedications or improvements. 
E.  A development agreement should include any conditions and restrictions imposed by the city with respect to the project, including conditions and restrictions proposed in the environmental review document prepared under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in order to eliminate or mitigate potential adverse environmental impacts of the project. 
F.  A development agreement may provide that the project be constructed in specified phases, and may state construction shall commence within a specified time, and that the project or any phase thereof shall be completed within a specified time. 
G.  A development agreement shall be a contract that is negotiated and voluntarily entered into by city and applicant and may contain any additional or modified conditions, terms or provisions agreed upon by the parties.

Division II. - Development and Conservation  
Chapter 18.132 - HABITAT CONSERVATION 
 
18.132.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this Chapter 18.132 is to implement the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan ("HCP/NCCP") and the associated implementing agreement and take permits in order to provide a regulatory framework for promoting the protection and recovery of natural resources, including covered species, while streamlining the permitting process for both publicly funded and privately funded planned development in the City of Morgan Hill. The HCP/NCCP was developed by the county of Santa Clara, the cities of Gilroy and Morgan Hill, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (collectively the "local partners") under the guidance of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game, and in consultation with stakeholder groups and the general public. 
B.  As a result of the adoption of the HCP/NCCP by the city, the city (among the other local partners) is the recipient of long-term endangered species permits/authorized take coverage from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game for the city's own activities. In addition to coverage of its own public projects, the county will be able to extend authorized Take coverage to private project applicants under its jurisdiction. 
C.  Rather than separately permitting and mitigating individual projects, the HCP/NCCP evaluates natural resource impacts and mitigation requirements comprehensively in a manner that is more efficient and effective for at-risk species and their essential habitats. This approach allows the city to streamline mitigation requirements into one comprehensive program. The take coverage authorized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") and the California Department of Fish and Game ("CDFG") also provides assurances that no further commitments of funds, land, or water will be required to address impacts on covered species beyond that described in the HCP/NCCP to address changed circumstances as long as the HCP/NCCP is properly implemented. 
D.  In addition to strengthening local control over land use and species protection, the HCP/NCCP provides a more efficient process for protecting natural resources by creating new habitat reserves that will be larger in scale, more ecologically valuable, and easier to manage than the individual mitigation sites created under the current approach. This more efficient and streamlined approach to obtaining authorized take coverage for both public and private projects will significantly reduce the time and resources previously required to obtain Take coverage on an individual project-by-project basis. All covered activities that occur within the local plan area will be subject to applicable conditions and fees described in the HCP/NCCP unless the CDFG and USFWS have determined that the activity is not subject to, has already received the necessary take authorizations pursuant to, or has otherwise complied with federal and state endangered species laws, as verified by the implementing entity and described in Chapter 6.2 of the HCP/NCCP. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)

Where: 
MAWA = maximum applied water allowance (gallons per year) 
ETo = reference evapotranspiration (inches per year) 
0.62 = conversion factor (to gallons) 
0.55 = reference evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for residential areas 
0.45 = reference evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for non-residential areas 
LA = landscape area including SLA (square feet) 
0.45 = additional water allowance for SLA in residential areas 
0.55 = additional water allowance for SLA in non-residential areas 
SLA = special landscape area (square feet) 
G.  A local agency or project applicant may consider effective precipitation (Twenty-five percent of annual precipitation) in tracking water use and may use the following equation to calculate the MAWA: 
MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential areas. 
MAWA = (ETo - EPPT) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for non-residential areas. 
H.  Estimated total water use (ETWU) will be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the ETWU calculated for all hydrozones will not exceed the MAWA. 
  
Where: 
ETWU = estimated total water use per year (gallons) 
ETo = reference evapotranspiration (inches) 
PF = plant factor from WUCOLS (see Section 491) 
HA = hydrozone area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square feet) 
0.75 = irrigation efficiency (IE) for overhead spray devices 
0.81 = irrigation efficiency (IE) for drip system devices 
SLA = special landscape area (square feet) 
0.62 = conversion factor

Chapter 18.152 - AGRICULTURAL MITIGATION 
 
18.152.010 - Agricultural lands preservation program. 
The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "agricultural lands preservation program" of the city of Morgan Hill. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.020 - Purpose. 
A.  The city of Morgan Hill has determined that small-scale agriculture is viable in the Morgan Hill sphere of influence (SOI) if land use tools are used effectively to protect an adequate agricultural land use supply. Establishing land use policies and an implementation program to preserve agricultural lands will help to preserve open space, provide access to locally grown foods, promote sustainable food production, contribute to a unique cultural environment within Morgan Hill, and address regional land use planning policy objectives. For Morgan Hill, an effective agricultural preservation program will need to focus upon the use of agricultural land use easements supported by agricultural preservation land use policies. 
B.  The Morgan Hill agricultural lands preservation program is intended to promote continued and viable agricultural activities in and around Morgan Hill through a comprehensive set of land use policies and implementation activities that together accomplish the following: 
1.  Preserve open space agricultural lands and agricultural activity within the Morgan Hill sphere of influence. 
2.  Promote the viability of small-scale agriculture through the preservation of agricultural land and the implementation of supporting general plan policies. 
3.  Identify the combination of tools, techniques, mechanisms, and funding sources that form the best agricultural/open space land preservation program for the city of Morgan Hill. 
4.  Establish CEQA mitigation procedures to mitigate the loss of agricultural lands. 
5.  Focus land preservation in the city's southeast quadrant 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.030 - Definitions. 
The following terms when used in this chapter shall have the following respective meanings: 
A.  Agricultural Land. For "agricultural land" that requires off-setting preservation/mitigation under this agricultural lands preservation program, agricultural land is defined as land that is depicted on the 2010 map of the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) of the California Department of Conservation as Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, Unique Farmland, and Farmland of Local Importance and that was not subsequently developed for non-agricultural use prior to August 1, 2014 or subsequently developed per the provisions of this ordinance. Lands identified as grazing land are not subject to the offsetting preservation/mitigation requirements set forth in this policy. 
B.  Agricultural Conservation Easement. An agricultural conservation easement is a specific type of easement whose purpose is to enable the encumbered property to remain in productive agricultural use by preventing any use or activity that would diminish or impair the agriculturally productive capacity. Therefore, the terms of an agricultural- conservation easement restrict the use of the encumbered property to agriculture, while prohibiting development, subdivision, and commercial use of the property other than as agriculture. Agricultural conservation easements are perpetual, running with the land so that their terms are binding on all future fee-title owners of the property. 
C.  Agricultural Mitigation Land. Agricultural land (as defined above) that is encumbered by an agricultural conservation easement or other farmland conservation mechanism acceptable to the city. If the agricultural land is also being used to meet open agricultural land preservation goals, the easement or other mechanism must ensure that at least ninety percent of any property being used as agricultural mitigation land remain as open space free of structures or other impervious surfaces so that it retains its value as agricultural land under the FMMP criteria. Uses allowed on agricultural mitigation land shall be consistent with the agricultural use described below and pertaining land use regulations, and as further defined in the applicable agricultural conservation easement or other farmland conservation mechanism. 
D.  Agricultural Priority Area. The agricultural priority area is an area within the SEQ that has been identified within the agricultural lands preservation program as a priority location to preserve and encourage the long-term viability of agriculture and open agricultural lands, recognizing both the vital contributions agriculture makes to the economy and quality of life within the county and the community preference for maintenance of open space areas. By designating this area, the program identifies those lands within the Morgan Hill SOI most suitable for agricultural production and related uses. Designating the agricultural priority area provides stability for ongoing agricultural operations and supports new uses necessary to support a viable local agriculture industry. The agricultural priority area is also intended to retain in open space uses any lands that are not being actively farmed until agricultural activities resume on those lands. 
E.  Agricultural Use. Agricultural use is defined as the use of the land for agricultural purposes, including crops, or crop trees, including floriculture, horticulture, viticulture, crops grown within greenhouses or other buildings, vineyards, crop harvesting, raising of animals (including apiaries, aviaries, dairying, pasturage, and fish farms), and grazing, and including necessary accessory uses for packing, processing, treating or storing of produce, and consistent with the governing jurisdiction's pertaining land use regulations. Qualifying agricultural use activities may include: 
1.  Agricultural processing: Processing facilities for the handling, processing, packing, packaging, storing and shipping of agricultural commodities grown primarily in Santa Clara County. Does not include processing of meat, poultry, or animal products (butcheries), nor timber or wood processing. Does not include routine harvesting and handling activities incidental to agriculture. 
2.  Agriculturally related entertainment and commercial uses: Visitor-oriented services, sales and attractions with an agricultural theme that are conducted in conjunction with on-site agricultural uses. Such uses include but are not limited to food and retail sales, tasting rooms, reception facilities, outdoor entertainment areas. 
3.  Agricultural research: Establishments for experimental greenhouse and field growing of agricultural commodities, landscaping and seeds, including experimental use of herbicides, pesticides and other agricultural practices. Agricultural research excludes experiments involving livestock and other animals. 
4.  Dairy: Establishments where cows or goats are maintained for the production of milk or other dairy products for commercial distribution or sale. 
5.  Feed lot: Establishments primarily engaged in the fattening of livestock in a confined area. 
6.  Field research: Research activities, field studies and educational activities (e.g., student field research) that are dependent on a natural, open setting. Examples include biological, geological or atmospheric studies. 
7.  Mushroom farm: Establishments primarily used for the cultivation and subsequent distribution and sale of mushrooms. 
8.  Nursery: an area where agricultural products are grown for transplanting, for use of stock for building and grafting, or for sale on the premises. Nurseries may include sale and cultivation of ornamental trees, shrubs, and plants, and incidental sale or rental of garden and landscape materials and equipment. 
9.  Poultry and egg farms: Establishments where fowl are raised or kept in confined areas or facilities for the purpose of commercial distribution or sale of birds or eggs. 
10.  Wildlife refuge: undeveloped land kept as natural habitat for the purpose of supporting a species or multiple species of wildlife. 
11.  Wineries: Facilities for the production of wine from fruit or fruit juices through fermentation that are subject to type 02 licenses by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Wineries shall be entitled to all uses and activities provided under the type 02 license. Wineries may also include related storage, blending and bottling activities, as well as administrative offices, marketing, tours, public tasting, wholesale and retail sales of wine, and ancillary distilling of wine to produce brandy or similar distilled spirits. Wineries may include outdoor areas for picnics, gatherings and other activities incidental to wine-tasting. Incidental sale of marketing products and accessories related to the winery's brand identity, wine drinking, food paring, local agriculture and local history is also permitted. 
12.  Ancillary uses: Uses conducted subordinate to the primary agricultural use being conducted upon a property and which do not occupy in total more than ten percent of the property, including: 
a.  Direct sales of locally produced agricultural products. 
b.  One dwelling of persons regularly employed on the premises for farming or domestic duties; 
c.  Ancillary private garages and other structures for parking and storage of equipment, private stables, and other accessory buildings; 
d.  Quarters, accommodations or areas for transient labor, such as labor cabins or camps. 
F.  Agricultural Preservation In-lieu Fee. A fee paid to the city of Morgan Hill which will be credited to the city's open space fund or other city fund created for the purpose of acquiring agricultural mitigation land or transferred to a qualifying entity and used by either agency solely for the purpose of acquiring agricultural conservation easements. The program provides for an in-lieu fee in order to allow the utilization of funding from multiple sources and to maximize the city's ability to preserve open space agricultural lands within the agricultural priority area. 
G.  Agricultural Lands Preservation Program Surcharge Fee. A fee paid to the city of Morgan Hill which will be credited to the city's open space fund or other city fund created for the purpose of acquiring agricultural mitigation land or transferred to a qualifying entity and used by either agency for the purpose of administering the agricultural lands preservation program and/or to cover ongoing management and monitoring of the easements. The surcharge fee is either incorporated into the overall in-lieu fee for projects that make use of this option, or charged directly to projects which independently establish an agricultural conservation easement. 
H.  Open Agricultural Land. Open agricultural land is defined as agricultural land that is at least ninety percent free of buildings, structures or other impervious surface and therefore available for planting of outdoor crops, grazing, or other agricultural use. The city may make use of open space funding sources to acquire agricultural conservation easements where that easement specifies that the encumbered property be maintained as open agricultural land. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.040 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new development/activities under the jurisdiction of the city of Morgan Hill, including both private development and public development projects that directly result in the conversion of agricultural land (as defined above) will be required to mitigate loss of agricultural land per the provisions of this policy. This includes projects within the existing city boundaries as well as projects that propose annexation into Morgan Hill. Projects which have received discretionary land use approval prior to the adoption August 1, 2014, including completion of the CEQA process, are not subject to this policy unless specifically required as mitigation or a condition of project approval. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.050 - Mitigation ratio. 
A minimum of one acre of agricultural land (1:1 mitigation ratio) shall be preserved for each acre of agricultural land changed to a non-agricultural use. The required acreage of area to be protected through an agricultural conservation easement or agricultural preservation in-lieu fee will depend on the measurement of affected area as defined below. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.060 - "Stay ahead" provision. 
Conservation easements will be established at least at a 1:1 mitigation ratio in advance of the development of agricultural lands. Development occurs with either the issuance of grading permit or building permits that would result in the loss of agricultural land. To meet this provision the city may utilize existing open space funding to establish agricultural conservation easements, or individual projects may establish such easements in advance of development activity. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.070 - Measurement of affected area. 
Areas subject to agricultural mitigation requirements will be the developed footprint for properties with a general plan land use designation of open space, public facilities, or sports recreation/leisure. Areas proposed to be so reserved shall have an aggregated area of at least ten acres in size to qualify for exclusion from the developed footprint calculation. For the remaining land use designations of residential, commercial, and industrial, the entire site will be used for calculating the required mitigation. Disturbed footprint will include irrigated fields for proposed sports fields or facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.080 - Mitigation mechanism. 
Conversion of agricultural land will require off-setting acquisition and/or dedication of agricultural conservation easements over approved agricultural mitigation land, or payment to the city of the agricultural preservation in-lieu fee, to support agricultural preservation. In addition to land acquisition/dedication, or payment of the agricultural preservation in-lieu fee, in either case developers are also required to pay an agricultural lands preservation program surcharge fee (on a per acre basis) to cover administrative costs and ongoing management and monitoring of the easements. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.090 - Eligible mitigation lands. 
In order to meet the goals of this chapter, lands proposed to be used as agricultural mitigation shall conform to the above definitions for agricultural mitigation land and/or open agricultural land and shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Agricultural conservation easements resulting from this program shall be acquired from willing sellers only; eminent domain will not be used to acquire lands for conservation; 
B.  The property is of adequate size, configuration and location to be viable for continued agricultural use; 
C.  The land shall have access to an adequate water supply to maintain the purposes of the easement, i.e., to irrigate farmland if the converted farmland is irrigated or capable of irrigation. The water supply shall be sufficient to support ongoing agricultural uses, and the water rights on the agricultural mitigation land shall be protected in the agricultural conservation easement; 
D.  Other considerations for appropriate conserved agricultural lands include: soil type, parcel size, existing irrigation supplies, strong agricultural production history, proximity to agricultural infrastructure, proximity to the first point of processing, uses on surrounding lands, and proximity to urban areas now and into the foreseeable future; 
E.  The mitigation land shall be located within Santa Clara County; and 
F.  The mitigation land may not overlap with land being acquired as habitat mitigation by the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.100 - Ineligible mitigation lands. 
A property is ineligible to serve as agricultural mitigation if any of the circumstances below apply: 
A.  The property is currently encumbered by a conservation, flood, or other type of easement or deed restriction that legally or practicably prevents converting the property to a nonagricultural use; or 
B.  The property is currently under public ownership and will remain so in the future, except to the extent it is included within a mitigation bank that may subsequently be established by the city or other public agency; or 
C.  The property is subject to conditions that practicably prevent utilizing the property for a viable agricultural use. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.110 - Agricultural priority area. 
Dedications inside the Morgan Hill sphere of influence (SOI) will be strongly encouraged within the southeast quadrant (SEQ) as the first priority. The city has identified an agricultural priority area within the SEQ as the city's first priority for conservation. The city's secondary priority is the preservation of other rural county agricultural lands within the Morgan Hill SOI. Dedications outside the SOI are less desirable and must be inside Santa Clara County as described under 'eligible mitigation lands' above. The agricultural priority area encompasses approximately six hundred fifty acres of land. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.120 - Responsibility for easement acquisition. 
A.  In cases where the mitigation fee is paid, the city of Morgan Hill will either take on responsibility for acquiring the easement or transfer the in-lieu fee and accompanying responsibility to a qualifying entity. 
B.  Developments requiring less than ten acres of agricultural mitigation are required to pay the agricultural preservation in-lieu fee on a per acre basis except that acquisition of agricultural conservation easements of less than ten acres may be allowed when located immediately adjacent to an existing agricultural conservation easement area that when combined, exceeds ten acres in size. 
C.  Developers may independently establish an agricultural conservation easement on eligible mitigation lands within the county. In such cases, the developer will be required to pay all acquisition costs, the costs of establishing the easement, and the agricultural lands preservation program surcharge fee. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.130 - Management and monitoring fee. 
The developer shall pay a one-time per acre fee (agricultural lands preservation program surcharge fee) to cover the average cost administration of the program. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.140 - Implementing entity. 
The city will hold the easements and collect management and monitoring fees until an alternative implementing entity (qualifying entity), such as a nonprofit conservation organization or agricultural consultant, has been identified. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.150 - Mitigation timing and implementation. 
Agricultural mitigation will be required prior to the acceptance of a final parcel or subdivision map or prior to issuance of a building permit or grading permit that results in physical development involving the conversion of agricultural lands, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.160 - Planned developments/development agreements. 
Developers may provide agricultural mitigation through a planned development project that consolidates existing development rights onto a portion of the property so that the remaining undeveloped portion is then reserved for agricultural use. Such an approach may be used within the SEQ or within other areas of the city's SOI in which agricultural lands are present. Such a project must be governed by a development agreement. This method of mitigation will only be considered if it results in an equal or greater agricultural benefit as would have resulted from the mitigation measures described above. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: (1) the number, size, and location of permissible clustered home sites; (2) the amount of land dedicated for agricultural conservation; (3) the location of agricultural land in relation to the agricultural priority area and contiguity with existing and already conserved agricultural land; and (4) commitments to actively farm agricultural land within the development agreement area. The developer will be required to enter into a development agreement with the city specifying the terms of the agreement and the extraordinary benefits accruing to the city. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.170 - Funding for easements. 
Given the city's policy objective of agricultural land preservation within the Morgan Hill sphere of influence and within the southeast quadrant in particular, it is anticipated that the city will need to use multiple funding sources to support the acquisition of easements within the desired area. In addition to use of money obtain through grants and other contributions, the city will use open space funds collected through administration of its residential development control system (RDCS) to supplement the acquisition of conservation easements. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.152.180 - Clustering of development. 
The city may work with land owners or developers through the land use entitlement process to preserve agricultural lands by allowing a clustering of existing development rights onto a portion of a site so that a large portion of the site may be preserved for agricultural use. The city should allow such alternate methods of agricultural mitigation through planned development zoning and/or a development agreement so that it will result in equal or greater agricultural benefit than would result from standard mitigation requirements. At a minimum, mitigation shall still be required at a ratio of 1:1, but may allow flexibility with respect to timing and location. Also, an agricultural conservation easement shall be recorded over the agricultural mitigation lands subject to the planned development zoning and/or development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
Division III. - Residential Development Control System (RDCS)  
Chapter 18.156 - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTROL SYSTEM[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Note Sections which may be amended or repealed by the city council without voter approval are identified with the note "[CCA]" following the section heading. 
 
18.156.010 - RDCS purpose and history. 
A.  Purpose. This chapter establishes requirements for the Morgan Hill Residential Development Control System (RDCS). The purpose of the RDCS is to: 
1.  Establish a limit on the amount and rate of residential growth in Morgan Hill through 2035. 
2.  Encourage high quality residential development that enhances residents' quality of life. 
3.  Ensure that new residential development does not adversely impact the level of public services and infrastructure provided for current and future residents. 
4.  Promote a diverse stock of high quality housing to meet the full range of housing needs within Morgan Hill. 
5.  Encourage new residential development to contribute community benefits that enhance the public health, safety, and welfare. 
6.  Encourage an orderly, efficient, and sustainable residential development pattern. 
7.  Advance the goals and policies of the general plan and Downtown Specific Plan. 
8.  Provide certainty to residents that residential development patterns will reflect local goals and values. 
B.  History. The RDCS is a continuation and refinement of the voter-approved growth management system first established in Morgan Hill in 1977. The RDCS was originally approved by voters in response to concerns over the amount and pace of residential growth and the impacts of this growth on city services and infrastructure. RDCS ballot measures adopted by the voters include the following: 
1.  Measure E (1977), which set a target population of thirty thousand for year 2000 and established the RDCS. 
2.  Measure P (1990), which refined the RDCS and established a population ceiling of thirty-eight thousand eight hundred for 2010. 
3.  Measure C (2004), which again refined the RDCS and set the population ceiling to forty-eight thousand for 2020. 
4.  Measure F (2006) and Measure A (2009), which established exemptions for units constructed Downtown. 
5.  Measure S (2016), which was adopted in conjunction with the city's general plan update to further refine the RDCS and set the population ceiling to fifty-eight thousand two hundred for 2035. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.020 - Amendments to RDCS ordinance.

(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.030 - Transitional provisions. 
A.  Replacement of Prior RDCS Ordinance. This chapter repeals and replaces in its entirety the prior RDCS ordinances, previously codified in Division IV (Residential Development Code) of Title 18 (Zoning) of the Morgan Hill Municipal Code. 
B.  Prior Actions Remain Valid. Any city action taken or approval granted pursuant to the prior RDCS ordinance is not affected by the enactment of this chapter. All future actions and approvals shall comply with this chapter. 
C.  Previously Approved Allotments. 
1.  Allotments awarded and exercised prior to March 1, 2017, shall remain valid and are not affected by this chapter. 
2.  Allotments awarded prior to March 1, 2017, but which have not yet been exercised shall remain valid until the expiration date established at the time of allotment or as established in the project's development agreement. Applicant requests for an extension to the date by which these allotments must be exercised and city action on these requests are governed by Section 18.156.170 (Extensions) of this chapter. 
D.  No Changes to Prior Projects Required. No provision of this chapter shall require any change in the plans, construction, or design of the portion of a project which received allotments prior to March 1, 2017. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.040 - Population limit. 
A.  Maximum Population. Morgan Hill's population as of January 1, 2035 shall not exceed fifty-eight thousand two hundred. 
B.  Ceiling, Not a Target. The fifty-eight thousand two hundred population limit is a maximum ceiling, not a target. The city is not required to actively strive to reach fifty-eight thousand two hundred residents by 2035. Instead, the city shall ensure that Morgan Hill's population does not exceed this limit by 2035 while continuing to meet the full range of housing needs in Morgan Hill. 
C.  Limit to all Population Growth. Morgan Hill's population limit is intended to limit all population growth, including growth from new housing exempt from receiving RDCS allotments as specified in Section 18.156.050.C (Exemptions from Allotments) and set-aside allotments awarded as allowed by Section 18.156.070 (Downtown and Agricultural Preservation Set Asides). The number of allotments available each year and the process to adjust this number is intended to ensure that residential growth from all sources does not result in a population that exceeds the population limit of fifty-eight thousand two hundred residents in 2035. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.050 - AllotmentsGeneral. 
A.  Allotments Based on Population Limit. The city council shall establish a maximum number of residential allotments available each year, not to exceed two hundred fifteen allotments per year, such that the population in Morgan Hill does not exceed fifty-eight thousand two hundred as of January 1, 2035. 
B.  Allotment Requirement. A residential allotment authorizes an applicant to apply for land use entitlements and to construct these units should the city approve these entitlements. No residential unit may be developed without first obtaining an allotment, except for exempt units specified in Section C below. 
C.  Exemptions from Allotments. The following types of residential projects may be developed without first receiving any allotments: 
1.  One single-family home on a lot existing as of March 1, 2017; 
2.  Secondary dwelling units; 
3.  The conversion of an existing single-family home into a duplex provided that a new detached primary structure is not constructed on the lot or lots; 
4.  Assisted living/nursing homes; and 
5.  The annexation of existing dwelling units outside of city limits into the city. 
D.  Timing of Allotment Use. To maintain a steady rate of residential development, allotments must be used ("exercised") by a specific date as established in Section 18.156.160 (Expiration of Allotments). Allotments that are not used by the specified date expire and are no longer valid. Projects with expired allotments must reapply for allotments in the same manner as all other new proposed projects requesting allotments. 
E.  Rate of Growth. The planning commission shall allocate available allotments each year with the goal of maintaining a steady rate of growth. 
F.  Cancellation of Allotment Awards. The city council may cancel the process to award allotments upon finding that public services and facilities are inadequate to accommodate additional residential development and that awarding allotments would significantly impact the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.060 - Downtown and agricultural preservation set asides. 
A.  General. Through 2035 a certain number of allotments are set aside for residential projects in Downtown Morgan Hill and for projects that contribute to the city's agricultural preservation goals. 
B.  Eligibility. To be eligible to receive set-aside allotments, a project must receive at least eighty percent of the total maximum score in the RDCS competition criteria. 
C.  Competition Not Required. Eligible projects are not required to compete for set-aside allotments. Instead, allotments are issued to eligible projects by the planning commission on a first-come, first- served basis up to the total number of available set-aside allotments each year. 
D.  Number of Available Set-Aside Allotments. 
1.  Downtown Set-Asides. Through 2035, five hundred allotments are set aside for housing within the Downtown Specific Plan boundaries set forth in the city's general plan as of July 27, 2016. No more than one hundred set-aside allotments are available for downtown projects within a single year. 
2.  Agricultural Preservation Set-Asides. Through 2035, three hundred allotments are set-aside for housing that may be applied anywhere within the city. Recipient projects must directly establish permanent agricultural conservation easements within the city limits or within the city's priority agricultural conservation area. Easements must be established within the city's sphere of influence in a manner consistent with the citywide agricultural lands preservation program. The number of allotments granted to an eligible project shall be commensurate with the community benefit obtained from the resulting preservation of agricultural lands. No more than thirty-five set-aside allotments are available for agricultural preservation projects within a single year. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.070 - Urban service area boundaries. 
A.  Allotments within Urban Service Area Only. The city may approve allotments only for projects located within the city's urban service area boundaries. 
B.  Application to Expand Urban Service Area. The city may apply to the Santa Clara County Local Agency Formation Commission to expand the urban service area boundary of the city to accommodate additional residential development if the city council first makes all of the following findings supported by substantial evidence on the record of a duly noticed public hearing on the matter: 
1.  The expansion is necessary to accommodate the amount, rate, location, and type of residential development envisioned in the general plan. 
2.  The expansion is consistent with any city adopted plans, policies, or ordinances specifying a preferred sequence of future annexations. 
3.  Public services and infrastructure are or will be sufficient to accommodate development resulting from the expansion of the urban service area boundary. Additional development will not adversely impact public services and infrastructure, including public schools, the transportation system, parks, police, fire service, storm drainage, wastewater, and water service. 
4.  The expansion supports an orderly development pattern that prioritizes infill development adjacent to existing development and served by existing public services and infrastructure. 
5.  The expansion is necessary to accommodate the housing and/or employment needs of Morgan Hill. 
6.  The expansion promotes fiscal responsibility, cost-effective service delivery, and the city's ability to plan for and adequately maintain urban services over time. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.080 - Competition for allotments. 
A.  Annual Competition. Each year the city may conduct a competition for allotments for development of residential units, except when the city council cancels the competition allowed by Paragraph D below. Projects exempt from the RDCS competition as specified in Section 18.156.050.C (Exemptions from Allotments) and projects eligible for set-aside allotments as specified in Section 18.156.060 (Downtown and Agricultural Preservation Set Asides) do not participate in the competition. 
B.  Minimum Score. To be eligible to compete for allotments, a project must receive a minimum score of at least eighty percent of the total maximum score in the RDCS competition criteria. 
C.  Award of Allotments. The planning commission shall award allotments based on a scoring of projects using criteria established by the city council pursuant to Section 18.156.100 (Competition Manual). The planning commission may award a project fewer than the total number of allotments requested by the applicant. In such a case, the planning commission may award the surplus allotments to the next highest scoring projects if doing so would help create a more balanced and equitable distribution of allotments and help to achieve the goals of the general plan. 
D.  Cancellation of Allotment Awards. The city council may cancel the process to award allotments upon finding that public services and facilities are inadequate to accommodate additional residential development and that awarding allotments would significantly impact the public health, safety and welfare, or if there is insufficient demand necessary to produce high quality developments. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.090 - Competition categories. 
A.  General. Each year the city council may establish competition categories for certain types of projects. Projects within a competition category will compete for allotments only with other projects in the same competition category. For each competition category, the city council shall identify the number of allotments available for projects competing within the competition category. 
B.  Example Competition Categories. Example of competition categories may include, but are not limited to, projects within the Monterey Road corridor, small projects (less than fifteen units), senior housing, vertical mixed use, and multi-family rental. 
C.  Affordable Housing. When establishing competition categories, the city council shall ensure that an adequate number of allotments are available for affordable housing projects consistent with the city's regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) and adopted housing element. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.100 - Competition manual. 
The city council shall adopt and maintain an RDCS competition manual that establishes criteria and point values for the RDCS competition. The competition manual shall define terms and provide detail as needed to ensure that the city awards points consistently for all competing projects. 
A.  Competition Criteria. The competition manual shall identify the criteria that the city will use to award allotments to competing projects. Competition criteria in the competition manual shall advance the nine city objectives below, which may be modified only with voter approval. 
1.  Schools. Provide safe and convenient access to schools and ensure high quality schools in Morgan Hill. 
2.  Location. Encourage infill development adjacent to existing development and close to existing community services and facilities. 
3.  Affordable Housing. Increase the supply of housing affordable to households of all incomes levels. 
4.  Housing Diversity. Provide a variety of housing types and sizes to meet the range of housing needs within Morgan Hill. 
5.  Parks and Open Space. Provide high quality parks and recreational facilities and protect and preserve open space and productive agricultural land. 
6.  Environmental Protection. Increase energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy conservation, water conservation, habitat protection, and achieve other sustainability goals. 
7.  Transportation. Support a balanced and efficient transportation system for pedestrians, cyclists, public transit, and automobiles that maintains quality of life in residential neighborhoods. 
8.  Infrastructure and Services. Emphasize efficient use of public infrastructure and services. 
9.  Project Quality. Ensure quality design related to general livability, public safety, neighborhood form, site planning, building design, and landscape design. 
B.  Points. The Competition Manual shall establish points available for competition criteria that advance the city goals identified in Section A above. 
1.  Limitations on Number of Points and Changes. The total number of points for each of the nine objectives above (e.g., schools, location, affordable housing, etc.) shall be no more than twenty percent and no less than five percent of the total number of available RDCS competition points. The city council may adjust the number of points within each objective by no more than fifteen percent of the points available within the objective the previous year. 
2.  Intent of Points. Points shall be awarded only for projects that provide for excellence in project design and provide a community benefit that exceeds minimum requirements of the city and other governmental agencies. All projects must comply with city standards established in the general plan, municipal code, and other city rules and regulations together with other applicable laws. 
C.  Revisions to Criteria and Points. In order to promote long term consistency and reduce uncertainty for applicants for residential development, the city council shall amend competition criteria and point values in the competition manual only when necessary and no more frequently than once a year. The planning commission shall recommend to the city council any revisions to the competition criteria and/or point values. If amended, competition criteria and/or point values shall be established no later than six months prior to the RDCS application submittal deadline. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.110 - Number of available allotments. 
A.  Annual Allocations. Beginning with the competition in year 2017, the city may allocate no more than two hundred fifteen allotments in any given year for residential development that must compete for allotments. Set-aside allotments as described in Section 18.156.060 (Downtown and Agricultural Preservation Set-Asides) may be awarded in addition to the annual allotment maximum. 
B.  Annual Reductions to Available Allotments. Each year staff shall provide the planning commission with an assessment of conditions, per the findings below, that may necessitate a reduction in the number of available allotments. No later than six months prior to the RDCS application submittal deadline each year, the planning commission may recommend and the city council may reduce the number of available allotments for an RDCS competition year upon finding that: 
1.  Reducing the number of allotments is necessary to prevent a sudden spike in construction of new housing caused by a backlog of awarded allotments which have not yet been exercised. 
2.  Public infrastructure and services are or will be inadequate to accommodate the new development. Public infrastructure and services include public schools, the transportation system, parks, police, fire service, storm drainage, wastewater, and water service. 
3.  Other conditions are present that necessitate a reduction in the number of available allotments to achieve the RDCS purpose as stated in Section 18.156.010 (RDCS Purpose and History). 
4.  Downtown and/or agricultural preservation set-aside allotments have been issued. The number of annual allotments must be reduced to address the issuance of any set-aside allotments. 
5.  There is insufficient demand necessary to produce high quality developments or public benefits. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.120 - RDCS proceduresApplication submittal and review, project scoring, and award of allotments [CCA]. 
A.  Pre-Competition Orientation. The city shall hold an open pre-competition orientation meeting at least four months prior to the RDCS application submittal deadline. At this meeting the city shall review with prospective applicants the RDCS schedule, application requirements, and competition criteria for awarding points. 
B.  Pre-Application Review. To be eligible to submit an RDCS application, applicants must have completed pre-application review as described in Section 18.156.130 (Pre-Application Review). 
C.  Applications. Applicants shall submit an RDCS application consisting of the information and materials required by the city. Applications shall be submitted on a date determined by the community development director. Applications may not be modified after submittal except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. 
D.  General Plan and Zoning Consistency Determination. After deeming an RDCS application complete, the community development director or the director's designee shall evaluate each application for consistency with the city's general plan and zoning code and reject any applications which are found to be inconsistent with either the city's general plan or zoning code. The community development director's determination is appealable to the city council. The city council may direct the applicant to make modifications to the application and if these modifications bring the application into compliance with the general plan and zoning code the application may continue to compete for allotments. 
E.  Staff Scoring of Applications. After deeming an RDCS application complete and consistent with the general plan and zoning code, the community development director or director's designee shall recommend point assignments to projects using scoring criteria established by the city council. City staff shall forward recommended scoring to the planning commission. 
F.  Planning Commission Hearings  Project Scores. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the scoring recommendation and to make a final determination of project scoring. 
G.  Staff Recommendation  Award of Allotments. After the completion of the appeal period following the planning commission determination of project scoring, the community development director or the director's designee shall recommend the award of allotments based on the project scoring. City staff shall forward recommended award of allotments to the planning commission. 
H.  Planning Commission Hearings  Award of Allotments. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the award of allotment recommendation and to award allotments based on the project scoring. The planning commission may award fewer than the total number of allotments requested for a project and may award allotments to lower-scoring projects if doing so would create a more balanced and equitable distribution of allotments and help to achieve the goals of the general plan. 
I.  Appeals. All decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council pursuant to municipal code Chapter 18.64. 
J.  Development Agreement. The city may issue building permits only after the applicant has entered into a development agreement with the city confirming the specific development commitments made by the applicant at the time the planning commission awarded allotments. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.130 - Pre-application review [CCA]. 
A.  Pre-Application Review Requirement. Applicants may apply for allotments only after completing the pre-application review process. Pre-application review is required only once for a development project - projects which previously received allotments and reapply for additional allotments in subsequent competitions are not required to complete pre-application review again prior to reapplication. Significant changes to a project, as determined by the community development director, will require pre-application review. 
B.  Project Quality and Consistency. Pre-application review allows city staff to evaluate the overall project quality as well as consistency with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, the Morgan Hill Municipal Code, architectural review handbook, and other applicable city rules and regulations. Pre-application review is intended to help ensure that projects receiving allotments can be built consistent with their approved RDCS application. 
C.  Timing and Schedule. The community development director shall establish a schedule for submittal of materials and city staff review that provides sufficient time for the completion of pre-application review prior to the RDCS application submittal date. 
D.  Project Information Required. Applicants shall submit information and materials for pre- application review necessary to present the project concept and demonstrate compliance with city land use and neighborhood design policies in the general plan. Detailed architectural plans are not required. Materials submitted for pre-application review become part of the public record and are not confidential. 
E.  Multi-Department Review. The city planning division of the community development department, engineering division of the public works department, and other city staff involved in the land use entitlement approval process shall participate in the pre-application review. 
F.  Review Letter. After reviewing the submittal and meeting with the applicant, the community development director shall provide applicants with a pre-application review letter either making a preliminary finding that for the purposes of the RDCS competition the project is consistent with city policies and ordinances, or recommending changes to a project necessary to achieve consistency with those policies and regulations. The pre-application review letter is not a project approval or final determination by the city as to a project's conformity to city policies and ordinances. 
G.  Applicant Response. Applicants shall submit their pre-application review letter with their allotment application and any response, if needed, detailing the changes made to the project to address staff comments, or reasons why changes were not possible or desirable. 
H.  Planning Commission Consideration. The planning commission shall consider the pre-application review letter and the applicant's response to the letter when awarding competition points under the project quality criteria category. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.140 - Project phasing [CCA]. 
A.  Multi-Year Allotments. The planning commission may distribute allotments awarded to a single project over multiple years as allowed by this section. 
B.  Intent. Multi-year allotments are intended to support a fair and efficient RDCS process by allowing high quality projects constructed over multiple years to compete one time for allotments. 
C.  Eligibility. The planning commission shall have the discretion to determine which projects are eligible for multi-year allotments. 
D.  Number of Years. The planning commission may award allotments over a period of up to: 
1.  Three years for projects with less than one hundred units; and 
2.  Five years for projects with one hundred or more units. 
E.  Findings. The planning commission may award multi-year allotments to projects only upon finding that: 
1.  The multi-year allotments will support a steady rate of growth and help to avoid a sudden spike in construction of new housing; 
2.  The multi-year allotments will help the city to plan for adequate public services and infrastructure to accommodate new development; 
3.  The city will benefit from requiring the applicant to compete only once to receive allotments for all project phases; and 
4.  An adequate number of allotments will remain in future years to accommodate a range of housing types to meet Morgan Hill's housing needs. 
F.  Use of Allotments. 
1.  Multi-year allotments must be exercised by the date specified by the Planning Commission consistent with Section 18.156.160 (Expiration of Allotments). 
2.  If allotments for one year are not exercised by the specified expiration date, all multi-year allotments awarded to the project shall expire. 
G.  Regular Rate of Growth. Allotments awarded for future years shall be subtracted from the number of allotments available to other projects in those years so as to maintain a regular rate of growth consistent with the RDCS. 
(Ord. No. 2277 N.S., § 5(Exh. A), 6-6-2018)  
18.156.150 - Land use entitlements required [CCA]. 
A.  Authorization to Apply for Entitlements. An award of an allotment is not an entitlement to develop. Allotments authorize an applicant to apply for land use entitlements and to construct these units should the city approve the required land use entitlements.

B.  Expiration. Allotments that are not exercised consistent with the terms above expire the day following the exercise date specified in the development agreement.

E.  Public Notice and Hearing. The planning commission shall review and act on an extension request at a noticed public hearing. 
F.  Eligibility Criteria. 
1.  The planning commission may approve an extension only when the city or other public agency is responsible for a delay in the issuance of permits or granting approvals required to exercise the allotments, or due to an earthquake, flood, fire, or other severe act of nature outside of the applicant's control. It is the applicant's responsibility to provide evidence that the request is consistent with this requirement. 
2.  The planning commission may not approve an extension for any reason other than in Paragraph E.1 above, including but not limited to difficulties obtaining financing, changes to the project not required by the city or other public agencies, applicant delays responding to requests from the city or other public agency, personal circumstances of the applicant, or changes in property ownership. 
G.  Appeals. Planning commission denial of a requested extension may be appealed to the city council. The city council may grant the appeal only upon finding that the request complies with the eligibility criteria in Paragraph F above. 
H.  Effect of Denial. If a request for extension is denied, the allotments shall expire the day following the exercise date specified in the development agreement. Projects with expired allotments must reapply for allotments in the same manner as all other new proposed projects requesting allotments.
