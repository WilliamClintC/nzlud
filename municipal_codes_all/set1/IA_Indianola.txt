Thereafter, at least thirty days after such hearing the City Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning.

48.03 Residency Restriction
48.01 PURPOSE. This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in Indianola from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. As recognized by the Eighth Circuit United States Court of Appeals in its April 29, 2005, decision of Doe v. Miller, and as recognized by the Iowa Supreme Court in State v. Seering, decided on July 29, 2005, the City finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and day care centers. The City finds and declares that, in addition to schools and daycare centers, children congregate or play at child oriented facilities identified in Section 48.03(1).

In order to appeal such order, written notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within three (3) days after receipt of the order contained in the notice to remove dangerous animal.

1. The Indianola Police Department, in its discretion or upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a particular animal is a vicious animal as defined herein, may initiate proceedings to declare such animal a vicious animal.

Such notice shall set forth the description of the animal in question and the basis for the allegation of viciousness.

premises where the animal is located, or may be posted on those premises if no adult is present to accept service.
(Ord. 1388 – Feb. 08 Supp.)
2. If, after hearing, the Council determines that an animal is vicious, the Council shall order the person owning, sheltering, harboring, or keeping the animal to cause it to be destroyed in a humane manner. The order shall immediately be served upon the individual or entity against whom issued in the same manner as the notice of hearing. If the order is not complied with within three (3) days of its issuance, the Indianola Police Department is authorized to seize and impound the animal. An animal so seized shall be impounded for a period of seven (7) days. If at the end of the impoundment period, the individual or entity against whom the order of the Council was issued has not petitioned the Warren County District Court for a review of the order, the Indianola Police Department shall cause the animal to be destroyed.
(Ord. 1388 – Feb. 08 Supp.)
3. Any animal found at large which displays vicious tendencies may be processed as a vicious animal pursuant to the foregoing, unless the animal is so vicious that it cannot safely be apprehended, in which case the Indianola Police Department may immediately destroy it. If its ownership is not ascertainable, the Indianola Police Department may destroy it after three (3) days of impoundment.
4. Any animal which is alleged to be vicious and which is under impoundment or quarantine, shall not be released to the owner, but shall continue to be held at the expense of the owner pending the outcome of the hearing. All costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the owner if the animal is determined to be vicious. If the animal is not determined to be vicious, all costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the City.

CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 594 -
9. Conversion. Subscribers shall not be charged by Grantee for conversion from the existing Cable System to the upgraded Cable System.

10. Technical Standards. The Cable System permitted to be operated hereunder shall be operated in conformance with Chapter 112, this chapter, and FCC rules and regulations.

In the event the City enters into a Franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other person other than the Grantee to enter into the City’s public ways for the purpose of constructing or operating a Cable System or providing Cable Service to any part of the Service Area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not
CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 597 -
be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law.
111.16 FORCE MAJEURE. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the Franchise), where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, governmental administrative or judicial order or regulation or other event that is reasonably beyond the Grantee’s ability to anticipate and control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the Grantee’s cable and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.
111.17 ENFORCEMENT.
1. Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
2. Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in subsection 1 (a) to respond to the City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance, or (b) to cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
3. Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice described in subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days or the date projected pursuant to subsection 2 above, the City shall schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. The City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five business days in advance and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
4. Enforcement. In the event the City, after such public hearing, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the franchise, the City, subject to applicable Federal law, may:
CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 598 -
A. Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
B. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or
C. In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.
The City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of noncompliance by the Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have 30 days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a response satisfactory from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least five (5) days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such termination. At the designated meeting, the City shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the City “de novo” and to modify or reverse such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 120 days of the issuance of the determination of the City. The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
111.18 TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE. The City reserves the right to revoke the franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances:
1. If the Grantee should default in the performance of any of its material obligations under this chapter or Chapter 112 and fails to cure the default within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of the default from the City, or such longer time as specified by the City.
2. If a petition is filed by or against the Grantee under the Bankruptcy Act or any other insolvency or creditors’ rights law, State or Federal, and the Grantee shall fail to have it dismissed.
CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA

6. If the Grantee evades any of the provisions of this chapter or of Chapter 112 of this Code of Ordinances.
7. If the Grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the City or cable subscribers.
8. If the Grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for a franchise.
9. If the Grantee ceases to provide services over the cable system for seven (7) consecutive days for any reason within the control of the Grantee.
111.19 SECURITY FUND; LETTER OF CREDIT. In addition to any other right of enforcement provided in this Code of Ordinances, the Grantee shall establish the following security to ensure performance of the Grantee.
1. Amount. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date, Grantee shall establish and provide to the City an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit (LOC) as security for the faithful performance by Grantee of all of its obligations under this Agreement. The LOC shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
2. Use. The City may draw on the LOC to ensure the Grantee’s faithful performance of and compliance with this Agreement provided that Grantee has received prior written notice of determination of breach of this Agreement and thirty (30) days opportunity to cure, and further provided that if such draw is for the purpose of enforcing any liquidated damages obligations of this Agreement, all provisions of Section 111.17 of this chapter have been met and no stay has been granted. The City’s right to draw on the LOC hereunder may include, by way of example and not limitation, if Grantee fails to comply with any provisions of this Agreement which failure the City determines can be remedied by expenditure from the LOC. The City shall notify Grantee of the amount and date of withdrawal. Grantee’s recourse, in the event the City believes any draw upon the LOC is improper, shall be through legal
CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 600 -
action even after the LOC has been drawn upon. If the City’s action or taking is found to be improper by any court of competent jurisdiction, Grantee shall be entitled to a refund of any improperly withdrawn funds plus interest and/or any other specific performance which such court or agency shall order.
3. Restoration of Fund. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after City gives Grantee written notice that the LOC has been drawn upon, Grantee must take all steps required to restore the LOC to the original amount.
4. Return of Fund. Grantee’s obligation to maintain the LOC shall survive the termination of the Franchise, until all obligations to the City have been satisfied. However, if the franchise terminates for any reason, and the Grantee ceased to provide service in the City, and the City has determined that Grantee has fulfilled its obligations and is not in default, the Grantee’s obligations shall also terminate.
111.20 BONDING REQUIREMENTS. The Grantee shall provide a Corporate Guarantee in lieu of a bond executed by Heritage Investments, in the amount of $100,000 to secure the faithful performance by the Grantee of its obligations under the Franchise Agreement. This guarantee, however, shall not limit the liability of the Grantee for any failure to perform its obligations under this Franchise Agreement
111.21 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This chapter constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any and all previous agreements of whatever nature between the parties with respect to the subject matter. This chapter shall not be changed, amended, or supplemented except by an agreement in writing signed by both parties. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and Chapter 112 or any other enabling ordinance, law or regulation in effect at the time of this agreement or thereafter, the terms and conditions of this agreement shall be controlling, unless otherwise contrary to State or Federal law. The City may, from time to time, amend Chapter 112 pursuant to its lawful police powers; provided, however, such amendments shall not serve to impair the rights or increase the obligations of the Grantee pursuant to this chapter except if any said amendments are required by any Federal or State law.
111.22 NOTICES. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response required by this chapter to be served upon the City or the Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party five business days after having been posted in a properly sealed and correctly addressed envelope when hand delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid.

112.03 PURPOSE. The purpose of this chapter is to specify requirements for the establishment, construction, operation and maintenance of a cable system in the City pursuant to Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, and applicable Federal law.

For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and subscribers in the areas in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per lineal mile of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 20 potential subscribers.

CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 627 -
2. Ownership or Control. In the event that the Grantee sells or otherwise transfers ownership in the cable system, such sale or transfer shall conform with Section 617 of the Cable Act. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry.

the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the City, shall take control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the cable system for a period exceeding one (1) year, unless extended by the City at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and further subject to applicable Federal, State or local law, if the City finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.
4. Transfer. The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the Franchise Agreement. The City may approve the transfer or deny the transfer pursuant to Section 617 of the Cable Act.

112.42 TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE. The City shall have the right to compel the Grantee to test, analyze, and report on the performance of the cable system. The City may also perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business days, and providing a representative of the Grantee has an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee.

The principal means for accomplishing this flexibility will be the scheduled review sessions provided for in this chapter. It is intended that such review sessions will serve as a means of cooperatively working out solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such review sessions shall be two-way processes. For example, if either party has perceived that some major problem has developed, the session shall be devoted primarily to working out solutions acceptable to both parties.

give notice of such emergency disruption, but nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to create a duty to such notice. Restoration of right-of-way facilities that have been cut or moved as aforesaid shall be done by the right-of-way user at its own expense.
134.13 COORDINATION OF INSTALLATIONS. All right-of-way users with facilities in the City right-of-way or who expect to install facilities in the City right-of-way shall coordinate such activities with the City and with each other right-of-way user.
134.14 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
1. A right-of-way user that has or expects to install facilities within the City right-of-way shall maintain in effect such insurance appropriate to the nature of the facilities installed or to be installed, and the location of such installations. Except the City of Indianola, it's utilities, and franchised utilities, which are covered under other ordinances.
2. The Building and Zoning Official may require performance security in an amount commensurate with the scope of the work, to secure satisfactory installation in accordance with the installation permit, by means of an irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the City Attorney, or by cash deposit.
134.15 POLE ATTACHMENTS.
1. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a right-of-way user to attach its facilities to the poles of the City of Indianola municipal electric utility, or to the utility poles of any other right-of-way user. Installation of right-of-way user facilities underground in the same places where other right-of-way user facilities are attached to an existing set of utility poles shall be permitted.

3. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the City of Indianola municipal electric utility from requiring any right-of-way user to make a payment of a pole attachment fee and "make ready" charges for attachment of facilities to the utility poles of the City of Indianola municipal electric utility; and, to enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of a pole attachment agreement.
CHAPTER 134 USE OF CITY RIGHT-OF-WAY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 749 -
4. At those locations on the City right-of-way where there are already existing utility poles of either the City of Indianola municipal electric utility or of some other right-of-way user, a second set of permanent poles is strictly prohibited, except when done by or at the request of the City. If there is not sufficient space on the existing utility poles for attachment of the proposed additional right-of-way user facilities, or if the right-of-way user proposing to install right-of-way user facilities at the site of the existing poles cannot reach an agreement with the owner of the poles to allow attachment of those facilities, then those facilities shall be installed underground.
134.16 APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL. A right-of-way user that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way installation permit, that has its right-of-way installation permit revoked, or that believes that the fees imposed do not conform to the requirements of Chapter 480A, Code of Iowa, may request in writing that such denial, revocation or fee imposition be reviewed by the City Council. The City Council shall act within sixty (60) days of a timely written request. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must be in writing and supported by a written finding establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
134.17 NO EASEMENT, PERMISSION ONLY, NOT ASSIGNABLE. The provisions of this chapter, and the permits and authorizations granted pursuant to this chapter, shall not be deemed to create or grant to anyone any easement, estate, or interest in the property of the City. A permit to install right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way is a mere license, that is, an authorization to the stated entity to go onto the land of the City to do only that which is explicitly stated by the permit, that may be revoked by the City as provided in this chapter, and that cannot be assigned to another. A right-of-way user that occupies City right-of-way or makes an installation of facilities in the City right-of-way on the basis of a purported assignment of an installation permit granted to another entity, shall be in violation of this section.

All legal or equitable defenses are available to the abutting property owner in an action brought pursuant to this section.

The agreement shall be verified and placed on record in the office of the Warren County Recorder, and shall be a covenant running with the land binding the heirs and assigns of the property owner.
5. When the strict application of standards or requirements established by this section would cause substantial hardship or impose unreasonable restrictions regarding the installation of a sidewalk because of natural or physical conditions or limitations not created by the owner or developer, the Council may grant such waivers and/or variances from these standards or requirements as may be necessary pursuant to the following procedure. At such time when the conditions or limitations are eliminated, the owner or developer will be required to install such sidewalk within one hundred twenty (120) days after notification by the City.
A. The applicant under this subsection shall prepare an application to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review of the required sidewalk. The applicant may request a waiver of the sidewalk requirement or a variance of the sidewalk requirement. Within forty-five (45) days after receiving the application, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend to the Council to either approve, approve subject to conditions, or disapprove the request. Failure by the Commission to act within forty-five (45) days shall be deemed a recommendation for approval of the request.
B. The Council shall establish criteria and specific design standards to assist it and the Planning and Zoning Commission when considering applications for waivers and/or variances. All such criteria and specific design standards shall be established in such a way as to ensure the orderly and harmonious development of a City-wide sidewalk system in such a manner as will safeguard the public’s health, safety and general welfare.
C. Upon recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission to the Council, the applicant’s request will be put on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled Council meeting for final approval or disapproval by the Council. If the Council rejects the request, the Council will advise the applicant of any changes which are desired or that should have consideration before approval will be given. The applicant shall then submit the revised original for certification by the Council. The Commission

D. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.

STATEMENT OF INTENT
It is the intent of this district to permit innovative design concepts to be used in residential development where a deviation from conventional layout and development practices would result in a more appropriate use of land and subsequently promote the general health, welfare, safety and morals of future residents of the area.
It is not the intent of this classification to permit an unrelated mixture of uses to be developed, but to permit the establishment of unified developments with uses arranged in a manner compatible with one another, the site to be developed and the surrounding area.
It is further the intent of this district that such development adhere to recognized principles of civic design, land use planning and landscape architecture.

Only commercial uses listed in the R-5 classification may be permitted as a part of a planned residence district. Such commercial uses shall serve primarily as supporting facilities to the residential use of the proposed development. Commercial uses shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total area of the development.
3. Yards, Area and Height. Variations in yard requirements, lot area and height required in the R-3 district may be approved for the planned residence district; however, the minimum wards around the boundaries of the R-5 district shall not be less than required in the R-3 district.
4. Density. The total number of dwelling units within the planned residence district shall not exceed the average net density that would be permitted in the R-3 district for the type or types of dwellings proposed. Density shall be computed on a total area basis using private streets and drives, common open space, park areas, recreation areas, off-street parking areas, as well as building site areas, but shall not include areas occupied or used for commercial purposes or related uses.
5. Open Space. Planned residence districts shall take into consideration the need for open space and recreation areas to enhance the general character of the area. In the event open space land or recreation areas are to be retained under private ownership, the owner shall submit a legally binding instrument setting forth the procedures and responsibilities for maintaining said areas including the means for financing maintenance costs.

STATEMENT OF INTENT
The C-4 Planned Commercial District is intended to allow potential developers flexibility in development of particular tracts of land without compromising existing uses and structures by submitting a comprehensive plan of one (1) acre or more with the change of zoning application. Once this plan is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council, it cannot be changed except as provided herein.

For the purpose of not allowing what may be considered an objectionable use, the permitted principal use approved by the Council after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance may not be changed to another use in another class without Council approval. Exception: Class One permitted principal uses are allowed within Class Two.

Where the strict application of the standards or requirements established by this chapter would cause substantial hardship or impose unreasonable restrictions on development of a tract of land because of natural or physical conditions or limitations not created by the owner or developer, the Commission may recommend and the Council may grant such changes and modifications from these standards or requirements as may be necessary to permit the reasonable development of the land while preserving the intent of this chapter. These changes and modifications may include the following:
1. Minimum floor area.
2. Maximum height.
3. Required off-street parking.

165.10 SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS. Subject to Section 165.09, the following provisions, regulations, or exceptions may apply equally to all districts except as hereinafter provided:
1. Visibility at Intersection. On a corner lot in any district, except the C-3 General Retail and Office District, no fence, wall, hedge, or other planting or structure that will obstruct vision between a height of two (2) feet and ten (10) feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by connecting the right-of-way lines at points which are twenty-five (25) feet distant from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, and measured along the right-of-way lines. For purposes of this section, a split rail fence, chain link fence, or any other fence which consists of vision blocking material over twenty-five percent (25%) or less of its total surface area is not considered as obstructing vision.
2. Accessory Buildings. No accessory building shall be erected in any required front or side yard and no separate accessory building shall be erected within five (5) feet of any main buildings or any property line. No separate accessory building shall occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of the required rear yard or exceed twelve (12) feet in height.
3. More than One Principal Structure on a Lot. In any district, more than one (1) principal structure housing a permitted principal use shall be erected on a single lot provided that the area, yard and other requirements of this chapter are met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot.
4. Height Regulation Exception. The height limitations contained in the schedules of district regulations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, chimneys, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, elevator housing, or other structures placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy.
5. Use of public Right-of-way. No portion of the public road, street or alley right-of-way shall be used or occupied by an abutting use of land or structure for storage or display purposes or to provide any parking or loading space required by this chapter, or for any other purpose that would obstruct the use or maintenance of the public right-of-way. Provided, however, tables, chairs and displays associated with the adjoining business shall be allowed in the C-3 zoning (Central Business District) subject to the following:
A. Permitted on all sidewalks provided there remains a free walking path with a minimum walking surface of five feet (5’) in width.
B. Allowed during business hours only.
C. Provide proof of public liability insurance for such sign in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).
(Ord. 1587 – May 18 Supp.)
6. Proposed Use not Covered in Chapter. Any proposed use not covered in this chapter as a permitted use or special exception shall be referred to the
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1050 -
Commission for a recommendation as to the proper district in which such use should be permitted and the chapter amended as provided in Section 165.38 before a permit is issued for such proposed use.
7. Buildings to Have Frontage. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered, shall be on a lot or parcel having a frontage on a public street or road.
8. Mobile Homes. Mobile homes occupied as a permanent or temporary place of residence shall be limited to private property for a maximum of 30 days per calendar year after which time located only in an approved mobile home park or mobile home subdivision unless otherwise provided in this chapter.

9. Hedges and Fences. Fences or hedges in residential districts shall not exceed four (4) feet in height in any required front yard and fences shall not exceed six (6) feet in height in any required side or rear yard, subject to the further restriction of subsection 1 above. Fences shall be built wholly on the owner’s property unless it is otherwise agreed with the owner of the adjacent property, and hedges shall not be planted closer than two and one-half (2½) feet to any property line. All outdoor swimming pools shall be fenced to prevent unauthorized access by small children and to provide a degree of security. Such fence shall be an “unclimbable fence,” which means a solid wall, chain-link fence, or other fence of sufficient strength and durability and design to render such pool inaccessible to children. In the case of in-ground pools, this shall be accomplished using a fence or wall not less than six (6) feet in height, located not less than five (5) feet from each side of such pool. In the case of above-ground pools, a combination of fence or wall and the water-enclosing wall of the swimming pool may be used, providing that the pool is reasonably secure and the effective enclosure height is not less than six (6) feet. For all swimming pools, any opening to the swimming pool shall be equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device with locking provisions for keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when not in actual use. This section is applicable to pools in excess of five thousand (5,000) gallons.
10. Floodplain Construction. No building shall be located in a floodplain or waterway within the City if, after due consideration has been given to (i) the reasonable anticipated volume of water delivery to the proposed site, (ii) modifications made to provide for the disposal of excess water, and (iii) the type of structure to be erected, the Zoning Administrative Officer determines that special and unnecessary risks and hazards to the proposed structure would exist.
11. Satellite Receiving Antenna.
A. No person shall place, erect, construct, or install any satellite dish without first obtaining a building permit.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1051 -
B. Any satellite receiving antenna hereafter constructed in a residential zoning district shall be mounted on the ground at a height no greater than the peak of the roof of the residence located on the lot on which the antenna is to be located. If there is no residence on the lot in which the antenna is to be located, the height shall be controlled by the residence on the lot nearest to the lot on which the antenna will be located. In no event shall the height be greater than fifteen (15) feet. The height of the antenna shall be measured vertically from the highest point of the signal receiving apparatus, when positioned for operation, to the bottom of the base which supports the antenna.
C. No satellite receiving antenna shall be mounted, located or placed permanently or temporarily in any residential zoning districts in any front yard and the portion of the side yard that is adjacent to the principal structure on the lot, and not within five (5) feet of the lot lines in the remaining side yard and rear yards.
D. No satellite receiving antenna in residential districts shall be greater than twelve (12) feet in diameter.
E. Satellite receiving antennas mounted on trailers or vehicles may be allowed for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) days. All others shall be permanently placed.

However, the top of the building mounted antenna shall not be higher than the peak of the roof of such building, and the antenna shall not be located on the side or front of the residence.
12. Parking regulations.
A. For use in this subsection, the following definitions are given:
(1) “Front yard” means a yard extending across the full width of the lot and measured between the front lot line and the building or any projection thereof, and on corner lots the front yard shall be considered the yard adjacent to the street upon which the lot has its least dimension.
(2) “Vehicle” includes, but is not limited to, motorized vehicle, travel trailer, camping trailer and boat.
B. No person shall park, store or permit the parking or storage of any vehicle in the front yard of a one- or two-family dwelling for more than forty-eight (48) consecutive hours except on a driveway.
C. No person shall park, store or permit the parking or storage of more than four (4) vehicles in the combined side and rear yards of a
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1052 -
one- or two-family dwelling unless such parking or storage is on a driveway or in an enclosed building or garage.
D. No one- or two-family dwelling with a one- or two-car garage shall have more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the front yard used for driveway parking purposes. However, this restriction shall not prohibit the construction of a twenty (20) foot wide driveway. One- and two-family dwellings that have a three (3) or more car garage shall be subject to the discretion of the Director of Community Development.
(Ord. 1552 – May 16 Supp.)
13. Outdoor Storage of Race Cars.
A. For purposes of this subsection “race car” means stock car, race car, race truck, figure eight car, demolition derby car, drag race car, off-road race car or sprint car. In any residential or agricultural zoning district it is unlawful for any person to store outside, accumulate outside or allow to remain outside any race car, whether on or off a trailer, on any private property within the corporate limits of the City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, race cars are allowed to be parked outside on private property for a period of no more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours.
B. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to one, two, three or four operable race cars which can be moved under their own power if they are in a rear yard as defined by Section 165.03(53) or if they are in a side yard as defined by Section 165.03(54) and they are completely covered by a factory designed and manufactured fitted car cover. In no event shall the number of covered race cars and other vehicles permitted by Section 165.10(12)(C) exceed a total of four in the combined side and rear yards.
C. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to one operable race car which can be moved under its own power if it is parked in a front yard as defined by Section 165.03(52) and it is completely covered by a factory designed and manufactured fitted car cover as long as the race car is parked on a driveway.

15. Temporary or Seasonal Structures. These regulations are intended to prescribe the conditions under which a limited duration of agricultural and commercial activities (e.g. garden centers, drink and food vendors, tents and storage structures) may exist. The intent of this subsection is to allow the display and marketing of merchandise and seasonal structures in an attractive manner to serve the desires of the general public, but prevent creation of any
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS

- 1053 -
nuisance or annoyance to the occupants of adjacent buildings, premises, or property and the general public. The following structures are qualified for a temporary installation, provided they meet the associated criteria.

165.11 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS. Subject to Section 165.09, the regulations and restrictions of this chapter shall apply as follows:
1. Regulations to be Uniformly Applied. The regulations set by this chapter shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and particularly within each district, except as hereinafter provided.
2. All Uses and Structures to Conform. No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.
3. Height, Density or Yards Shall not be Violated. No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed the height, to accommodate or house a greater number of families, or to have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or other open spaces, than herein required or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this chapter.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1054 -
4. Separate Yards, Open Space and Off-street Parking Required. No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter shall be included as part of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building.
5. Minimum Yards and Lot Areas May not be Reduced. No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the Zoning Ordinance shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter.
6. New Areas Annexed to City. All territory which may hereafter become a part of the incorporated area of the City shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to annexation for the most appropriate use. The proposed zoning classification may be determined by reviewing the existing uses of the land provided such uses are listed as a permitted principal use within the zoning ordinance. The future land use map within the current comprehensive plan should be used for land that is undeveloped as well as the availability of public water and sanitary sewer services. The Commission may recommend the appropriate zoning district classification prior to such territory becoming a part of the City and upon the holding of a public hearing and approval by the Council, the territory, upon becoming part of the City, may be immediately so classified. (Ord. 1272 – Feb. 04 Supp.)
7. Parking Spaces. No parking space required by this chapter shall be provided in any required front yard in a residential district and no required parking space, driveway, or any merchandise display or exterior storage shall be provided in any required front yard or in the first five (5) feet inside the property line of any required side or rear yard in a C-2 district.

8. Off-street Parking. All off-street parking for new one- and two-family dwellings shall conform with Section 166.04(2)(F) of this Code of Ordinances.
9. Vegetation. All new one- and two-family dwellings are required to plant and maintain four (4) shrubs and two (2) trees. Also, all disturbed areas of the lot must either be sodded or seeded prior to occupancy of the residence. If seeding is chosen, a seedbed with a minimum of 80% perennial grass is required. The entire lot must have an established lawn and be 95% weed free within ninety (90) days of occupancy of the dwelling. When seeding adjacent to any previously established lawn, soil erosion controls identified in the Statewide Urban Design and Specification (SUDAS) shall be required. The seeding requirement does not replace any recorded covenant mandating sod.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1055 -
The Director of Community Development may temporarily waive the sod or seed requirements if improper weather conditions exist at the time of occupancy.
(Ord. 1442 – Jan. 10 Supp.)
165.12 NONCONFORMING USES. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before the Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. Subject to Section 165.09, it is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
165.13 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted the single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected as a variance on a single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding that such fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district where it is located. Yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located. Such variance of area or width shall be permitted only after approval by the Board of Adjustment.
165.14 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1056 -
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
3. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located.
165.15 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
2. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
165.16 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES. If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
2. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
3. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1057 -
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
4. Any structure or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
5. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, the structure, thereafter, shall not be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
6. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
165.17 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current replacement value of the building provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
165.18 USES UNDER EXCEPTION PROVISIONS. Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.
165.19 NONCONFORMING USES TO REGISTER. The owner or operator of any use of land or use of a structure or use of land and structure in combination, which shall become nonconforming on the effective date of this chapter shall complete and file with the Administrative Officer a nonconforming use registration form, describing the use, the nature of its nonconformity, and the area of land or structure occupied on said date.
165.20 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT. An Administrative Officer designated by the Council shall administer and enforce this chapter. Said officer may be provided with the assistance of such other persons as the Council
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1058 -
may direct. If the Administrative Officer finds that any of the provisions of this chapter are being violated, said officer shall notify in writing the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Administrative Officer shall order discontinuance of illegal buildings or structures or of additions, alterations, or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this chapter to insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.
165.21 APPEALS FROM DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. Appeals from any decision of the Administrative Officer may be taken to the Board of Adjustment as provided in section 165.32.
165.22 INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS.

Wherever the requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions, or covenants, the most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall govern.
165.23 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES. Any person who violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be subject to the standard penalty for violation of this Code of Ordinances and shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the prosecution of the violation. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
165.24 SEPARATE OFFENSES MAY BE CHARGED. The owners or tenants of any building, structure, land or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains a violation may each be charged with a separate offense and upon conviction suffer the penalties herein provided.
165.25 INJUNCTION; MANDAMUS. If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired or land is used in violation of this chapter, the City may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate, lawful action necessary to prevent, correct, or abate such violation.
165.26 CONSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE. Subsequent to the adoption of this chapter a construction compliance certificate shall be obtained from the Administrative Officer before any building or structure shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered to increase the exterior dimensions, height, or floor area, or remodeled to increase the exterior dimensions, height, or floor area, or remodeled to increase the number of dwelling units or accommodate a change in
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1059 -
use of the building and/or premises or part thereof. The construction compliance certificate shall state that the proposed construction complies with all provisions of this chapter, and no subsequent modifications shall be made to plans or to actual construction that would be in violation of this chapter. A construction compliance certificate issued under this section shall lapse six (6) months from the date of its issuance unless construction has begun within that period and shall also lapse if construction is stopped after it is initiated for a period of time in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days. In the event that a construction compliance certificate lapses for either of the above reasons, a new certificate shall be required before construction can resume. This amendment shall apply to all outstanding building permits at the time of its adoption so that if construction is not commenced within six (6) months after the date of this amendment, the rights under the building permit shall lapse.
165.27 MULTIPLE-DWELLING CONSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES. Requests for construction of multiple-dwelling compliance certificates shall be examined by the Fire Chief or the designee of the Fire Chief, who shall make a recommendation for approval or disapproval to the Zoning Administrator who shall finally either approve or disapprove the request.
165.28 OCCUPANCY COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE. Subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, no change in the use or occupancy of land nor any change in use or occupancy in an existing building, other than for single-family dwelling purposes, shall be made, nor shall any new building be occupied for any purpose other than a single-family dwelling until an occupancy compliance certificate has been issued by the Administrative Officer. Every occupancy compliance certificate shall state that the new occupancy complies with all provisions of this chapter and no subsequent modifications shall be made to the occupancy, use, or method of operation that would be in violation of this chapter. No single-, two-, or multiple-family dwelling or other structure designed for human use or occupancy shall be occupied nor shall any occupancy compliance certificate be issued for any of the foregoing until and unless all improvements and installations required by the subdivision regulation ordinance of the City of Indianola (Chapter 170) have been made and accepted by the City.
165.29 APPLICATION FOR COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES. Applications for compliance certificates shall be made prior to beginning construction or assuming occupancy on fully completed application forms obtained from the Administrative Officer, accompanied by such plans and information necessary to determine that the proposed construction or occupancy complies with all applicable provisions of this chapter.

CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1060 -
provisions contained herein and to charge a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each construction compliance certificate or occupancy compliance certificate issued separately.

(Ord. 1262 – Aug. 03 Supp.)
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1061 -
165.34 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Administrative Officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal is filed with said officer, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in such officer’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Administrative Officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
165.35 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. The Board of Adjustment has the following powers and duties:
1. Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrative Officer in the enforcement of this chapter.
2. Special Exceptions;. Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. To hear and decide only such special exceptions as the Board of Adjustment is specially authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter and to deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
A. A written application for a special exception is submitted indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
B. Notice shall be given at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
C. The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by agent or attorney.
D. The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the special exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect the public interest. In granting any special exception, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable under Section 165.23 of this chapter. The Board of Adjustment shall
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1062 -
prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit set shall void the special exception.
3. Variances: Conditions Governing Application; Procedures. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
A. A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
(1) That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
(2) That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter;
(3) That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant;
(4) That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
B. Notice of public hearing shall be given as in subsection 2(B) above.
C. The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by agent or by attorney.
D. The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements of paragraph A of this subsection have been met by the applicant for a variance.
E. The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1063 -
variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
F. The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable under Section 165.23 of this chapter. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.
165.36 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three (3) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Administrative Officer, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in application of this chapter.
165.37 APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the City aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State and particularly by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
165.38 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS. The regulations imposed in the districts created by this chapter may be amended from time to time by the Council, but no such amendment shall be made without public hearing before the Council and after a report has been made upon the amendment by the Commission. At least fifteen (15) days’ notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. The Commission shall not make any recommendation to the Council until a sign eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches indicating the zoning change requested has been prepared and posted by the City in a visible location on the premises for a period of fifteen (15) days. In case the Commission does not approve the change or, in the case of a
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
- 1064 -
protest filed with the Council against a change in district boundaries signed by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change or of those immediately adjacent thereto and within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries thereof, such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all the members of the Council.
165.39 APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. Any person may submit to the Council an application requesting a change in the zoning district boundaries as shown on the official zoning district map.

1. The legal description and local address of the property.
2. The present zoning classification and the zoning classification requested for the property.
3. The existing use and proposed use of the property.

6. A plat showing the locations, dimensions and use of the applicant’s property and all property within two hundred (200) feet thereof, including streets, alleys, railroads, and other physical features.
7. If the requested zoning change is from A-1 (Agricultural) to any other classification, the application shall contain the number of acres in each soil type for which a rezoning change is requested and the crop suitability rating of each. The soil type and its crop suitability rating shall be determined by the latest cooperative soil survey and accompanying data.
8. Prior to rezoning any property the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council shall consider the following relative to orderly regulated development: adequate size and location of public sanitary sewer, adequate size and location of public water and the presence of existing hard surfaced streets. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to mean the City has any regulatory power for property used for agricultural purposes outside the City limits.
(Ord. 1431 – Sep. 09 Supp.)
All fees shall be deposited to the General Revenue Fund of the City. Failure to approve the requested change shall not be deemed cause to refund the fee to the applicant.

166.11 HIGHWAY CORRIDORS.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the architectural design standards found in this section is to recognize the importance of Highways 65-69 and 92 to the City’s image and future development, to establish specific design guidelines for all development within the enforcement areas and to avoid the construction of structures which have the general appearance of farm machine sheds. Improvement of the highway corridors through Indianola should be undertaken by devising an overall long range plan. The plan must focus on unifying and enhancing the appearance not only of the public right-of-way but also of the private property abutting it.
2. Enforcement Area. All improvements and/or developments that are subject to the requirements of this chapter and are property zoned C-2 (Highway Commercial), A-1 (Agricultural), R-1 (Single-Family Residential), R-2 (Single and Two-Family Residential, R-3 (Mixed Residential) and M-2 (General Industrial). (Ord. 1441 – Jan. 10 Supp.)
3. Design Standards.
A. A minimum of one hundred percent (100%) of the building wall surface that faces Highway 65-69 or 92 shall consist of full

USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
1. OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
2. DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such as the City Library, County Law Library and perhaps the schools.
3. SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in outdated codes being used or misused.
4. RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances was No. 163, we would suggest that the first ordinance passed changing, adding to or deleting from the Code be assigned the number 164; the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the numbering of ordinances.
CODE OF ORDINANCES APPENDIX
CODE OF ORDINANCES, INDIANOLA, IOWA
APPENDIX - 2
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances, and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic, and chapter number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts. Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.2)
The following forms of ordinances are recommended for making amendments to the Code of Ordinances:
