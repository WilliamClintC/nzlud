The employee organization may meet with the city manager on behalf of an employee group regarding issues such as wages, hours, benefits (excluding health care) and other such items mutually agreed upon by the employee organization and the city manager. An employee organization may not elect to engage in the "Meet and Confer" process until that group has participated in the "Meet and Discuss" process for a minimum of twelve (12) months following certification.

(6)  Any person violating any part of this subsection 4.5-2 shall also be subject to any fees required in this chapter as though such violator were a licensee. 
(c)  Authorization to engage in business. Any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall authorize and permit the licensee to engage in the business of operating and providing a cable system in the city, and for that purpose to erect, install, solicit, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any public way, such poles, wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduit, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, attachments and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the cable system; and in addition, so to use, operate, and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons, firms or corporations, including but not limited to any public utility or other licensee licensed or permitted to do business in the city. 
(d)  Limitations of license. 
(1)  Any license granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive. 
(2)  Any privilege claimed under any license by the licensee in any public way or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior or subsequent lawful occupancy or use thereof by the city or any other governmental entity, and shall be subordinate to any prior easements therein; provided, however, that nothing shall extinguish or otherwise interfere with property rights established independently of any license issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  Any right or power in, or duty imposed upon, any officer, employee, department or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by the city to any other officer, employee, department or board of the city. 
(4)  A licensee shall be subject to all requirements of city's rules, regulations and specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or established and shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations heretofore enacted or established. There is hereby reserved to the city the power to amend any section of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation, maintenance or otherwise pursuant to the city's lawful police powers or as provided in the license. 
(5)  Any license granted shall not relieve the licensee of any obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any department of the city, utility company or from others lawfully maintaining poles in public ways. 
(e)  Acquisition by city. 
(1)  In accordance with Section 627 of the Cable Act, if a renewal of a license held by a licensee is denied and the city acquires ownership of the cable system or effects a transfer of ownership of a cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the license itself. The fair market value of the cable system shall be determined by an appraisal committee consisting of three (3) appraisers nationally recognized by training and experience as qualified to appraise the fair market value of a large, urban cable system. No appraiser shall have previously acted in any capacity for either the city or licensee. The appraisal committee shall function as an arbitration panel and shall conduct its appraisal process in Maricopa County, in accordance with the Center For Public Resources rules for non-administered arbitration of business disputes (the "rules"), supplemented by the following procedures which shall control to the extent they conflict with the rules: 
a.  Each party shall appoint an appraiser within thirty (30) days after the city sends notice initiating appraisal proceedings. The two (2) appraisers shall select a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after selection of the second appraiser. If the two (2) appraisers are unable to agree on the appointment of a third appraiser within such thirty-day period, either the city or the licensee may petition the presiding civil judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, acting in his or her individual capacity, for the selection of a third appraiser. 
b.  Each party shall bear the cost of its own appraiser and one-half (1/2) of the cost of appointing the third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee, and of any reasonable expenses incurred by the appraisers in order to carry out the appraisal process. 
c.  Within thirty (30) days after selection of the third appraiser, the appraisers shall meet for the purpose of determining the manner in which the parties may present by evidence that may bear upon the appraisal. Within ninety (90) days after such meeting, the appraiser shall receive and consider such evidence and enter an award determining the fair market value of the cable system consistent with the requirements of this subsection 4.5-2(e). Such award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
(2)  If a license held by a licensee is revoked for cause and the city acquires ownership of the cable system or effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price. Under the term "equitable price," such matters as the harm to the community resulting from the licensee's breach of the license may be considered in determining the appropriate price. No payment shall be made by the city to the licensee that would include a value attributed to the license itself. 
(3)  Upon the termination of a license and the rights granted thereunder, whether by expiration or forfeiture, the city council may direct and require the licensee as provided in subsection 4.5-5(c) to remove its wires, cables, fixtures, and accessories and appurtenances from the pubic ways. If directed, the city shall make a claim on the letter of credit as prescribed in subsection 4.5-7(d). 
(f)  Rights reserved to the city. 
(1)  Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the city to acquire the property of the licensee, by purchase, at fair market value, which shall not include any amount for the license itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the city's right of eminent domain. 
(2)  There is hereby reserved to the city every right and power that is required to be herein reserved or provided by any provision of the City Charter or City Code, and a licensee shall comply with any action or requirements of the city in its exercise of such rights or power heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
(3)  Neither the granting of any license hereunder nor any of the provisions contained herein shall be construed to prevent the city from granting any identical, or similar, license to any other person, firm, or corporation, within the city. 
(4)  Neither the granting of any license nor the enactment of any provision in this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the city, now existing or hereafter granted. 
(5)  The city council may do all things that are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may, through the city manager or through its own action, adjust, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve, pursuant to subsection 4.5-7(g) and (h), any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any licensee under this chapter. 
(g)  Initial license; applications. 
(1)  Each application for an initial license to construct, operate or maintain any cable system in the city shall be filed with the office of the city clerk in the form of a proposal for initial license as prescribed by the city. Said forms shall require, but shall not be limited to, the following information:

(h)  Fees; application of initial license. 
(1)  Amount. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter, each applicant for an initial license must furnish with its proposal a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount established by the council, by cash, certified or cashier's check, wire transfer or in any other manner acceptable to the city manager, made payable to the City of Avondale. No proposal for an initial license shall be considered without receipt of said fee. 
(2)  Deposit and use. All fees received will be deposited to an account of the city and will serve to recover expenses incurred by the city in the preparation and granting of initial licenses and regulation of licenses pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  Additional fee. Any licensee under an initial license, upon acceptance of such initial license, shall reimburse all additional expenses, including, but not limited to, any and all administrative, engineering, publication or legal costs and consultants' expenses incurred in connection with the processing, evaluation and preparation of documents relating to the initial license. The city shall document all such expenses by invoice. If expenses exceed the total amount of filing fees collected from the applicant(s), the licensee shall pay to the city the excess amount within thirty days of demand of the city. All unpaid amounts at the end of thirty (30) days shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half (11/2) percent per month. 
(i)  Selection of licensee; initial license. 
(1)  Solicitation of proposals. The city may, by advertisement or any other means, solicit and call for proposals for initial license, and may determine and fix any time period during which proposals will be received by the city and may make any other determinations and specify any other times, terms, conditions or limitations respecting the soliciting, calling for, making and receiving of such proposals. 
(2)  Unsolicited proposals. The city, upon receipt of an unsolicited proposal for initial license may, by advertising or other means, solicit and call for competing proposals pursuant to subsection (1) above, or may, in its sole discretion, reject such proposal as untimely. 
(3)  Compliance with city requirements. A person, firm or corporation submitting a proposal for initial license to operate a cable system in response to the city's request for proposals shall provide all information required by this chapter and all other information requested by city's request for proposals or otherwise required by the city. Each proposal shall be responsive to the questions soliciting the information and shall completely, accurately and materially supply all of the information so solicited. Any misrepresentation, failure, neglect or refusal to provide any of such information may, at the option of the city, render a proposal invalid. This requested information must be complete and verified as true by the applicant. 
(4)  Property of city. All proposals received by the city from an applicant shall become the sole property of the city. 
(5)  Applicant responsibility. Before submitting a proposal, each applicant shall be solely responsible for and must (i) examine this chapter and the request for proposals documents thoroughly, (ii) be familiar with local conditions which may in any manner affect performance under the license, including but in no event limited to, community and institutional telecommunication needs, relevant demographics, topographies, pole attachment policies of appropriate utility authorities, undergrounding, and subscriber desires, (iii) be familiar with all applicable federal, state and local laws, chapters, rules, and regulations affecting performance under the license and (iv) carefully correlate all observations with the requirements of this chapter and the request for proposals documents. 
(6)  Investigations. The city may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine the ability of the applicant to perform under the initial license, and the applicant shall furnish to the city all such information and data for this purpose as the city may request. 
(7)  Rejection. The city may reject any and all proposals from whatever source and whenever received. The city also reserves the right to waive all formalities where the best interest of the city may be served and may, if it so desires, request new or additional proposals. 
(8)  Public comment. If, upon receiving the city manager's report, the city council shall determine to further consider the proposals, the city clerk shall set at least one (1) public hearing for the consideration of proposals (i) fixing and setting forth a day, hour and place certain when and where any persons having any interest therein or who wish to file objections may file written comments or (ii) appear before the city council and be heard, and directing the city clerk to publish notice of such hearing at least once within ten (10) days of the passage thereof in the newspaper of general circulation within the city. 
(9)  Consideration. In making any determination hereunder as to any proposal for initial license, the city may consider any and all factors relevant to significant interests of the community in cable services including, but not limited to (i) the quality of the cable services proposed, (ii) areas to be served, (iii) rates to subscriber, (iv) income to the city, (v) experience, character, background and financial responsibility of any applicant and its management and owners, (vi) technical and performance quality of equipment, (vii) willingness and ability to meet construction and physical requirements, to meet all requirements set forth in this chapter, and to abide by all policy conditions, license limitations and requirements (viii) and all other matters deemed pertinent by the city for safeguarding the interests of the city and the public. 
(10)  Determination. At the time set for the hearing on proposals for an initial license, or at any continuance thereof, the city council shall proceed to hear all comments. Thereafter, the city council shall make one of the following determinations: 
a.  That such proposal be denied, which determination shall be final and conclusive; or 
b.  That such proposal be accepted and that an initial license be granted in a form approved by the city council. 
No provision of this chapter shall be deemed or construed so as to require the granting of an initial license. 
(11)  Additional information. The city may at any time demand, and applicant(s) shall provide, such supplementary, additional or other information as the city may deem reasonably necessary to determine whether the requested initial license should be granted. 
(12)  Awards based on public record. It is the intention of the city to award an initial license solely on the basis of the public record. To this end, communication with the city council by those wishing to submit proposals for an initial license shall be limited to public sessions. Requests for information should be directed to the city manager. 
(13)  City council decisions shall be final. Any decision of the city council concerning award of an initial license pursuant to this chapter shall be final. 
(j)  Duration of license. The duration of the rights, privileges and authorizations granted in license pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed fifteen (15) years. A license may be renewed by the city pursuant to the procedure established in subsection 4.5-2(k) below and in accordance with the then applicable law. 
(k)  Renewal. 
(1)  Proceedings. During the six-month period that begins with the thirty-sixth month before the expiration of an existing license, the city may, on its own initiative, and shall at the request of the licensee, commence proceedings that afford the public appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of: 
a.  Identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests; and 
b.  Reviewing the performance of the licensee under the license during the then-current license term. 
(2)  Proposal. 
a.  Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection 4.5-2(k)(1) above, the licensee seeking a renewal license may, on its own initiative and shall at the request of the city, submit a proposal for renewal license. 
b.  Subject to Section 624 of the Cable Act, such proposal shall contain such material as the city may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system. 
c.  The city may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted. 
(3)  Fees. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter, each applicant for a license renewal must furnish with its proposal a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount established by the city council, by cash, certified or cashier's check, wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the city manager made payable to the city. No proposal for a license renewal shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The fee will be used for the purpose of covering the city's cost in consideration of a renewal license proposal. The fee shall be handled in the same manner as provided for an initial license fee in subsection 4.5-2(h) of this chapter and shall, upon granting of a renewal license, be a credit against licensee fees under this chapter. 
(4)  Renewal assessment. 
a.  Upon licensee's submittal of a renewal license proposal to the city, the city shall provide prompt public notice of such renewal license proposal and, during the four-month period that begins on the completion of any proceedings under subsection 4.5-2(k)(1) above (i) issue a renewal license or (ii) issue a preliminary assessment that the license should not be renewed and, at the request of the licensee or on its own initiative commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with subsection 4.5-2(k)(4)b. A preliminary determination that a license should not be renewed shall be in writing addressing whether; 
(i)  The licensee has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing license and with applicable law; 
(ii)  The quality of the licensee's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the cable system, has been reasonable in light of community needs; 
(iii)  The licensee has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the licensee's proposal; and 
(iv)  The licensee's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests. 
b.  A renewal license proposal shall be placed on a city council agenda for public comment in the manner set forth in subsection 4.5-2(i)(8) above. The licensee shall be afforded adequate notice and the licensee and the licensor shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection 4.5-2(k)(1)), require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding. 
c.  At the completion of a proceeding under subsection 4.5-2(k)(4)b. above, the city shall (i) issue a written decision granting or denying the renewal license proposal based upon the record of such proceeding and (ii) transmit a copy of such decision to the licensee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor. 
(5)  Denial. Any denial of a renewal license proposal shall be based on one (1) or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subsections 4.5-2(k)(4)a.(i) through (iv) above, pursuant to the record of the proceeding. The city may not base a denial of a renewal license on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the license under subsection 4.5-2(k)(4)a.(i) or on events considered under subsection 4.5-2(k)(4)a.(ii) unless the city has provided the licensee with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object or has effectively acquiesced. 
(6)  Appeal. Any licensee whose renewal license proposal has been denied by a final decision of the city made pursuant to subsection 4.5-2(k)(5) above, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the city to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this subsection 4.5-2(k), may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 626 and 635 of the Cable Act. 
(7)  Informal process. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 4.5-2(k)(1) and 4.5-2(k)(5) above, the licensee may submit a renewal license proposal, together with the required fee, pursuant to this subsection 4.5-2(k)(7) at any time, and the city may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such renewal license proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this subsection 4.5-2(k) have commenced). The provisions of subsections 4.5-2(k)(1) and 4.5-2(k)(5) shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a renewal license proposal under this subsection 4.5-2(k)(7). The denial of a renewal license pursuant to this subsection 4.5-2(k)(7) shall not affect action on a renewal license proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections 4.5-2(k)(1) and 4.5-2(k)(5). 
(8)  Renewal not to affect revocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 4.5-2(k)(1) through (7) above, any lawful action to revoke this license for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent initiation of renewal proceedings by the licensee under this subsection 4.5-2(k). 
(l)  Transfers and assignments. 
(1)  A license shall not be sold, assigned, or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person, except an affiliate of licensee, without prior written consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such consent shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation in whole or in part to secure an indebtedness. The proposed assignee must show that the transfer will not cause any increased risks of nonperformance of the license or any loss to the city of its bargained-for consideration in the license. The assignee's showings must, at a minimum, detail facts sufficient to show the assignee's technical ability, financial capability, legal qualifications, general character qualifications and such other qualifications as determined by the city. The assignee must agree to comply with all provisions of the license. 
(2)  No change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the licensee shall occur without prior written consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The licensee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, transfer to or acquisition by, any other party of control of the licensee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. The sale or transfer of the license to an affiliate of a licensee does not require prior approval of the city as long as (i) the sale or transfer of the existing or newly created equity interest in the licensee does not result, directly or indirectly, in a transfer of control of the licensee and (ii) the transferee already holds an ownership interest in the licensee of twenty-five (25) percent or more. 
(3)  A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons (other than an affiliate of licensee), owning more than twenty-five (25) percent of the voting interest of the licensee or of the person exercising management authority over the licensee. 
(4)  Except in the case of an assignment of the license to an affiliate of licensee, upon written notification by the licensee to the city of a proposed assignment of the license, or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company, the city manager shall issue a written notice fixing and setting forth the day, hour and place certain when and where the city council will hold a public hearing to consider the transfer and any persons having any interest therein may appear and be heard. The city clerk shall cause such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city clerk also shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the licensee at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified for the hearing. At the time set for such hearing, or at any continuation thereof, the city council shall proceed to hear the matter. At such hearing, the city council shall determine whether the assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company will be detrimental or injurious to the best interests and welfare of the subscribers and users or the city council. City council consent to the assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company shall be by resolution at a public meeting held subsequent to the public hearing thereon. Such resolution shall thereupon become and shall be a part of any license granted under this chapter and affected thereby. 
(5)  The consent or approval of the city council to any transfer of a license shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the license. 
(6)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city council will not approve any transfer or assignment of a license within three (3) years after, and in no event prior to, substantial completion of construction of a proposed cable system. 
(7)  Notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter, each applicant for a transfer or assignment must furnish with its request a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount established by the council, by cash, certified or cashier's check, wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the city manager made payable to the City of Avondale. No proposal for a transfer or assignment of license shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The fee will be used for the purpose of covering the city's cost in consideration of a transfer or assignment of license. The fee shall be handled in the same manner as provided for an initial license fee in subsection 4.2-5(h) of this chapter and shall, upon granting the assignment or transfer, be a credit against license fees under this chapter. 
(8)  The city may reserve in the license a right of first refusal to purchase a licensee's cable system. 
(9)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership be approved without the successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the license. 
(10)  As long as a grant, rent, or lease does not amount to a transfer as defined in this subsection 4.2-5(i) and is made in the ordinary course of business with prior notice to the city, a licensee in the normal course of providing cable services or other telecommunication services may grant, rent, or lease use of its cable system to other persons. Any such use shall be restricted to and consistent with such uses as the licensee is authorized in this chapter and the license or under other applicable law. Any such use shall be in compliance with applicable federal and state law. Any such grants, lease, or rent by the licensee shall not, however, thereby relieve licensee of any requirement or obligation under its license as to its use of the public ways, and any such grant, rent, or lease shall require that such other person comply with the appropriate provisions of this chapter and the license as such use warrants. The grant, lease, or rent shall expressly provide for the authority of the city under applicable law to regulate the use provided by the grant, lease, or rent (including but not limited to the authority to protect the public welfare, safety and health) and to enforce compliance with any applicable standards established by this chapter or the license. (Ord. No. 837-02, § 2, 1-22-02) 
4.5-3 - Initial and renewal license requirements. 
(a)  Effect of award of license. 
(1)  Binding effect. Upon award of an initial or a renewal license pursuant to this chapter, a licensee shall agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in this chapter. 
(2)  Incorporation by reference of proposal for initial or renewal license. A licensee under an initial or renewal license also agrees to provide all of the cable services specifically set forth in its proposal, if provided, to provide cable services within the corporate limits of the city and by its acceptance of the initial or renewal license, the licensee specifically agrees that its proposal is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the initial or renewal license. If such proposal or the provisions of a license conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(b)  Payment of license fee. 
(1)  For the reasons that (i) the public ways that are used by the licensee in the operation of its cable system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, (ii) the grant to the licensee for the use of said public ways is a valuable property right without which the licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisition and (iii) the city will incur costs in regulating and administering the license, the licensee shall pay to the city an amount no less than five (5) percent of licensee's gross revenues during the term of the license (the "license fee"). 
(2)  Licensee agrees and acknowledges that the city is currently prohibited by federal law from changing a license fee greater than five (5) percent. Should federal regulations be amended in the future to allow the city to receive a fee greater than five (5) percent of licensee's gross revenues, the city shall have the right to increase the fee as specified in the license. 
(3)  The payment of the license fee by the licensee to the city shall be made quarterly by delivery of the same to the city manager on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of such quarter. If such payment is not timely made, the city may impose interest at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) percent per month commencing from the date payment should have been made and continuing until full payment is made. Fractions of a month shall be considered to constitute a full month for the purpose of computing interest. In addition to interest that may be assessed under this subsection 4.5-3(b)(3), if licensee fails to pay any license fee when due, licensee shall be subject to the following civil penalties: 
a.  A licensee who fails to pay the license fee or any portion thereof within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid fee each month. 
b.  A licensee who fails or refuses to pay a license fee or any portion thereof after notice and demand by the city shall pay an additional penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the unpaid fee. 
c.  If the cause of failure to pay the licensee fee or any portion thereof is determined by the city to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the license fee, the licensee shall pay an additional penalty of fifty (50) percent of the amount of deficiency. 
(4)  The city shall have the right to (i) inspect the licensee's financial records and (ii) audit and recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit of financial records from a specific licensee fiscal year shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of that same licensee fiscal year. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the licensee by the city. Said notice shall include a copy of the audit report; provided, however, that licensee shall not be required to pay such deficiency until thirty (30) days after completion of the administrative review process if licensee commences such process pursuant to subsection 4.5-7(g)(1)c. If there is a deficiency in the payment of license fees to the city of ten (10) percent or more, the city may assess the cost of the audit to the licensee. Adjustments for any overpayment by licensee will be credited to subsequent license fee payments. 
(5)  The cost to licensee of any city right-of-way construction permit, inspection, zoning review, and other fees that the city imposes under City Code requirements on licensee's construction activities shall be included in the license fee. 
(c)  Use of telephone facilities.

a.  Licensee shall provide cable services to areas meeting the minimum residential density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile. Each single family residence shall be counted as one (1) dwelling unit. Each unit in a MDU shall be counted as a dwelling unit in determining the residential density, provided a mutually acceptable agreement granting licensee reasonable access to the MDU has been executed and delivered. Licensee shall not be required to make service available to residents of multiple dwelling units where the owner of the property has not granted licensee such reasonable access to the property. 
b.  When requested by a resident or developer in the city, licensee shall, at licensee's sole expense, extend the cable system to any single family residence or dwelling within the city, provided that such extension involves density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system. Such extension(s) shall include cutting in one (1) or more taps and extending cable as necessary. 
c.  When a resident or developer in the city requests an extension of service to an area that does not meet the minimum density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system, licensee shall be required to comply with such request only if the resident or developer agrees to pay to the licensee an amount equal to all incremental costs incurred beyond those for an extension otherwise involving a density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile. The incremental costs to be paid shall be licensee's costs (reasonable labor and materials) of extending the cable system consistently with licensee's overall system design to the residence, or to and throughout the development, from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system. The costs shall include splicing in one (1) or more taps and extending cable. 
d.  When there is a request by a developer for an extension to a development that does not meet the minimum density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile and when, instead of proceeding under subsection 4.5-4(c)(1)c., the developer agrees to pay licensee's full costs (reasonable labor and materials) of extending the cable system from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system to the nearest public way access to the development, licensee shall then extend the cable system within the development, at licensee's sole cost, to any area therein that has a density of twenty-five (25) existing dwelling units per mile, as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest public way access to the development to which the developer paid to have the cable system extended. 
e.  To prevent unnecessary disruption and damage to public ways and other property, the installation of cable system shall be accomplished in new subdivisions at the same time, and in the same trench as other communications, electric, and other permanent services to structures. Except as federal law may grant them other rights, developers of new residential buildings or mobile homes within a new or undeveloped subdivision, new residential units within new multiple occupancy residential developments, and new commercial and industrial buildings and structures shall treat cable television facilities as they treat other communication facilities, utilities, and other underground facilities regarding availability and cost of trenching for undergroundings. 
f.  Absent a showing by licensee to the city manager of circumstances beyond licensee's reasonable control, an extension of service pursuant to subsections 4.5-4(c)(1)c., d. and e. above shall be accomplished within one hundred twenty (120) days of the developer or resident's request. 
(2)  Commercial service. Licensee shall make cable services available to commercial establishments as follows except that licensee shall not be required to make service available to commercial establishments where the owner of the property has not granted licensee reasonable access to the property: 
a.  When requested by the owner of a commercial establishment, provided that no plant extension and nothing more than a standard drop is required to make such cable services available. 
b.  When the owner of a commercial or industrial establishment within the city requests an extension of service and such establishment is not in an area with a minimum of one hundred (100) hook-ups per cable plant mile, licensee shall be required to comply with such request only if such owner pays to licensee an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by licensee over and above the cost of a standard drop in making cable services available to such owner's commercial establishment. Absent a showing by licensee to the city manager of unusual circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, an extension of service pursuant to this subsection 4.5-4(c)(2)b. shall be accomplished within one hundred twenty (120) days of owner's execution of any necessary easement documents and capital contribution agreements. 
(3)  Service drops. 
a.  Licensee shall make service available to any single-family residence or any commercial establishment within the city at the standard connection charge if the connection requires a standard drop. 
b.  If making service available requires more than a standard drop, licensee shall not be required to make such service available unless the person or entity requesting such service pays to licensee (i) the standard connection charge and (ii) an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by licensee for the additional facilities and work. 
c.  Licensee may offer bulk billing service, but shall not require a bulk billing agreement as a condition of providing service, if the person or entity requesting service pays to licensee the applicable amount(s) set forth in subsections 4.5-4(c)(3)a. and b. above. 
d.  Absent a showing by licensee to the city manager of unusual circumstances, including without limitation the necessity for street crossings, (i) any standard drop to a single family residence or dwelling shall be accomplished within ten (10) days of the request for service, and (ii) any drop that is not a standard drop shall be accomplished within twenty (20) days of such request.

Articles: 
Article I - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT* 
  
Sections: 
Division 1. - In General 

8-1 - Statutory authorization. 
    Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 48-3610, the City of Avondale (the "city") is authorized to adopt floodplain management regulations in conformance with Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 48-3603 and 48-3609 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
8-2 - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
8-3 - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions, 
(9)  Maintain eligibility for disaster relief. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
8-4 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
(a)  These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. 
(b)  In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10)

    "Floodplain management." The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations." The ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

    "Flood-related erosion." The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    "Flood-related erosion area or flood-related erosion prone area." A land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

    "Fraud and victimization." As related to section 8-30(e)(4) of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the city for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the city as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use." A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

    "Governing body." The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship." As related to sections 8-28(a) and 8-30(e)(2) of this article, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade." The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure." Any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(B)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee." A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system." A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article. 
    "Manufactured home." A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision." A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value." "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. 
(1)  The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. 
(2)  The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. 
(3)  Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

    "New construction." For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial flood insurance rate map or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision." A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    "Obstruction."

    "Program deficiency." A defect in the city's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
    "Public safety and nuisance." As related to section 8-30(e)(4) of this article, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle." A vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

    "Regulatory floodway." The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    "Remedy a violation." To bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine." Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sheet flow area." See "area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)." An area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood boundary and floodway map or flood insurance rate map as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
    "Start of construction." Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure." A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage." Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
    "Substantial improvement." Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance." A grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. 
    "Violation." The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation." The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

8-11 - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the State of Arizona or FEMA, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10)

8-27 - Floodways. 
(a)  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-7 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within a regulatory floodway are prohibited, unless a registered professional engineer or architect has demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge and such registered professional engineer or architect has certified the analysis described in this subsection. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, encroachments within the regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations may be permitted, provided that the city first applies for a conditional flood insurance rate map and floodway revision and fulfills the requirement for such revisions as established under the provision of Article 44, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Section 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator 
(3)  If this section 8-27 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(b)  Flood related erosion-prone area. 
(1)  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the city. 
(2)  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
(3)  If a proposed development is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvements shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
(4)  A setback is required for all new development from any lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
Division 4. - Variance Procedure 

8-28 - Nature of variances. 
(a)  The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
(b)  It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
8-29 - Appeal board. 
(a)  The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  In passing upon such applications, the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and, 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges. 
(d)  Upon consideration of the factors of this section 8-29 and the purposes of this article, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance that are commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and 
(3)  A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder and shall be recorded by the floodplain board in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(f)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to FEMA. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10) 
8-30 - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of divisions 2 and 3 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
(3)  Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in section 8-5 of this article in the definition of "functionally dependent use"; and 
(4)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. (Ord. No. 1409-510, § 2, 5-3-10)

For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Division 1 - General 

20-30 - Applicability. 
    This article is intended to regulate the activities and responsibilities of those persons who purchase, rent or lease alarm systems and those persons who own or operate the business of selling, renting, leasing, installing, maintaining, monitoring or servicing alarms or alarm systems. It is further intended to encourage the improvement in reliability of such alarms and alarm systems and to ensure that police department personnel will not be unduly diverted from responding to actual criminal activity as a result of responding to false alarms. This article specifically encompasses audible, monitored, robbery, burglary or panic alarm and alarm systems. The provisions of this article shall not apply to (a) alarms or alarm systems owned and/or operated by the city, county, state, or federal government and installed on premises which such entity occupies or uses for governmental purposes, (b) audible alarms affixed to automobiles or (c) smoke detectors or fire alarms in single-family residences that are not connected to an alarm monitoring company. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-31 - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    "Act of God" means an unusual, extraordinary, sudden and unexpected manifestation of the forces of nature, which cannot be prevented by reasonable human care, skill or foresight. 
    "Alarm or alarm system" means any instrument, device or system which is used for the purpose of protecting buildings, places or premises from criminal acts or unauthorized entries by warning persons of a crime or an unauthorized entry through the emission or transmission of an alarm signal including audible, monitored, and robbery, burglary or panic alarm systems. 
    "Alarm administrator" means a person, persons or independent contractor hired by the city to administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer the provisions of this chapter. 
    "Alarm agent" means any person who is employed by an alarm business either directly or indirectly, and whose duties include selling, renting, leasing, installing, maintaining, monitoring or servicing alarms or alarm systems in or on any building, place or premises. Any person whose duties consist solely of resetting an alarm or alarm system following activation shall not be deemed to be an alarm agent. 
    "Alarm business" means any owner or operator of a business that sells, rents, leases, installs, maintains, monitors or services alarms or alarm systems. 
    "Alarm signal" means a detectable signal; audible or visual, including an inaudible (silent) signal to a central monitoring station, generated by an alarm system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond. 
    "Alarm system user" means any person who (which) leases, rents, purchases, or uses any alarm, alarm system, device, or service. 
    "Audible alarm" means an alarm or alarm system designed for the detection of a criminal act or an unauthorized entry on building, places or premises and which, when activated, generates an audible sound on the premises. 
    "Cancellation" means the process where response is terminated when the alarm business (designated by the alarm system user) notifies the police department that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil/criminal penalty, and no penalty will be assessed. 
    "Common cause" means a common technical difficulty or malfunction that causes an alarm or alarm system to generate a series of false alarms within a twenty-four-hour period, for which the responsible subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner has taken action to rectify the cause of the false alarms and the alarm or alarm system generates no additional false alarms from the same common technical difficulty or malfunction for a period of thirty (30) days thereafter. 
    "False alarm" means any activation of an alarm or alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm system user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the alarm system user or the alarm system user's agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the police department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm or alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include (i) an activation caused by the police department (ii) an activation for testing purposes when the police department has been given advance notice of such testing (iii) an activation which can reasonably be determined to have been caused by an act of God or (iv) other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm system user. 
    "Fraudulent verification" means the reporting of a burglary alarm to the police department, for the purpose of obtaining a police response to the alarm, knowing that the alarm is not a verified alarm. 
    "Monitored alarm" means an alarm or alarm system designed for the detection of a criminal act or unauthorized entry in a building, place or premises, and which, when activated, generates an alarm signal. 
    "Robbery or panic alarm" means an alarm or alarm system designed for the detection of a robbery or the commission of an unlawful act, and which, when intentionally activated by a person, generates an inaudible (silent) signal to a central monitoring station. A robbery or panic alarm may also generate an audible sound on the premises. 
    "Person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, incorporated association and any other legal entity. 
    "Property alarm," "intrusion alarm" or "burglary alarm" mean any system, device or mechanism for detection and reporting of any unauthorized entry or attempted entry or property damage upon real property protected by the system which may be activated by sensors and, when activated, transmits a telephonic, wireless, electronic, video, or other form of message, or emits an audible or visible signal that can be heard or seen by persons outside the protected premises, or transmits a signal beyond the protected premises. For purposes of this article, alarms on automatic teller machines (ATMs) are included in this definition. 
    "Proprietor alarm" means any alarm or alarm system that is not rented, leased, installed, maintained, monitored or serviced by an alarm business. 
    "Responder" means a private guard, alarm company guard, private entity, or person contacted by an alarm business, or any other person, who verifies that there is evidence of intrusion, commission of an unlawful act, or emergency on the premises that would warrant a call for police assistance or investigation for a property, intrusion, or burglary alarm. Responders for alarm businesses requesting police response will notify the police dispatcher of the name of the alarm business that requested them to respond. Responders will meet police at the premises, unless the responder verified the burglary alarm by other than at-the-site visual verification. 
    "Subscriber" means any person who rents or leases an alarm or alarm system, or purchases, rents or leases any monitored alarm or robbery, burglary or panic alarm from an alarm business. 
    "Verify" means an attempt by an alarm business, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm system user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. 
    "Verified alarm" means an alarm for which a responder has verified that a crime, attempted crime, or other emergency occurring at the premises protected by the alarm is occurring or about to occur. Verification may be by any of the methods set forth in section 20-45 below. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13)

The subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner, as applicable, may request that the City provide documentation of the two (2) false alarms. In the event the subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner believes the information of false alarms to be incorrect, an appeal may be filed with the police chief subject to subsection 20-40(b) below. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13)

(b)  A subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner, as applicable, may appeal the determination of false alarms or the penalty to be assessed under section 20-41 below, as applicable, by submitting a report to the chief of police, or authorized designee, within twenty (20) days of the date of mailing of the police department's, or authorized designee's, written notification.

With respect to subscribers only, evidence that the false alarm was due to defective equipment or other fault of the alarm business shall relieve the subscriber from liability and shall shift the responsibility to the alarm business monitoring the alarm or alarm system. 
(c)  If the report required in subsection (b) is not submitted within the specified time period, the subscriber, alarm business or a proprietor alarm owner shall have waived any rights to any further review or hearing and the subscriber, alarm business or the proprietor alarm owner operating the alarm system generating the false alarms shall be liable for the assessment imposed under section 20-41 below.

If the chief of police, or authorized designee, determines that the corrective action taken or to be taken will substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms or that a valid reason for the false alarm(s) has been shown, a written notice will be sent by mail to the subscriber, alarm business or the proprietor alarm owner, as applicable, at the address registered with the police department, or authorized designee, indicating that no assessment will be imposed for that particular false alarm(s). The notice shall set forth the findings and conclusions of the chief of police, or authorized designee, with respect to the review of the report submitted. 
(e)  If the chief of police, or authorized designee, determines that the corrective action taken or to be taken will not substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms or that a valid reason for the false alarm(s) has not been shown, a written notice shall be sent by mail to the subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner, as applicable, at the address registered with the police department, or authorized designee, that the subscriber, alarm business or proprietor alarm owner, as applicable, is liable for the assessment imposed under section 20-41 below.

(d)  The subscriber (or the alarm business if, pursuant to subsection 20-40(b)(2), the burden has shifted) shall be responsible for the payment of assessment(s) imposed for false alarms related to an alarm system serviced by the alarm business. The proprietor alarm owner shall be responsible for the payment of assessment(s) imposed for false alarms related to the owner's proprietor alarm system. 
(e)  Failure to pay assessments on the fourth and any subsequent false alarm(s) shall result in the alarm or alarm system being placed on verified alarm status as provided in this article, until such assessments have been paid.

Division 3 - Verified Response 

20-45 - Verified response required for delinquent accounts. 
(a)  Pursuant to subsection 20-41(e), the police department will not respond to property alarms, intrusion alarms or burglary alarms of subscribers and proprietor alarm owners with delinquent false alarm assessments, unless such alarms are verified alarms as defined by this article. Verification may be by any of the following: 
(1)  At-the-site visual verification. 
(2)  Through the use of a remote audio or video system monitored by an alarm business. 
(3)  Two (2) separate alarm activations monitored by an alarm business from the same premises within a ten-minute period, which activations are triggered from the same or different motion sensors or devices. 
(4)  Any other form of verification as may from time to time be adopted as policy by the police department and published on the city's website. 
(b)  In reporting such an alarm to the police department, an alarm business or proprietor alarm owner must confirm that the alarm is a verified alarm. It shall be presumed that an alarm business or proprietor alarm owner that reports an alarm as a verified alarm has actually verified that alarm. Even if an alarm is verified, exigent circumstances may arise that prevent the police department from responding to verified alarm activations due to the availability of resources. The police department is under no legal duty or obligation whatsoever to respond to any property alarm, intrusion alarm or burglary alarm activation and may respond, in its discretion, as police resources allow and as police chief deems appropriate. 
(c)  An alarm business that reports a verified burglary alarm to the police department is required to maintain the evidence it used to verify that alarm activation, or a written report thereof, for not less than twelve (12) months from the date of the alarm activation, except as to recordings of remote audio or video surveillance, which must be maintained for not less than sixty (60) days. Because the police department will accept the alarm business' representation that it verified the alarm before reporting it to the police department as a verified alarm, the police department shall have the right to audit the alarm business to ensure that the alarm business is not misrepresenting that fact to the police department. If the police department has reasonable suspicion that an alarm business has misrepresented an unverified alarm to be a verified burglary alarm, it may send the alarm business written notice of the date and time of the reported verified burglary alarm and request the alarm business produce to the police department the evidence and/or report substantiating the verification of that burglary alarm activation. The alarm business shall produce the requested items to the police department within fourteen (14) days of the mailing of notice. If the alarm business fails to maintain the evidence and/or report for the specified period of time or fails to produce the requested items to the police department, the alarm business will not be entitled to the presumption set forth in subsection 20-45(b) above. If the alarm business intentionally destroys, fails to maintain for the time period specified above, discards the evidence and/or report, or intentionally fails to produce the requested items to the police department that have been maintained and do exist, the alarm business shall be presumed to have made a fraudulent verification. Such presumption may be overcome by the alarm business producing evidence that in requesting a police response to the burglary alarm in issue, it did not know that the alarm was unverified. 
(d)  If the police department has reasonable suspicion that a proprietor alarm owner has misrepresented an unverified alarm to be a verified burglary alarm, the police chief or authorized designee may send the proprietor alarm owner written notice of the date and time of the reported verified burglary alarm and request the proprietor alarm owner produce to the police department the evidence substantiating the verification of that burglary alarm activation. The proprietor alarm owner shall produce the requested evidence to the police department within fourteen (14) days of the mailing of notice. If the proprietor alarm owner fails to produce the requested evidence to the police department the proprietor alarm owner will not be entitled to the presumption set forth in subsection 20-45(b) above and shall instead be presumed to have made a fraudulent verification. Such presumption may be overcome by the proprietor alarm owner producing evidence that the alarm was verified. 
(e)  Police department response to robbery alarms, panic alarms and medic alarms does not require a prior verified response. Exigent circumstances may arise, however that prevent the police department from responding to alarm activations due to the availability of resources. The police department is under no legal duty or obligation whatsoever to respond to any alarm activation and may respond, in its discretion, as police resources allow and as police chief deems appropriate. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-46 - Fraudulent verification administrative fines. 
(a)  Fraudulent verification administrative fine. An alarm business or proprietor alarm owner shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of the invoice, an administrative fine for each fraudulent verification. The amount of the administrative fine shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) per fraudulent verification. 
(b)  The fraudulent verification fines are cumulative and not exclusive. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-47 - Penalties for failure to pay fines. 
(a)  Payment of any administrative fine under this article is due within thirty (30) days from the invoice date or within an extension of time granted by the police chief or his authorized designee. If payment is received between one (1) and thirty (30) days after the date it became due, there shall be added to the amount a penalty of ten (10) percent of the fines owing. If payment is later than thirty (30) days after the date due, a penalty of twenty (20) percent of the fines shall be assessed. If payment is not received within sixty (60) days of the date due, then interest shall accrue on the unpaid fines and penalties at one (1) percent per month until paid in full. 
(b)  The alarm business or proprietor alarm owner shall be notified by mail of the amount of any penalties so added or assessed, and the same shall become due and shall be paid within ten (10) days from the date of such notice. 
(c)  If any administrative fines or penalties remain unpaid after ninety (90) days from the invoice date, the city or authorized designee may take legal action to collect all unpaid fines or penalties. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-48 - Mailing of notices. 
    Any notice required by this article to be mailed shall be sent by ordinary mail, addressed to the address as reflected in the records of the city. Failure to receive such notice shall not relieve the obligation to pay any fee, interest, or penalty, nor shall such failure extend any time limit. It is the responsibility of the alarm business to inform the city manager or authorized designee in writing about a change in address. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-49 - Police department delegation of duties. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this section, the police chief is authorized to delegate to any other police department employee or to a private entity all duties of the police department as set forth in this article. The police chief may not delegate any duty specifically reserved to law enforcement. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-50 - No duty or obligation. 
    Nothing in this article imposes or creates any express or implied duties or obligations on the part of the city, its police department or any other governmental agency. Nothing in this article creates any express or implied duty or obligation for the police department to respond to an alarm activation of any sort, whether verified or not. Any and all liability or consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to an alarm activation of any sort is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained by the city. (Ord. No. 1527-1013, § 2, 10-7-13) 
20-51 - Powers of the chief of police. 
    The police chief shall have broad discretion to promulgate, execute and enforce policies, procedures and directives as may in his discretion be necessary to implement the provisions of this article. Such powers shall include, but are not limited to, the power to promulgate, execute and enforce a policy regarding dispatch of officers to verified and unverified alarm activations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this article.

An approved air gap shall be at least double the effective opening of the supply piping or faucet and in no case less than one (1) inch above the flood rim. 
    "Approved backflow prevention assemblies" mean assemblies that have been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association entitled: AWWA/ANSI C 510-2007 Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly and AWWA/ANSI C511-2007 Standard for Reduced-Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly and have met completely the laboratory and field performance standard of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California (USC FCCCHR) established in Chapter 10 of the most current edition of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control (Standards of Backflow Prevention Assemblies). 
    "Backflow" is the undesirable reversal of flow of non-potable water or other substance through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or consumer's potable water system. There are two types of backflow: backpressure backflow and backsiphonage. 
    "Backflow prevention method" means an assembly or other means designed to prevent backflow. 
    "Backpressure backflow" is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increase in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains. 
    "Backsiphonage" is backflow caused by a negative pressure (i.e., vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. The effect is similar to drinking water through a straw. Backsiphonage can occur when there is a stoppage of water supply due to nearby firefighting, a break in a water main, etc. 
    "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of water from any portion of a customer's or unauthorized user's connection to the city's potable water. 
    "Certified tester" is someone trained and certified through a certification program approved by the American Backflow Prevention Association with proper training in the most current edition Manual of Cross-Connection Control test procedures and approved by the City of Avondale. 
    "Contamination" means any condition, device or practice which, in the judgment of the Department, may create a danger to public's health and well-being. This includes an impairment of the public water supply by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance that degrades the water quality and creates a health hazard. 
    "Cross connection" is any temporary or permanent connection between a public water system or consumers' potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing non-potable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumers' potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system, or irrigation system. 
    "Customer" means a person or entity with a valid city water account. 
    "Department" means the Avondale Public Works Department. 
    "Director" is the individual in charge of the Avondale Public Works Department and its daily operations or his authorized designee. 
    "Double check detector assembly (DCDA or DDCVA)" means an assembly composed of a line-size approved double check valve assembly with a bypass containing a specific water meter and an approved double check valve assembly. 
    "Double check valve assembly (DCVA)" means an assembly composed of two independently acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and fitted with properly-located test cocks. 
    "Potable water supply" is raw or treated water that is considered safe to drink. 
    "Pressure vacuum breaker assembly (PVB)" means an assembly containing an independently operating, loaded check valve and an independently operating, loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly shall be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly. 
    "Reduced-pressure assembly (RPA)" means an assembly containing two (2) independently-acting, approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves, and below the first check valve. The assembly shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly. 
    "Reduced-pressure detector assembly (RPDA)" means an assembly composed of a line-size approved reduced-pressure assembly with a bypass containing a specific water meter and an approved reduced-pressure assembly. 
    "Spill-resistant pressure vacuum breaker (SVB)" means an assembly containing an independently operating, internally loaded check valve and independently operating, loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly shall be equipped with a properly located resilient seated test cock, properly located bleed/vent valve and tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly. 
    "Water service connection" is any direct connection to the City of Avondale potable water system. (Ord. No. 1572-315, § 2, 3-16-15) 
24-2 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of Avondale Backflow Prevention Program is to protect the public water supply from contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's system such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water supply and to provide for the monitoring and enforcement of the program. This is accomplished by inspecting water service connections to determine compliance with the City Code related to backflow, tracking the annual testing of privately-owned backflow prevention assemblies to ensure proper operation, and investigating water quality complaints and backflow incidents. The objectives of this article are to: 
(a)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare through a cross-connection control and backflow prevention program intended to prevent the potential or actual occurrence where a backflow, backpressure condition, or cross connection within piping, or other portions of customers' potable water systems could allow the entry of contaminants or pollutants into the public water supply system. 
(b)  Eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or potential, at each water outlet from the customer's service line. 
(c)  Provide a continuing inspection program of backflow prevention methods that will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections that may be installed in the future. 
(d)  Provide standards on the proper types and usage of backflow prevention methods.

(W)  Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by FIFRA. 
(X)  Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(1)  Users must comply with the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such categorical pretreatment standards shall include any revised standards in the event that a user obtains a fundamentally different factors variance from the EPA on the basis of 40 CFR 403.13. 
(2)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(3)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual IUs. 
(4)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(5)  A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following subsections: 
(A)  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the IU's intake water in accordance with this section. Any IU wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the IU, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of subsection (b) of this section are met. 
(B)  Criteria. 
(i)  Either (a) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (b) the IU demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
(ii)  Credit for generic pollutants such as BOD, TSS, and oil and grease should not be granted unless the IU demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
(iii)  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
(iv)  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
(d)  Arizona Pretreatment Standards. Users shall comply with all Arizona Pretreatment Standards or Requirements codified at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 49-255.02, as amended, and at Ariz. Admin. Code. § R18-9-A906, as amended, or any other state pretreatment standards wherever codified, as amended. State regulations require the use of all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment; and prohibit the discharge of pollutants to the POTW. In the event of any conflict between the categorical pretreatment standards and Arizona Pretreatment Standards, users shall comply with the more stringent standard. 
(e)  Local limits. 
(1)  All persons owning or operating facilities or engaged in activities that will or may reasonably be expected to result in pollutants entering the city's sanitary sewer system or affecting the sanitary sewer system or affecting the POTW, shall undertake all practicable BMP identified by the director to minimize the discharge of pollutants. Such measures shall include the requirements imposed by this article, any applicable NPDES or AZPDES Permits, and any written guidelines promulgated for general use by the director. 
(2)  The director shall have the authority to: 
(A)  Establish limitations for individual users or classes of users for various pollutants, materials, waters, or wastes that can be accepted into the sanitary sewer system; 
(B)  Specify those pollutants, materials, waters, or wastes that are prohibited from entering the sanitary sewer system; 
(C)  Identify those pollutants, materials, waters, or wastes that shall be controlled with BMP; and 
(D)  Require individual users or classes of users to implement BMP for any pollutant. 
(3)  All affected individual users or classes of users shall comply with the prohibitions and effluent limitations established pursuant to this section, and with any BMP required by the director. 
(4)  All prohibitions and effluent limitations so established and all BMP identified by the director will be placed on file with the city clerk and will become effective and enforceable on the 31st day after the date of filing. 
(5)  The following pollutant limitations are established to protect the POTW against pass through and interference. No user shall discharge wastewater exceeding the limits set forth below: 
Daily Average Effluent Limitations Substance Effective on July 1, 2011 Ammonia 75.0 mg/l Arsenic 0.41 mg/l BOD 5 450 mg/l Cadmium 0.09 mg/l Chromium 1.2 mg/l Copper 3.0 mg/l Cyanide 1.75 mg/l Lead 1.6 MH/L Mercury 0.12 mg/l Nickel 0.63 mg/l Oil and Grease 100 mg/l Selenium 0.69 mg/l Silver 3.85 mg/l Total Suspended Solids 450 mg/l Zinc 4.75 mg/l  
All concentrations are expressed in the "total" form unless indicated otherwise. The director may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
(f)  Right of revision. The director reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance requirements with a categorical pretreatment standard, or a federal or state pretreatment requirement. The city reserves the right to establish new, additional or more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this article. 
(g)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of potable or process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users that he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 1452-511, §§ 3-5, 5-16-11) 
24-104 - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities and equipment. 
(1)  Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 24-103(a) of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the director. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(2)  The user shall obtain all necessary construction/operating permits from the city and any other permits necessary and administered by other agencies. Any subsequent significant changes in the pretreatment facilities or equipment, or method of operation shall be reported to and be accepted by the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. The user shall control production and/or discharges upon reduction, loss, failure, or by-pass of the treatment facility or equipment until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Flow control. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  Grease, oil, hair, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, hair, and sand interceptors shall be required when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of FOG, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the director and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense. 
(4)  Flammable substance detection. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug load control plans. 
(1)  The director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan within thirty (30) days of issuing the initial wastewater discharge permit and upon the renewal of any subsequent wastewater discharge permit. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. 
(2)  Where deemed necessary by the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug loads of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An ASPP showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within sixty (60) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of sections 24-103 and this section 24-104. 
(3)  Any user required to develop and implement an ASPP shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(a)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(b)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(c)  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug load discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would cause noncompliance with any of the standards in section 24-103 of these rules; and 
(d)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug load discharge. Such processes include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(4)  User shall notify the city immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug load" or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by these rules. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines or costs incurred by the city on account thereof under local, state or federal law. 
(5)  Within five (5) calendar days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by these rules or other applicable law. 
(6)  Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees who to call in the event of a slug load or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. 
(d)  Hauled septic tank and industrial wastewater. 
(1)  The POTW shall not accept hauled industrial wastewater. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-105 - Individual or general wastewater discharge permit required. 
(a)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the director, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within ten (10) days of the request. The director is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(b)  Individual and general wastewater discharge permit requirements. 
(1)  No SIU shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit from the director, except that an SIU that has filed a timely application pursuant to section 24-105(c) of this article may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
(2)  All users shall submit a completed industrial pretreatment survey when applying to discharge wastewater into the POTW. The industrial pretreatment survey shall be made available at the city's development services department upon user's application for sewer service. 
(3)  The director may require other users to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. 
(4)  Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in sections 24-111 through 24-113 of this article. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law. 
(c)  Individual and general wastewater discharge permitting; existing connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this article and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within thirty (30) days after said date, apply to the director for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit in accordance with section 24-105(e) of this article, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after thirty (30) days of the effective date of this article except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit issued by the director. 
(d)  Individual and general wastewater discharge permitting; new connections. Any user required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, in accordance with section 24-105(e) of this article, must be filed at least thirty (30) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
(e)  Individual and general wastewater discharge permit application contents. 
(1)  All users required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit must submit a permit application. Users that are eligible may request a general permit under section 24-105(f). The director may require users to submit all or some of the following information as part of a permit application:

(iii)  Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. 
(iv)  The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 24-107(j) of this article. Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the director or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
(v)  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 24-107(k) of this article. 
(F)  Any requests for a monitoring waiver (or a renewal of an approved monitoring waiver) for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge based on section 24-107(d)(2). 
(G)  Any request to be covered by a general permit based on section 24-105(f). 
(H)  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the director to evaluate the permit application. 
(2)  Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. 
(f)  Wastewater discharge permitting: General permits. 
(1)  At the discretion of the director, the director may use general permits to control IU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must: 
(A)  Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
(B)  Discharge the same types of wastes; 
(C)  Require the same effluent limitations; 
(D)  Require the same or similar monitoring; and 
(E)  In the opinion of the director, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  To be covered by the general permit, the IU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with section 24-107(d)(2) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after the director has provided written notice to the IU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with section 24-107(d)(2). 
(3)  The director will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a specific IU meets the criteria in sections 24-105(f)(1)(A) through (E) and applicable state regulations, and a copy of the user's written request for coverage for three (3) years after the expiration of the general permit. 
(4)  The director may not control an IU through a general permit where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula (section 24-103(c)(4))or net/gross calculations (section 24-192(c)(5)). 
(g)  Application signatories and certifications. 
(1)  All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports and certification statements must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the certification statement in section 24-107(n)(1). 
(2)  If the designation of an authorized representative is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the requirements of this section must be submitted to the director prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(3)  A facility determined to be a NSCIU by the director pursuant to this article and 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit the signed certification statement in section 24-107(n)(2). 
(h)  Individual wastewater discharge and general permit decisions. The director will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete permit application, the director will determine whether to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit. The director may deny any application for an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 1452-511, § 6, 5-16-11) 
24-106 - Individual and general wastewater discharge permit issuance. 
(a)  Individual and general wastewater discharge permit duration.

User with an expiring individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall apply for individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with section 24-105(e) of this article, a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-107 - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMRs). 
(1)  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing CIUs currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become CIUs subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
(A)  All information required in section 24-105(e)(1)(A)(i), section 24-105(e)(1)(B), section 24-105(e)(1)(C)(i), and section 24-105(e)(1)(F). 
(B)  Measurement of pollutants. 
(i)  The user shall provide the information required in sections 24-105(e)(1)(G)(i) through (iv). 
(ii)  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
(iii)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority; 
(iv)  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with section 24-107(j); 
(v)  The director may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
(vi)  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(C)  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative as defined in section 24-102 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional O&M and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(D)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 24-107(b) of this article. 
(E)  Signature and report certification. All BMRs must be certified in accordance with section 24-107(n)(1) of this article and signed by an authorized representative as defined in section 24-102. 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. 
(1)  The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by section 24-107(a)(2)(D) of this article: 
(A)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(B)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(C)  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(D)  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in sections 24-105(e)(1)(F) and (G) and section 24-107(a)(2)(B) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in section 24-103(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 24-107(n)(1) of this article. All sampling will be done in conformance with section 24-107(k). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  Except as specified in section 24-107(d)(3), all SIUs must, at a frequency determined by the director submit no less than twice per year (in June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  The city may authorize an IU subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the IU has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the IU. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(A)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(B)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See section 24-105(e)(1)(H). 
(C)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the IU must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(D)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized representative of the user, and include the certification statement in section 24-107(n)(1) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
(E)  Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(F)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the director for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver. 
(G)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the director, the IU must certify on each report with the statement in section 24-107(n)(3) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the IU. 
(H)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of section 24-107(d)(1), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the director, and notify the director. 
(I)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(3)  The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the EPA or ADEQ, where the IU's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
(A)  Five thousand (5,000) gpd, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the IU discharges in batches; 
(B)  Two hundred fifty (250) lbs per day of organic load. 
(4)  Reduced reporting is not available to IUs that have in the last two (2) years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in section 24-102 of this article. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an IU with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the director, decreasing the reporting requirement for this IU would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(5)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 24-107(n)(1) of this article. 
(6)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(7)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by director, using the procedures prescribed in section 24-107(k) of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. 
(1)  Each user must notify the director of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least forty-five (45) days before the change. 
(2)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 24-105(e) of this article. 
(3)  The director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under section 24-106(g) of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under section 24-106(d) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  SIUs are required to notify the director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. 
(1)  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(2)  Resampling by the IU is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the IU. 
(3)  If the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the IU, the city must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Discharge of hazardous waste into the POTW is prohibited. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include: 
(A)  The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, 
(B)  The EPA hazardous waste number, and 
(C)  The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). 
(D)  If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: 
(i)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes. 
(ii)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month. 
(iii)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. 
(2)  All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged; provided, however, that notification of changed conditions must be submitted under section 24-107(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-107(a), 24-107(c) and 24-107(d)of this article. 
(3)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(4)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and Arizona Department of Environmental Quality of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(5)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(6)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the director or other parties approved by EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(2)  Except as indicated in sections 24-107(k)(3) and (4) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(3)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(4)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in sections 24-107(a) and 24-107(c), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 24-107(d), the IU is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with any BMP established under section 24-103. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(n)  Certification statements. 
(1)  The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with section 24-105(g); users submitting BMRs under section 24-107(a)(2)(E); users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under section 24-107(c); users submitting periodic compliance reports required by section 24-107(d)(1) through (4), and users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of section 24-107(d)(2)(D). The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative of the user as defined in section 24-102:

(3)  Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an approved monitoring waiver based on section 24-107(d)(2) must certify on each report with the following statement that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the user. 
    Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR ____________ [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ____________ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under section 24-107(d)(1) of the Avondale Code. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-108 - Inspection and compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry; access; unreasonable delay. 
(1)  Upon providing the notice, identification and disclosures as required by state law to be provided on or before the initiation of the inspection (unless a different time frame is established by Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 9-833, as amended), the director shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the provisions of these rules, and any discharge permit or order issued hereunder, are being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. Users may elect to have a representative accompany the city representative during the inspection, except during confidential interviews. The inspection shall be in accordance with state law. 
(2)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security personnel so that, upon presentation of city identification, the city will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(3)  The director shall have the right to set upon the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's discharge. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's premises shall constitute noncompliance with these rules. 
(b)  Monitoring facilities. 
(1)  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. When required by the city, each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of the sewer discharge to the POTW. The user's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user. Subject to approval by the jurisdictional road authority, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or rights-of-way, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The city, whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations where appropriate. 
(2)  There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(3)  All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
(4)  All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy. The director may require any measurement device to be calibrated more frequently. 
(c)  Search warrants. If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the municipal court of the city. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the city in the company of a uniformed police officer of the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction. All costs associated with obtaining the search warrant incurred by the city shall be borne by the property owner and shall be recoverable by the city in accordance with applicable law. 
(d)  Vandalism. No person shall willfully or negligently damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in noncompliance with this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in these rules. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 1573-315, § 1, 3-16-15) 
24-109 - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, general permits and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable federal and state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the AZPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined at 40 CFR Part 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-110 - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
(a)  Significant noncompliance list. The director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of all users that, at any time during the previous four (4) quarters, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all SIUs (or any other IU that violates subsections (3), (4) or (8) of this section) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in section 24-103; 
(2)  TRC violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by section 22-103 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, FOG, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 24-103 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date, any required reports, including BMRs, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of BMP, which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-111 - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of noncompliance. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation, via certified mail, return receipt requested. Within seven (7) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the noncompliance and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city's pretreatment coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any noncompliance occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 24-111(d) and 24-111(e) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user and required by section 24-105(g)(1). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Any compliance order issued under this subsection shall be served upon the user by certified mail, return receipt requested. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. 
(1)  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(A)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(B)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(2)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(3)  Any cease and desist order issued under this subsection shall be served upon the user by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(f)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(2)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving water, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 24-111(h) of these rules are initiated against the user. 
(3)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement within ten (10) days, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-111(c) and 24-111(h) of these rules. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(g)  Termination of discharge (nonemergency). 
(1)  In addition to the provisions in section 24-106(f) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(A)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit conditions; 
(B)  Noncompliance with discharge permit conditions; 
(C)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(D)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(E)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(F)  Noncompliance with the pretreatment standards in sections 24-103 and 24-104 of these rules. 
(G)  Failure to timely pay any sewer user fees or charges, fines, or penalties authorized or required by this article. 
(2)  Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-111(c) of these rules why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(h)  Cost recovery assessment. When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, and the city incurs costs associated with said noncompliance, the director may assess such user an amount not to exceed said costs. City costs may include, but not be limited to operations and maintenance costs, including labor and overhead, equipment cost, and penalties and fines, plus the expense, loss, damage, cost of inspection or cost of correction incurred by the city by reason of such noncompliance, including any expenses or reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the city in collecting from such user any penalty, fine, loss, damage, expense, cost of inspection or cost of correction. 
(i)  Enforcement response plan and penalty policy. 
(1)  The director is authorized to develop and submit to the city council for its approval by resolution: 
(A)  An enforcement response plan; and 
(B)  Penalty policy. 
(2)  Any enforcement response plan will at a minimum satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(5). Any penalty policy shall establish the factors to be considered and the method of calculating administrative fines to be assessed pursuant to section 24-111(f) and the factors to be considered in utilizing the judicial enforcement remedies set forth in section 24-112 of this article. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 1452-511, §§ 7, 8, 5-16-11) 
24-112 - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition the Superior Court of Arizona through the city's counsel for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per violation, per day in accordance with Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 49-391. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A person who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other applicable federal, state or local pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a class one misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. 
(2)  A person who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction for violation of this article, be guilty of a class one misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state or federal law. 
(3)  A person who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in sections 24-112 through 24-114 of these rules are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of noncompliance incidents will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-113 - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Penalties for late reports. A penalty in a sum not to exceed the base fine for a civil penalty as set forth in section 1-9(d) of the City Code shall be assessed to any user for each day that a report required by this article, a permit or order issued hereunder is late, beginning five days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by the director to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the director's authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late reporting violations. 
(b)  Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(c)  Liability insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge or a general permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(d)  Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder. 
(e)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(f)  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code section 15-6 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(g)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements shall constitute grounds for termination of an existing contract with the user and debarment of the user from doing any further business with the city as set forth in the City Code. (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 1573-315, § 2, 3-16-15) 
24-114 - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) below are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(A)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(B)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in accordance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(C)  The user has submitted the following information to the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) calendar days): 
(i)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in sections 24-103(a)(1) and 24-103(a)(2)(C) through 24-103(a)(2)(G) of this article if the user can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limits exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the user was regularly in compliance with its AZPDES Permits, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
(A)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(B)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause noncompliance with any applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  A user shall notify the director of any bypass as follows: 
(A)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(B)  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) calendar days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated duration of time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(A)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(B)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(C)  The user submitted notices as required under section 24-114(c)(3) of this section. 
(5)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in section 24-114(c)(4)(A). (Ord. No. 1406-410, § 2, 4-19-10) 
24-115 - [Reserved]. 
Division 4. - Rates and Charges 

24-116 - Sewer service charges. 
(a)  There is hereby levied on each sewage system user having any sewer connection with the sewage system of the city or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial waste, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly in the city's sewage system, a sewer service charge. Subject to the exceptions provided in this chapter, such charge shall be based upon the estimated cost of sewage treatment apportioned to users or user classes based upon volume and strength characteristics of user contributions to the city's sewage system. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, the determination of volume and strength characteristics shall be as follows: 
(1)  Volume shall be based upon the quantity of water used in or on the premises as measured by a water or sewage meter or meters approved by the city, adjusted by the return factor for the appropriate user class as assigned by the city. 
(2)  Strength characteristics shall be based on the average B.O.D. and suspended solids for each user class. 
Additional charges for extra strength sewage, toxic pollutants, and sewage monitoring will be levied where applicable. 
(c)  Sewer service rate. The sewer service rates shall be established in amounts determined by the city council as part of the city's annual budget or by separate resolution. 
(d)  Users Not Otherwise Classified. Sewage discharged to the sewage system from commercial or industrial users not included in the schedule of wastewater rates shall be subject to charges calculated based on one hundred (100) percent of metered water use, except as otherwise provided, in accordance with the following formula: 
Wastewater Charge = CC + Vs[(Bc x 0.00834 x Bm) + (Sc x 0.00834 x Sm)] 
Where: 
Bc = Cost of treatment per unit of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) 
Bm = Concentration of BOD in milligrams per liter 
CC = Customer charge per bill 
Sc = Cost of treatment per unit of Suspended Solids (SS) 
Sm = Concentration of SS in milligrams per liter 
Vs = Volume of sewage in thousands of gallons 
(e)  Monitoring charge. When federal, state or city regulations require monitoring of the sewage from a commercial or industrial user whether for strength calculations or for N.P.D.E.S. compliance, that user shall pay a monitoring charge. The monitoring charge shall consist of all costs for personnel, material and equipment used to collect and analyze samples from the user's sewage. The exact charge shall be based on actual costs and shall be as determined by the city. 
(f)  Toxic pollutant charge. Any user who discharges any toxic pollutants that cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge from the city's sewage treatment system shall pay for such increased costs. 
(g)  Inconsistent agreement.

24-125 - Determination of amount of use. 
    The amount of sewage discharged to the sewage system of the city shall be determined by the quantity of water metered to the user. 
    If a commercial or industrial user desires to establish eligibility for a sewage service volume base of less than one hundred (100) percent of monthly water usage he may at his sole expense: 
(a)  Install a sewage meter acceptable to the city to measure the volume of liquid actually discharged into the sewage system from his premises. Such meter shall be maintained and calibrated by the user and the readings from the meter shall be taken at least twice weekly and shall be provided to the city on a monthly basis. In the event a sewage meter is installed, the rate schedule as set forth in section 24-116 shall be applied to: 
(1)  The volume of sewage entering the sewage system as measured by the meter each month; or 
(2)  A calculated volume based on the percentage of metered water usage discharged to the sewage system as determined by the historical comparison of water usage and metered sewage. 
(b)  In lieu of a sewage meter, that user may install auxiliary water meter(s) to measure the portion of water used which is diverted from entering the sewage system. In the event an auxiliary water meter is installed the volume of water metered by such meter(s) shall be deducted from the total volume of water usage before the sewer service rate schedule is applied. 
(c)  Commercial laundries and laundromats will be charged a volume factor of seventy (70) percent of metered water usage. 
    After the end of one (1) year after adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, no refunds, allowances or reductions from the one hundred (100) percent water use base will be granted commercial or industrial users for any time period prior to approval of a sewage metering or diverted water metering system.

24-126 - Determination of extra strength. 
    The city will perform analysis at intervals no greater than twelve (12) months to determine the strength of sewage discharged by commercial and industrial users who discharge an annual average volume of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons or more of sewage per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges. Industrial and commercial users who discharge an average of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges shall have their wastes analyzed as often as deemed necessary by the city to obtain representative samples. 
    If any industrial or commercial user chooses not to accept the analytical determination made by the city they may at their sole expense employ an independent laboratory, acceptable to the city, to conduct sampling and analysis of their sewage. The time period and location for the collection of the samples shall be designated by the city. The city and the independent laboratory shall both preside over the collection of the samples and shall equally divide the final composite so that duplicate analysis may be made. 
    If results of the analysis of the sewage sample made by both the city and independent laboratory are not comparable, the city may appoint a second independent laboratory to analyze the sewage. The sampling procedures used will be the same as those outlined above. The results of these analysis, together with the previous results shall be used to determine the actual extra strength charges. The fee for the second independent laboratory analysis shall be shared equally between the city and the user. 
    If any industrial or commercial user improves the quality of their discharge sewage, the city will reevaluate the strength of the sewage if requested to do so by the user. The user will pay an additional monitoring charge for the necessary sampling and analysis. 
    The city shall have the right to enter upon all premises served by the sewage system of the city, for the purpose of inspecting, reading or otherwise examining all meters and appurtenances involved in the recording of water received on the premises or sewage discharged therefrom, or to collect samples for analysis of sewage discharged therefrom.

    The procurement agent or authorized designee may require a bid or proposal bond/guarantee be submitted with any and all bids or proposals, and performance and payment bonds be submitted prior to execution of any contract. The procurement agent or authorized designee may waive the bid or proposal bond/guarantee requirement if he/she finds that the requirement will have a significant negative impact on the ability of disadvantaged business enterprises to compete for city purchases or if by clear and convincing evidence that such waiver is in the best interest of the city. (Ord. No. 1166-206, § 2, 2-6-06) 
25-16 - Confidential information. 
(a)  If a person believes that a bid, proposal, offer, or specification contains information that should be withheld from public disclosure, a statement advising the procurement agent or authorized designee of this fact and the basis for exemption from such disclosure shall accompany this submission and the information shall be specifically identified wherever it appears. 
(b)  The procurement agent or authorized designee shall make a determination whether the information shall be subject to public disclosure and shall advise in writing the party submitting the information of the final determination. 
(c)  All information contained in the proposals shall be deemed as exempt from public disclosure based on the city's need to avoid disclosure of contents prejudicial to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. The proposals shall not be open for public inspection until after contract award. Except to the extent the offeror designates, and the city concurs, trade secrets or other proprietary data contained in the proposal shall remain exempt from public disclosure to the extent permitted by law. (Ord. No. 1166-206, § 2, 2-6-06) 
25-17 - Invitation for bids.

(b)  An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. 
(c)  Bids shall be by sealed proposals only and under such regulations as may be prescribed by the procurement agent or authorized designee. The procurement agent or authorized designee shall have the power to reject any or all bids, and advertise for bids again. 
(d)  Adequate public notice of the invitation for bid shall be given in the same manner as provided in section 25-13 above. 
(e)  Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the procurement agent or authorized designee deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder, shall be recorded; the record of bids shall be open to public inspection immediately, but individual bids shall be open to public inspection only after the contract is awarded. 
(f)  Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized by this procurement code. Bids shall be evaluated based upon the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not set forth in the invitation for bids. 
(g)  Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate at the city's sole discretion. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake and the bid price actually intended. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid in the sole discretion of the city and only if: 
(1)  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correction bid is not similarly evident; or 
(2)  The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel award or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the procurement agent or authorized designee. 
(h)  The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The amount of applicable transaction privilege or use tax of the city shall not be a factor in determining the net lowest. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a construction project exceeds available funds as certified by the procurement agent or authorized designee, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five (5) percent, the procurement agent or authorized designee is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Any such negotiated adjustment shall be based only upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for bids. 
(i)  When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(j)  All vendors and contractors must be in compliance, at the time set for opening the bid, with all applicable (i) state, federal and county laws, rules and regulations and (ii) city codes, ordinances and regulations. (Ord. No. 1166-206, § 2, 2-6-06)

(b)  Proposals shall be solicited through a written request for proposals. 
(c)  Proposals shall be submitted at the time and place designated in the request for proposals. 
(d)  As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible to being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and before the award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing proposers. 
(e)  The award shall be made to the responsible and responsive offeror whose proposal is determined, in writing, to be the most advantageous to the city and best meets the overall needs of the city taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals; no other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation other than as set forth in the request for proposals. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors; specific numerical weighing is not required. The amount of applicable transaction privilege or use tax of the city shall not be a factor in determining the most advantageous proposal. 
(f)  The contract file shall contain the basis upon which the award is made. 
(g)  All vendors and contractors must be in compliance, at the time set for opening the proposal, with all applicable (i) state, federal and county laws, rules and regulations and (ii) City codes, ordinances and regulations. (Ord. No. 1166-206, § 2, 2-6-06)

(6)  For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area, the utilization of those capital facilities by existing service units, and the available excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new service units including any existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity. The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally identify any changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service units, or to meet new safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for services provided to existing service units. 
(7)  Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the need for necessary public services in each affected service area. 
(8)  Estimate the total number of existing and future service units within each service area based on the city's land use assumptions. 
(9)  Based on the analysis in subsections 26-7(a)(3)-(6) above, provide a summary table or tables describing the level of service for each category of necessary public services by relating the required capital facilities to service units in each service area, and identifying the applicable service unit factor associated with each category of development. 
(10)  For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service area as a result of the new projected service units in that service area, for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the city from additionally including in its infrastructure improvements plan projected utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than ten years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the development fee calculation. 
(11)  For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities that will be required to serve new service units, including costs of land acquisition, improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for replacement of capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve existing service units. If the infrastructure improvements plan includes changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service units, or to meet new regulatory requirements for services provided to existing service units, such costs shall be identified and distinguished in the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(12)  Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, which shall include estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based on the approved land use assumptions. The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and implement the new or expanded capital facilities. 
(13)  Calculate required offsets as follows: 
a.  From the forecasted revenues in subsection 26-7(a)(12) above, identify those sources of revenue that: (i) are attributable to new development, and (ii) will contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services. 
b.  For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to subsection 26-7(a)(13)a. above, calculate the relative contribution of each category of development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in each service area. 
c.  Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to subsection 26-7(a)(13)b. above, for each category of necessary public services, calculate the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service area. 
d.  For each category of necessary public services, convert the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service area into an offset amount per service unit by dividing the total offset for each category of development by the number of service units associated with that category of development. 
e.  Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the required offset, if the city imposes a construction, contracting, or similar excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax classifications in the city, the entire excess portion of the construction, contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless the excess portion is already taken into account for such purpose pursuant to this section. 
f.  In determining the amount of required offset for land included in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 4, Article 6, the city shall take into account any capital facilities provided by the district that are included in the infrastructure improvements plan and the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district proportionally. 
(b)  Multiple plans. An infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to this subsection may address one or more of the city's categories of necessary public services in any or all of the city's service areas. Each capital facility shall be subject to no more than one infrastructure improvements plan at any given time. 
(c)  Reserved capacity. The city may reserve capacity in an infrastructure improvements plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to section 26-12 of this chapter. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the infrastructure improvements plan at the time it is adopted. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-8 - Adoption and modification procedures. 
(a)  Adopting or amending the infrastructure improvements plan. The infrastructure improvements plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the following procedures: 
(1)  Major amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the adoption or amendment of an infrastructure improvement plan shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule, and may occur concurrently with the adoption of an update of the city's land use assumptions as provided in section 26-6 of this chapter: 
a.  Sixty (60) days before the first public hearing regarding a new or updated infrastructure improvements plan, the city shall provide public notice of the hearing and post the infrastructure improvements plan and the underlying land use assumptions on its website; the city shall additionally make available to the public the documents used to prepare the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions and any proposed changes to capital facilities. 
b.  The city shall conduct a public hearing on the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions at least thirty (30) days, but no more than sixty (60) days, before approving or disapproving the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(2)  Minor amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the city may update the infrastructure improvements plan and/or its underlying land use assumptions without a public hearing if all of the following apply: 
a.  The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions will not add any new category of necessary public services to any service area. 
b.  The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions will not increase the level of service to be provided in any service area. 
c.  Based on an analysis of the fee report and the city's adopted development impact fee schedules, the changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this subsection, have caused a development impact fee in any service area to have been increased by more than five (5) percent above the development impact fee that is provided in the current development impact fee schedule. 
d.  At least thirty (30) days prior to the date that any amendment pursuant to this section is adopted, the city shall post the proposed amendments on the city website. 
(b)  Amendments to the fee report. Any adoption or amendment of a fee report and fee schedule shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule: 
(1)  The first public hearing on the fee report must be held at least thirty (30) days after the adoption or approval of and infrastructure improvements plan as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The city must give at least thirty (30) days notice prior to the hearing, provided that this notice may be given on the same day as the approval or disapproval of the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(2)  The city shall make the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions available to the public on the city's website thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing described in subsection 26-8(b)(1) above. 
(3)  The fee report may be adopted by the city no sooner than thirty (30) days, and no later than sixty (60) days, after the hearing described in subsection 26-8(b)(1) above. 
(4)  The development fee schedules in the fee report adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective as set forth in A.R.S. § 9-463.05. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-9 - Timing for the renewal and updating of the infrastructure improvements plan and the land use assumptions. 
(a)  Renewing the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, not later than every five (5) years the city shall update the applicable infrastructure improvements plan and fee report related to each category of necessary public services pursuant to section 26-8 of this chapter. Such five-year period shall be calculated from the date of the adoption of the infrastructure improvements plan or the date of the adoption of the fee report, whichever occurs later. 
(b)  Determination of no changes. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if the city determines that no changes to an infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, or fee report are needed, the city may elect to continue the existing infrastructure improvements plan and fee report without amendment by providing notice as follows: 
(1)  Notice of the determination shall be published at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the five-year period described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(2)  The notice shall identify the infrastructure improvements plan and fee report that shall continue in force without amendment. 
(3)  The notice shall provide a map and description of the service area(s) covered by such infrastructure improvements plan and fee report. 
(4)  The notice shall identify an address to which any resident of the city may submit, within sixty (60) days, a written request that the city update the infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, and/or fee report and the reasons and basis for the request. 
(c)  Response to comments. The city shall consider and respond to any timely requests submitted pursuant to subsection 26-9(b)(4) above. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-10 - Collection of development impact fees. 
(a)  Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative charges assessed pursuant to subsection 26-10(a)(6) below, shall be calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence development; specifically: 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement adopted pursuant to section 26-12 of this chapter, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit according to the current development impact fee schedule for the applicable service area(s) as adopted pursuant to this chapter, or according to any other development impact fee schedule as authorized in this chapter. 
(2)  If a building permit is not required for the development, but water or wastewater connections are required, any and all development impact fees due shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a wastewater connection is required, the development impact fees shall be paid prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system. Wastewater development impact fees shall be assessed if a development connects to the public sewer, or as determined by the city manager or authorized designee, is capable of discharging sewage to a city public sewer. 
(3)  If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater, drainage, and flood control development impact fee, and neither a building permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage development impact fee due shall be paid at the time any permit is issued for the development. 
(4)  No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed in the previous subsections. 
(5)  If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use, an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a residential or non-residential point of demand to the water or wastewater system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type. 
(6)  For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact fees and administrative charges shall be as follows: 
a.  If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed. 
b.  If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it were the original permittee. 
(b)  Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of the following conditions: 
(1)  Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development impact fees have not expired or been voided. 
(2)  The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential development that do not: (a) add new service units, (b) increase the impact of existing service units on existing or future capital facilities, or (c) change the land-use type of the existing development to a different category of development for which a higher development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements of this paragraph, the development impact fee due shall be the difference between the development impact fee that was or would have been due on the existing development and the development impact fee that is due on the development as modified. 
(c)  Temporary freezing of development impact fee schedules. New developments in the city shall be temporarily exempt from increases in development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified development impact fee schedules as follows: 
(1)  On or after the day that the first building permit is issued for a single-family residential development, the city shall, at the permittee's request, provide the permittee with an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of twenty-four (24) months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, the developer shall pay the fees on that schedule, and any building permit issued for the same single-family residential development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule. 
(2)  On or after the day that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a commercial, industrial or multifamily development, the city shall provide an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of twenty-four (24) months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule. 
(3)  Any category of development not covered under subsections 26-10(c)(1) and (2) above shall pay development impact fees according to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in subsection 26-10(a) above. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subsection, if changes are made to a development's final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service units after the issuance of a development impact fee schedule issued pursuant to this subsection 26-10(c) above, the city may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the additional service units. If the city reduces the amount of an applicable development impact fee during the period that a development impact fee schedule issued pursuant to this subsection 26-10(c) above is in force, the city shall assess the lower development impact fee. 
(d)  Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated with providing necessary public services to that development will differ substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified category of development, the city may require the applicant to provide the city manager or authorized designee with an alternative development impact fee analysis. Based on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with the development, the alternative development impact fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development based on the application of an appropriate service unit factor, or may propose that the development be covered under the development impact fee schedule governing a different and more analogous category of development. The city manager or authorized designee shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a determination as to the development impact fee to be charged. Such decision shall be appealable pursuant to section 26-13 of this chapter. The city manager or authorized designee may require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-11 - Development impact fee credits and credit agreements. 
(a)  Eligibility of capital facility. All development impact fee credits must meet the following requirements: 
(1)  One of the following is true: 
a.  The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit will be issued, must be identified in an adopted infrastructure improvements plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee was assessed; or 
b.  The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility should have been included in the infrastructure improvements plan in lieu of a different capital facility that was included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the city shall amend the infrastructure improvements plan to (i) include the subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the capital facility that will be replaced. 
(2)  Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by the city through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the developer will be paid or reimbursed by the city for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication from any city funding source including an agreement to reimburse the developer with future-collected development impact fees pursuant to section 26-12 of this chapter, any credits claimed by the developer shall be: (a) deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the city; or (b) reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement. 
(b)  Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible capital facility. 
(c)  Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted infrastructure improvements plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary public service is adopted at an amount lower than the maximum amount justified by the fee report, the amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between the maximum amount justified by the fee report, and the gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible capital facility. 
(d)  Credit allocation. Before any credit can be issued to a subject development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that development as follows: 
(1)  The developer and the city must execute a credit agreement including all of the following: 
a.  The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an eligible capital facility. 
b.  The estimated number of service units to be served within the subject development. 
c.  The method by which the credit values will be distributed within the subject development. 
(2)  It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of development impact fee credits through an application for a credit agreement (which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to section 26-12 of this chapter). 
(3)  If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter. 
(4)  If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s) in interest for the subject development. 
(5)  If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility, all entities must enter into a single credit agreement with the city, and any request for the allocation of credit within the subject development(s) must be made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible capital facility. 
(6)  Credits may only be reallocated from or within a subject development with the city's approval of an amendment to an executed credit agreement, subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The entity that executed the original agreement with the city, or its legal successor in interest and the entity that currently controls the subject development are parties to the request for reallocation. 
b.  The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any credits already issued for the subject development. 
(7)  A credit agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The entity that executed the original agreement with the city or its legal successor in interest, the entity that currently controls the subject development, and the entity that controls the non-contiguous parcel are parties to the request for reallocation. 
b.  The reallocation proposal does not change the value of any credits already issued for the subject development. 
c.  The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that served by the eligible capital facility. 
d.  The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from the eligible capital facility. 
e.  The credit agreement specifically states the value of the credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or service unit, or establishes a mechanism for future determination of the credit values. 
f.  The credit agreement does not involve the transfer of credits to or from any property subject to a development agreement. 
(e)  Credit agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a credit agreement executed in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The city manager or authorized designee is authorized by this chapter to enter into a credit agreement with the controlling entity of a subject development, subject to the following: 
(1)  The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all information requested by the city to allow it to determine the value of the credit to be applied. 
(2)  An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the city by the developer within one year of the date on which ownership or control of the capital facility passes to the city. 
(3)  The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the city manager or authorized designee(s) for review in the form provided to the applicant by the city. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the following information and supporting documentation: 
a.  A legal description and map depicting the location of the subject development for which credit is being applied. The map shall depict the location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided. 
b.  An estimate of the total service units that will be developed within the subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal description. 
c.  A list of the capital facilities, associated physical attributes, and the related costs as stated in the infrastructure improvements plan. 
d.  Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the city, if the capital facilities have already been provided. 
e.  The total amount of credit to be applied within the subject development and the calculations leading to the total amount of credit. 
f.  The credit amount to be applied to each service unit within the subject development for each category of necessary public services. 
(4)  The city's determination of the credit to be allocated is final. 
(5)  Upon execution of the credit agreement by the city and the applicant, credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development. 
(6)  Any amendment to a previously-approved credit agreement must be initiated within two years of the city's final acceptance of the eligible capital facility for which the amendment is requested. 
(7)  Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and section 26-12 of this chapter. 
(f)  Credit issuance. Credits allocated pursuant to subsection 26-11(d) above may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due from a development, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of necessary public services. 
(2)  Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility from which the credits were derived has been accepted by the city or when adequate security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been provided in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement. 
(3)  Where credits have been issued pursuant to subsection 26-11(f)(2) above, an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be reduced by the credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed credit agreement. Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee shall be paid in full, and a refund of the credit amount shall be due when the developer demonstrates compliance with subsection 26-11(f)(2) above in a written request to the city. 
(4)  Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to another permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the same subject development if a building permit for which the credits were issued has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under subsection 26-14(a)(2)a. below. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 26-11, credits issued prior to January 1, 2012, may only be used for the subject development for which they were issued. Such credits may be transferred to a new owner of all or part of the subject development in proportion to the percentage of ownership in the subject development to be held by the new owner. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-12 - Development agreements. 
    Development agreements containing provisions regarding development impact fees, development impact fee credits, and/or disbursement of revenues from development impact fee accounts shall comply with the following: 
(a)  Development agreement required. A development agreement is required to authorize any of the following: 
(1)  To issue credits prior to the city's acceptance of an eligible capital facility. 
(2)  To allocate credits to a parcel that is not contiguous with the subject development and that does not meet the requirements of subsection 26-11(d)(7) above. 
(3)  To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using funds from development impact fee accounts. 
(4)  To allocate different credit amounts per service unit to different parcels within a subject development. 
(5)  For a single family residential dwelling unit, to allow development impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit as provided in this section. 
(b)  General requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and executed in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements of the City Code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all provisions of section 26-11 of this chapter shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a development agreement. 
(c)  Early credit issuance. A development agreement may authorize credit issuance prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the city when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of the security (i.e. bond, letter of credit, etc.) to be provided to the city prior to credit issuance. The city attorney shall determine the acceptable form and value of the security to be provided. 
(d)  Non-contiguous credit allocation. A development agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a non-contiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The non-contiguous parcel is in the same service area as that served by the eligible capital facility. 
(2)  The non-contiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from the eligible capital facility. 
(3)  The development agreement specifically states the value of the credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or service unit, or establishes a mechanism for future determination of the credit values. 
(e)  Uneven credit allocation. If the credits are not to be allocated evenly, the development agreement must specify how credits will be allocated amongst different parcels on a per-service unit basis. If the development agreement is silent on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels on a per-service unit basis. 
(f)  Use of reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in accordance with applicable law for the use of city funds in construction or acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. § 34-201, et seq. 
(g)  Deferral of fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral of payment of development impact fees for a single-family residential development beyond the issuance of a building permit; provided that a development impact fee may not be paid later than fifteen (15) days after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for the value of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond. 
(h)  Waiver of fees. If the city agrees to waive any development impact fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the city shall reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that was waived. 
(i)  No obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the city to enter into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement permitted by this section. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-13 - Appeals. 
    A development impact fee determination by city staff may be appealed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(a)  Limited scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the calculation of the development impact fees for a specific development and/or permit and calculation of service units for the development. 
(b)  Form of appeal. An appeal shall be initiated in such written form as the city may prescribe, and submitted to the city manager or authorized designee. 
(c)  Timing of appeal to manager. The applicant may appeal the calculation to the city manager or authorized designee within thirty (30) calendar days of the calculation. 
(d)  Action by manager. The city manager or authorized designee shall act upon the appeal within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the appeal, and the applicant shall be notified of the city manager or authorized designee's decision in writing. 
(e)  Final decision. The city manager or authorized designee's decision regarding the appeal is final. 
(f)  Fees during pendency. Building permits may be issued during the pendency of an appeal if the applicant (1) pays the full impact fee calculated by the city at the time the appeal is filed or (2) provides the city with financial assurances in the form acceptable to the city attorney equal to the full amount of the impact fee. Upon final disposition of an appeal, the fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered, and a refund paid if warranted. If the appeal is denied by the city manager or authorized designee, and the applicant has provided the city with financial assurances as set forth in clause (2) in this paragraph, the applicant shall deliver the full amount of the impact fee to the city within ten (10) days of the city manager or designee's final decision on the appeal. If the applicant fails to deliver the full amount of the impact fees when required by this subsection, the city may draw upon such financial assurance instrument(s) as necessary to recover the full amount of the impact fees due from the applicant. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-14 - Refunds of development impact fees. 
(a)  Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current owner of property within the city who submits a written request to the city and demonstrates that: 
(1)  The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of financing or debt; or 
(2)  The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists: 
a.  The capital facility designed to serve the subject real property has been constructed, has the capacity to serve the subject real property and any development for which there is reserved capacity, and the service which was to be provided by that capital facility has not been provided to the subject real property from that capital facility or from any other infrastructure. 
b.  After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the city fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, as it may be amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure. 
c.  For a category of necessary public services other than water or wastewater facilities, any part of a development impact fee is not spent within ten (10) years of the city's receipt of the development impact fee. For the purpose of determining whether fees have been spent, the city shall use a first-in, first-out process. 
d.  Any part of a development impact fee for water or wastewater facilities is not spent within fifteen (15) years of the city's receipt of the development impact fee. For the purpose of determining whether fees have been spent, the city shall use a first-in, first-out process. 
e.  The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of ten (10) percent or more. In such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in this subsection (a), be entitled to a refund for the difference between the amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee report. The refund contemplated by this subsection shall relate only to the costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05. 
(b)  Earned interest. A refund of a development impact fee shall include any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development impact fee by the city from the date of collection to the date of refund; provided, however that interest is not required to be paid if the refund is requested by the developer or property owner due to voluntary cessation or abandonment of work. All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid. 
(c)  Refund to government. If a development impact fee was paid by a governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity. 
(d)  Time limitation. Any refund request must be made not later than one hundred eighty (180) days following the occurrence of any event described in subsections 26-14(a)(2)a.-e. above. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14) 
26-15 - Oversight of development impact fee program. 
(a)  Annual report. Within ninety (90) days of the end of each fiscal year, the city shall file with the city clerk an unaudited annual report accounting for the collection and use of the fees for each service area and shall post the report on its website in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05(N) and (O), as amended. 
(b)  Biennial audit. In addition to the annual report described in subsection 7-10-15(a) above, the city shall provide for a biennial, certified audit of the city's land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development impact fees. 
(1)  An audit pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted by one or more qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the city and who did not prepare the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(2)  The audit shall review the collection and expenditures of development fees for each project in the plan and provide written comments describing the amount of development impact fees assessed, collected, and spent on capital facilities. 
(3)  The audit shall describe the level of service in each service area, and evaluate any inequities in implementing the infrastructure improvements plan or imposing the development impact fee. 
(4)  The city shall post the findings of the audit on the city's website and shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within sixty (60) days of the release of the audit to the public. 
(5)  For purposes of this section, a certified audit shall mean any audit authenticated by one or more of the qualified professionals conducting the audit pursuant to subsection 26-15(b)(1) above. (Ord. No. 1551-614, § 2, 6-16-14)

F. Non-conforming Buildings, Structures and Uses
This Article provides for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses. These regulations are designed to protect the rights of legally existing nonconforming uses, structures and buildings, but not to promote expansion or enlargement of such uses.
1. Non-conforming Buildings and Structures:
Any building or structure that lawfully exists on the effective date of this Ordinance or amendments hereto, but which could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance because it does not meet lot coverage, height, setback or other development standards required of the zone in which it is located shall be considered a non-conforming building/structure and is subject to the regulations of this subsection 101(F). No structural or physical alteration shall be made to any non-conforming building or structure except as follows:
a. Routine repairs or maintenance of non-conforming buildings or structures shall be allowed.
b. A non-conforming building or structure that has been damaged by fire, flood or other calamity, may be reconstructed if such reconstruction is completed within twelve (12) months of such calamity. The Zoning Administrator may extend the twelve (12) month deadline if a delay in reconstruction was shown to be caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the premises.
c. Additions to non-conforming buildings or structures shall only be permitted if the added portion of the building or structure conforms to all development standards specified for the district in which it is located, except that;
i. Non-conforming single-family dwellings may be expanded into required setbacks so long as the expansion does not encroach further into the required setback than the existing building.
ii. Single-Family dwellings that are non-conforming because they do not meet current parking requirements may be expanded so long as the expansion meets current development standards for the district in which it is located.
2. Non-conforming Uses:
Any use of a building, a structure, or land that lawfully exists on the effective date of this Ordinance or amendments hereto, but which could not commence under the terms of this Ordinance because of restrictions on the use of a building, a structure or land in the zone in which it is located shall be considered a non-conforming use and is subject to the regulations of this Section. A non-conforming use shall be allowed to continue operating in the manner it existed at the time it became non-conforming, subject to the following:
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 1, Administration and Procedures
2932975.12
7
a. A non-conforming use shall not be expanded into additional building area or land area, even if the building area is allowed to be expanded as set forth in this subsection 101(F).
b. Whenever a non-conforming use has been discontinued or abandoned for a period of one (1) year, such use shall not thereafter be re-established and any future uses shall be in conformity with the provisions of the zone in which the property is located. Once changed to a conforming use, no building, structure, or land shall be permitted to revert back to a non-conforming use.
c. A non-conforming use that is forced to cease operations due to fire, flood or other calamity, may recommence within twelve (12) months of such calamity. The Zoning Administrator may extend the twelve (12) month deadline if a delay in recommencing was shown to be caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the premises.
102 Enforcement
Any person violating the provisions of this Ordinance shall be subject to civil and criminal penalties. The owners, occupants, and authorized agents of property in violation of this Ordinance may be held individually and jointly responsible for the violation, the prescribed civil and criminal penalties and for abating the violation. Each day a violation of this Ordinance continues shall constitute a separate civil or criminal offense unless such violation involves a billboard, as defined by this Ordinance, in which case the provisions of ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 9-462.02, as amended, shall apply. The procedures and remedies provided in this Ordinance shall be cumulative and in addition to any other procedures and remedies to which the City may otherwise be entitled by law. Any violation of this Ordinance is declared to be a public nuisance, and instead of, or in addition to, any civil or criminal enforcement measure authorized by this Ordinance, may be enjoined or restrained by the City as other nuisances are abated under authority of the City Charter and applicable State law.
A. Evidence of Identity; Penalty for Failure to Provide
A person who fails or refuses to provide evidence of his or her identity to a duly authorized agent of the City upon request, when such agent has reasonable cause to believe the person has committed a violation of this Ordinance, is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. Evidence of identity shall consist of a persons full name, residence address and date of birth.

5. Failure of the responsible party, property owner, occupant, manager, or authorized agent of the property owner to receive a notice of violation shall not preclude the subsequent issuance of a civil citation or criminal complaint, as applicable.
6. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the City from taking immediate action to protect the public from an imminent hazard to health or safety as otherwise provided by law.
C. Civil Citations
1. If a violation continues past the time provided for voluntary compliance, a civil citation may be issued to the person responsible for the violation.

SECTION 2
SECTION 2 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTSRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
201 Purpose
The residential districts are designed to promote high quality neighborhoods that have a distinct character, superior aesthetics, desirable amenities, open space and landscaping to meet the needs and expectations of the Citys residents. The Districts range from low to high density, with distinct lists of allowed uses, development regulations and design requirements. These regulations are intended to further the intent and policies of the Citys General Plan and to promote the health, safety and welfare of the Citys citizens and visitors.
It is the intent of this ordinance to group similar or compatible land uses into specific zoning districts, either as permitted uses, uses permitted with conditions, or as uses authorized by a conditional use permit. Uses not listed as a permitted, permitted with conditions, or conditional use shall be prohibited from the applicable zoning district. In the event a particular use is not listed in this Section and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall determine whether such unlisted use is analogous to other listed uses; the determination shall be made pursuant to Section 105 of this Ordinance. The residential districts are grouped into six (6) categories, each with a specific purpose, as follows:
A. Agricultural - Agricultural (AG) Zoning District. The purpose of the Agricultural (AG) Zoning District is to allow agricultural, ranching and related uses within the City. The District also serves as a holding zoning for land until suitable for rezoning and development.
B. Rural Residential - RR-43 and RR-18 Zoning Districts. The purpose of the RR-43 Zoning District is to encourage and preserve low-density residential developments with low intensity agricultural operations in a growing area. The purpose of the RR-18 district is to encourage Single-Family Residential uses and provide a semi-rural character that includes the keeping of farm animals. The intent of the district is to provide an appropriate buffer between urban and agricultural lifestyles with livestock and animal provisions while fostering orderly growth and limiting nonresidential land uses to maintain a rural residential character.
C. Suburban Residential - R1-35, R1-15, R1-10, and R1-8 Zoning Districts. The purpose of these districts is to provide low-density, estate-type residential uses. The districts serve as a transition between agricultural uses and urban development.
D. Urban Residential  R1-7, R1-6 and R1-5 Zoning Districts. The purpose of these districts is to provide a variety of single-family detached residential dwelling types at an urban density.
E. Multi-Family Residential  R-2, R-3, and R-4 Zoning Districts.
1. The R-2 Zoning District is intended to provide a transition from Single-Family Residential neighborhoods to a mixture of higher intensity land uses. Properties in this district are intended to be developed as single-family detached and attached, townhomes and patio homes.
2. The R-3 Zoning District is intended to provide for townhome, condominium and apartment uses.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 2, Residential Districts
2932975.12
63
3. The R-4 Zoning District is intended to be located near high activity commercial areas of the City and providing for high intensity townhome, condominium, apartment, and loft apartments.
F. Manufactured Home Park - MH Zoning District. The purpose of the MH Zoning District is to provide an alternative living style and dwelling type to conventional single-family and multi-family housing. Standards contained herein are designed to afford adequate separation of manufactured home units, screening and open space in order to enhance the park environment.

307 Old Town Avondale Business District (OTAB)
A. Purpose
The purpose of the Old Town Avondale Business District (OTAB) is to further the revitalization of the Citys original town site and its immediate vicinity by encouraging pedestrian-oriented development and by emphasizing a unique mix of uses intended to make Old Town a destination, with street level activity that takes one back to an earlier place in Avondales history.
The district shall enhance and maintain the character of retail and residential living by encouraging an active pedestrian environment while also promoting vitality throughout the district. To accomplish the task of making OTAB pedestrian friendly, the district requires new structures to be designed at a human scale to preserve the residential and historical character of the neighborhood. Development occurring in the district shall be designed to reduce conflicts between pedestrians and vehicular traffic and to promote primary areas of concentrated indoor retail and service business uses, but not regional shopping centers.
The Old Town Avondale Business District is intended to:
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 3, Commercial Districts
2932975.12
94
1. Promote a healthy community by encouraging development and redevelopment of pedestrian-focused commercial businesses, such as those which encourage patrons to shop and dine for several hours without having to use their vehicles between stops.
2. Reduce the dominance of the automobile by encouraging the use of shared parking areas, such as on-street parking, public surface lots, and public parking structures.
3. Create a destination for unique retail, restaurant, entertainment and service uses that increase revenues and strengthen the Citys tax base, drawing consumers both locally and regionally.
4. Respect the local and cultural significance of the Citys original town site without hindering creativity in design.
5. Support limited commercial uses in residential structures located within the neighborhoods that are located in close proximity to Western Avenue.
6. Provide an environment where commerce can flourish in a traditional main street type of setting, with the knowledge that ample opportunity for suburban style development is available throughout the remainder of the City.
7. Create old-fashioned neighborhoods where a variety of housing types coexist alongside compatible commercial businesses.
B. Applicability
The location and boundaries of the OTAB District are established as shown on the map entitled Zoning Atlas, City of Avondale, Arizona, as amended, a copy of which is on file with the Department.
C. Sub-Districts
The OTAB District is comprised of the following sub-districts:
1. Heritage District.
Any property located within OTAB with direct frontage on Western Avenue, Central Avenue or Dysart Road shall be subject to the requirements, restrictions and standards that are listed in this subsection 307(C)(1). This Sub-District promotes pedestrian-oriented development that is designed to attract customers from a regional trade area as well as from the immediate area. Commercial uses are required on the ground floor in order to produce the critical mass of businesses necessary to make the area flourish; residential uses are encouraged on upper floors to create a presence in the area during off-peak business hours. Development shall take the form of a traditional main street, where businesses extend to the pedestrian sidewalk and parking is provided on the street, within public lots/structures, or behind the buildings.
2. Neighborhood District.
Any property located within OTAB with direct frontage on a local street shall be subject to the requirements, restrictions and standards that are listed in this subsection 307(C)(2) for the
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 3, Commercial Districts
2932975.12
95
Neighborhood District. This Sub-District is designed to provide a transition between the OTAB Heritage District and the residential districts located on the periphery of the OTAB Neighborhood District. Residential uses remain the primary land use; however, non-residential uses such as boutiques, cafes, professional offices and bed and breakfast inns are permitted. These commercial businesses may be located in either retrofitted residences or new buildings. Development standards have been designed to be respectful of the residential character of the district. Unlike the Heritage District, which requires buildings be placed at the edge of the sidewalk, landscaped areas are required in the fronts of businesses in this Sub-District in order to give entryways a sense of importance and to distinguish businesses from residential uses.

SECTION 5 SPECIAL DISTRICTSSPECIAL DISTRICTS; OVERLAYS; OVERLAYS
501 City Center District
A. Purpose
The Avondale City Center Specific Plan, as amended (the CCSP) was created to implement the City Councils vision of creating a high-density, mixed use environment that will become a premier destination for shopping, dining, entertainment, employment and various types of residential uses for the area of Avondale located between the Avondale Civic Center and Interstate Highway 10, commonly referred to as the City Center. The City Center Zoning District (the CCD) is intended to complete the vision expressed in the CCSP by prescribing building form, site design and architectural standards for the City Center. The CCD consists of two (2) components approved by the City Council: (A) a legislatively approved base zone, the boundaries of which are consistent with Figure 3-1 of the CCSP, containing the basic performance standards and regulations for the respective Sub-Districts shown on Figure 3-1 of the CCSP and (B) an administratively approved (by the City Council), individualized Development Plan that selects the land uses from those allowed in the base zone sub districts and organizes such uses into a form-based Development Plan specific to a site. Accordingly, the Sub-District categories set forth in Section 503 below are intended to directly relate to and implement the provisions set forth in Section 3.2 of the CCSP for the corresponding Sub-District category. The CCD is intended to be flexible to allow for a parcel of land to be entitled in a single step by combining the Development Plan with the base zone approval, much like a typical PAD rezoning, or to allow for the base zone to precede the Development Plan.
B. Applicability
1. Only properties within the City Center boundary will be permitted to rezone to the CCD.
2. The development regulations related to each Sub-District and the boundaries thereof shall correspond to the descriptions of the Land Use Categories of the same name in Section 3.2 of the CCSP and the boundaries and locations of the Land Use Categories as shown on Figure 3-1 of the CCSP.
C. Sub-Districts
The CCD is divided into six (6) Sub-Districts. Properties within each Sub-District shall comply with the Land Uses and Development Standards set forth in this Section in accordance with the standards in the CCSP for each such Sub-District. The six (6) Sub-Districts are described below:
1. Gateway Employment.
The Gateway Employment (GE) Sub-District is designed to place primary land uses close to the freeway, to maximize opportunities for business exposure to the freeway and to ensure that residential uses are not located within six hundred (600) feet of freeway traffic. Primary uses in Gateway Employment Sub-District include retail, office, and hotel. In this Sub-District, residential, industrial, manufacturing, and warehouse uses are not permitted. Uses may be served by surface and/or structured parking. Building heights shall not exceed ten (10) stories. However, a building may be built up to sixteen (16) stories with City Council
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
119
approval as part of the Development Plan process. A variety of Mid-rise and high-rise office, pedestrian-oriented retail, large floor plate uses and big box uses are permitted in the Gateway Employment Sub-District, subject to an appropriate Development Plan.
2. Employment Mixed-Use.
The Employment Mixed-Use (EMU) Sub-District is designed to emphasize employment uses, including retail, professional office, hotel, and personal service uses. Residential units may be built on upper floors throughout the Employment Mixed-Use Sub-District if built in conjunction with employment uses; provided, however, that residential units fronting on and/or adjacent to Park Avenue or 117th Avenue may be built on the ground floor. The minimum ratio is one (1) square foot of employment use for every two (2) square feet of residential development, except for those properties fronting Park Avenue or 117th Avenue south of Corporate Drive, which may be exclusively residential. The mix of uses may be provided horizontally or vertically, and may be distributed across multiple properties, subject to Development Plan approval. Residential units may be incorporated throughout the first floor when it can be shown that such units support and heighten the purpose of the district.
The Employment Mixed-Use Sub-District is intended to include mid-rise and high-rise buildings of three (3) to ten (10) stories, predominantly served by structured parking. For a development project east of Avondale Boulevard, containing multiple buildings, the minimum average height shall be two (2) stories and the minimum floor area ratio shall be 0.5 at build out of all uses approved as part of the Development Plan, provided that the target floor area ratio should be 0.75  1.0. For a development project west of Avondale Boulevard containing multiple buildings, the average height shall be two (2) stories measured across multiple properties within a Development Plan, and the minimum floor area ratio shall be 0.25 at build out of all uses approved as part of the Development Plan, unless otherwise approved by the City Council. Building heights shall not exceed ten (10) stories. However, a building may be built up to sixteen (16) stories along Avondale Boulevard north of Van Buren Street with City Council approval as part of the Development Plan process.
3. Pedestrian Retail.
The Pedestrian Retail (PR) Sub-District includes all properties with frontage along pedestrian retail streets, as shown on Figure 3-1 of the CCSP. The land uses on the ground floor of buildings in the Pedestrian Retail Sub-District shall be restricted to those types of active uses that create a lively street environment. Professional offices and residential uses are not permitted in these ground floor locations, but are permitted on upper floors; provided, however, that residential uses fronting Park Avenue are permitted on the ground floor.
The form of development shall be compact building footprints, with small street setbacks and wide sidewalks designed to facilitate pedestrian activity. Buildings with first floor restaurants shall include outdoor seating areas that do not conflict with pedestrian areas. For a development project containing multiple buildings, the minimum average height shall be two (2) stories and the minimum floor area ratio shall be 0.5 at build out of all uses approved as part of the Development Plan, provided that the target floor area ratio should be 0.75  1.0.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
120
4. Neighborhood Commercial.
The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Sub-District is designed to allow for a suburban-type of development on the fringe of the City Center area, while still contributing to the intent of the look and feel of the City Center. Buildings along arterial streets shall conform to specific setbacks to provide the intended streetscape for the City Center area, while buildings at the interior of a site may have larger street setbacks. Uses allowed in the Neighborhood Commercial Sub-District are retail, restaurant, office, and personal service. Residential is appropriate on upper floors of multi-story buildings and may be approved as part of a development project containing multiple buildings.
5. Residential Mixed-Use.
The Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) Sub-District is designed to provide a transition between the Employment Mixed Use areas and residential neighborhoods. While residential is the primary land use, small office, retail, and personal service uses may be located on the ground floor of multi-story buildings. Non-residential uses such as small office buildings or boutique hotels may be permitted. Such non-residential uses shall be compatible in scale with nearby residential development and shall not adversely impact the quiet enjoyment of residential uses. Parking shall be located underneath or behind the units. Residential uses shall be developed at a minimum of fifteen (15) units per acre, and a maximum of forty-five (45) units per acre. Building heights shall range from two (2) to five (5) stories.
6. Townhouse Residential.
The Townhouse Residential (TR) Sub-District is designed to provide a transition between the Residential Mixed-Use Sub-District and neighboring Single-Family Residential development. Townhouse residential units shall be attached units with separate individual entrances fronting a public street and private open space attached to the individual unit in the form of patios or balconies. Parking shall be either attached or located on the same lot. Townhouse residential development may include interlocking units, but may not include buildings with common stairways serving multiple units. The minimum density shall be twelve (12) units per acre and the maximum density shall not exceed twenty (20) units per acre. Building heights are two (2) to three (3) stories.
D. Administration
1. Establishment.
CCD base zoning may be established on property within the City Center according to the procedures outlined in Section 111 of this Zoning Ordinance. In addition to the approved CCD base zoning, a City Council-approved Development Plan is required prior to any application for a development permit within the City Center area.
a. Development Plans may be filed for all or part of the property zoned or to be zoned CCD. Development Plans shall be submitted in accordance with Section 107, Site Plan Review; provided, however that the Planning Commission shall review, and City Council shall review and approve, all Development Plans for properties zoned CCD.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
121
b. The ordinance approving the rezoning of a property to CCD shall indicate, both by narrative text and a map, the location and boundaries of the Sub-Districts that are included in the area to be rezoned.
2. Amendment.
The Zoning Administrator or designee shall determine whether a proposed amendment to an approved Development Plan is a Major or Minor Amendment. Major Amendments shall require City Council approval with a recommendation of the Planning Commission. Minor Amendments shall require administrative approval by the Zoning Administrator or designee only.
a. Major Amendment: Any one (1) of the following shall be considered a Major Amendment of a Development Plan:
i. A significant change in boundary lines of the development. Minor and technical adjustments to the boundary lines within the Development Plan are permitted without a Major Amendment so long as (i) the adjustments do not divide zoning Sub-Districts, (ii) the area affected by the boundary change does not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the total area subject to the Development Plan, (iii) the adjustments do not significantly alter the traffic or pedestrian circulation system for the Development Plan and (iv) in the reasonable opinion of the Zoning Administrator, the overall character of the Development Plan, if modified, will remain in substantial conformance with the CCSP and the Development Plan as originally approved. Any expansion or relocation of a boundary line not within the scope of this exception shall be considered a major amendment of the Development Plan. Such boundary line changes may also require an amendment to the CCSP prior to any City Council consideration of the change to the Development Plan.
ii. Any change that could have significant negative impact on uses adjoining the development.
iii. Any change that could have a significant impact on roadways adjacent or external to the development.
iv. Any change that could have a significant negative impact on the amount of parking required or provided by the development.
v. Any change to a phasing plan that could have a significant negative impact on adjacent or surrounding developments.
b. Minor Amendment: All amendments to a Development Plan not determined by the Zoning Administrator to be Major Amendments according to the criteria set forth in subsection (1) above shall be Minor Amendments.
E. Land Uses
Land uses for each Sub-District shall comply with the Land Use Matrix set forth below. Uses not listed as a permitted, permitted with conditions, or conditional use shall be prohibited from the
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
122
applicable zoning district. In the event a particular use is not listed in this Section and such use is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall determine whether such use is analogous to other listed uses; the determination shall be made pursuant to Section 105 of this Ordinance.

Parking for each land use shall be provided by a combination of on-street parking, off-street surface parking and parking structures based on the following:
1. A parking demand analysis prepared by a qualified parking or traffic consultant, a licensed architect, or civil engineer shall be submitted with each Development Plan. The parking demand analysis, as approved by the Zoning Administrator or designee, shall determine the number of parking spaces required for each use within the Development Plan.
2. The parking demand analysis shall analyze the needs of every proposed use in the Development Plan, using the Required Parking Schedule in Section 8 of the Zoning Ordinance as a starting point.
a. Provided parking shall not exceed the one hundred ten (110) percent of the number listed in the Parking Schedule.
b. Provided parking for a single use may be up to twenty (20) percent less than the amount required by the Parking Schedule based on the parking analysis.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
128
3. The amount of required parking may be reduced by up to fifty (50) percent where it can be determined that the peak requirements of the several occupancies occur at different times and where a shared parking operations plan, approved by the Zoning Administrator or designee, shows that this reduction in parking will not cause conflicts among nearby uses. Such a shared parking analysis may be based on:
a. Intermittent non-conflicting uses. When required parking reductions are predicted as a result of sharing between intermittent uses with non-conflicting parking demands (e.g. a nightclub and a bank), then the reduction can be considered.
b. Parking occupancy rates. When the parking reduction has been shown to be feasible by using the demand calculations as determined by an analysis of typical local parking demand.
c. Existing parking surveys. When a study of existing parking shows parking occupancy rates of morning, afternoon and evening peaks on all seven (7) days of the week. The seven (7) days of observation may take place over the span of two (2) consecutive, typical weeks. A combination of similar circumstances may be necessary to cover all the proposed land uses. The approximate square footages of the various land uses of the specimen projects shall be compared to the proposed project to allow the ratios of uses to be rated accordingly.
4. Off-street surface parking and parking structures counted towards the required parking shall be within four hundred (400) feet of the use, measured from the exterior wall of the use to the closest perimeter of the surface parking or parking structure.
5. On-street parking counted towards the required parking shall be adjacent to the property for which the parking is intended.
6. The EMU Sub-District west of Avondale Boulevard may include reduced parking space dimensions with a minimum size of nine and one-half (9.5) x eighteen (18) feet; additionally, a two (2) foot overhang may be counted towards the minimum parking space dimension if the overhang occurs over a landscape area with a depth of at least six (6) feet and if the overhang does not occur over a pedestrian sidewalk.
J. Necessary Amendments
In the event that any of the provisions of the CCSP referred to herein are amended, the Zoning Administrator shall concurrently give notice of and process an amendment to this Section 5, in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 111 of this Zoning Ordinance.

J. Architectural and Design Standards
1. Standards and Guidelines for Large-Scale Sports and Entertainment Venues.
The MSED recognizes the unique nature of large scale sports and entertainment venues and the ability of such facilities to create iconic facilities within a community. Therefore, typical design requirements like those specified in the Citys Design Manuals are not applicable as the style of such a venue must be expressive of the primary activity occurring in the venue while also taking careful steps to complement the surrounding built and natural environments and achieve the aesthetic vision of the City. However, each development shall consider the natural surroundings and environment, and design accordingly. To the extent practicable and taking into account the use of the venue, the design should promote pedestrian connectivity, incorporating shaded refuge areas, and quality design materials. Additionally, applicable design
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
136
requirements will only apply to the exterior of the facility and buildings internal to the venue and not visible from the public right-of-way are exempt.
a. Materials:
The design style of the large scale sports and entertainment venues, including subordinate accessory uses within the MSED, will be defined by a palette of materials that are expressive of the nature of the major sports and entertainment venue while combining with materials are associated to the region. Materials should convey an honest expression and permanence while avoiding the look of being applied rather than integrated. Materials used shall be of high quality, durable and genuine and should be consistently expressed through all architectural elements including accessory structures, walls, entry monumentation, landscaping and signage.
Acceptable materials include, but are not limited to:
? Sandstone
? Limestone
? Native Stone
? Cultured or Cast Stone
? Precast and Cast in Place Concrete
? Textured Concrete
? Sandblasted Concrete
? Exposed Aggregate Concrete
? Sandblasted Concrete Block
? Stucco
? Glass
? Tile (Accent only)
? Wood
? Corten Steel
? Stainless Steel
? Galvanized Steel
? Painted Steel
? Metal Panel systems
? Galvanized Aluminum
? Oxidized copper
? Rammed earth
Plaster or stucco finishes must be used in combination with other high quality materials and should not be the primary building material.
b. Building Design, Wall Planes and Roofs:
Rich and varying materials are desirable on wall planes, roofs, and the ground plane and to the extent reasonable for the scale of a major sports entertainment venue, and large, blank wall surfaces should be avoided. Box-like structures without architectural relief should be avoided but flat roofs with membrane roofing materials are allowed.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 5, Special Districts; Overlays
2932975.12
137
c. Retention Basins:
Retention basins should be well landscaped to help add to the aesthetic quality of a site by providing variation to the surface plan. Retention basins should not have a slope steeper than a four to one (4:1) grade. Where basins are deeper than three (3) feet, a six to one (6:1) ratio is the maximum slope. Retention basins may be constructed along street frontages.
d. Parking Structures:
The façade of any parking structures shall incorporate the theming/design of the major sports and entertainment venue. Structures should be designed to screen vehicles and headlights from views off site. The ground level of the structure should never consist of a featureless length of a wall.

All uses and development standards in a PAD District shall be established through the zoning approval process. All uses and development standards of a PAD District shall conform, to the extent possible, to a comparable Avondale Zoning District, or districts. Wherever used in this Section 6, the phrase comparable Zoning District shall mean to the most closely similar Avondale Zoning District based upon the land use designation, the General Plan, proposed uses, densities and lot sizes. The Zoning Administrator or designee shall determine the comparable Zoning District(s) based upon the land use designation, the General Plan, proposed uses, densities, lot sizes and other facts as appropriate. The approved PAD Narrative shall clearly delineate the uses and development standards and shall provide justification and mitigation for development standards that deviate from the standard Zoning Ordinance requirements for the comparable Zoning District.
B. Modification of Development Standards
Based upon a recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council may eliminate otherwise permitted uses in any comparable Zoning District and may specify modification of the regulations, requirements and standards than might be otherwise permitted by the comparable Zoning District. No modification of development standards shall be permitted unless the applicant
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 6, Planned Area Development District
2932975.12
152
provides substantial evidence indicating that the modifications will produce an environment superior to that which could have been produced by strict application of existing standards for comparable Zoning Districts.
C. Coordination with Subdivision Regulations
It is the intent of these PAD regulations that the review of the requirements of the City of Avondale Subdivision Regulations be carried out simultaneously with the review of the PAD.
D. Conformance
All approved plans, documents and permits shall conform to the approved PAD Narrative.
E. Design Standards
Site layout, architecture and landscaping shall be consistent with the Design Manuals as maintained by the Zoning Administrator or authorized designee.

C. PAD Regulations
The PAD Narrative, site plan, design standards and any other documents, exhibits or plans associated with the PAD, in the form approved by the City, shall become part of the regulations governing the use and development of the PAD and the Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect adoption of the PAD and the related documents and plans.
D. Expiration
Approval of any PAD zoning is conditioned on development of the first phase of the project commencing within four (4) years of the effective date of the ordinance approving the PAD zoning on the property.
1. Prior to the expiration of the four (4) year time condition, the property owner or authorized representative may submit an application for an extension to the City. A submittal of an application for extension of the four (4) year time condition does not toll the running of the time condition. Should the four (4) year time condition expire between the submittal of an application for a time extension and the public hearing on the requested extension, the PAD shall be subject to reversion as set forth in subsection 603(D)(3) below. Upon receipt of a request for extension, the Zoning Administrator shall submit the request to the City Council for consideration at a public hearing held pursuant to subsection 603(D)(2) below.

4. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner and authorized representative by certified mail of the City Councils intention to hold a hearing to determine compliance with the four (4) year time condition, and to revert the zoning on the property to its former classification if the condition is determined by the City Council to have not been met. All such notices shall be made at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. The City Council may, in its sole discretion, either grant an extension of the time condition, subject to the limitation on the number of extensions set forth in subsection 603(D)(5) below, or revert the zoning on the property to its prior zoning classification.
5. The City Council may, in its sole and absolute discretion, grant up to three (3) two (2) year extensions of the time condition. The City Council may include conditions on any extension as it deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.
6. Following the commencement of the first phase of the project, the Zoning Administrator shall monitor the project to ensure compliance with the approved PAD phasing schedule. Upon the Zoning Administrators initial determination that the phasing schedule is not being met, no further review or approval of any project site plan or plat shall occur until it is determined that good cause exists for delay in the construction of the project. Should the project fail to proceed as scheduled, a public hearing shall be held by the City Council to determine the cause of the delay. At the public hearing on the matter, if the City Council determines that there is not good cause for the delay, it may impose additional conditions on the PAD to ensure compliance with the phasing schedule. If such additional conditions and the phasing schedule are not met, the Zoning Administrator may set the matter for public hearing, according to the process set forth in subsection 603(D)(4) above, on a possible reversion of the PAD zoning. If the City Council determines that good cause exists, it may amend the PAD development phasing schedule.
7. For purposes of this Section, the terms commence, commencing and commencement shall mean (a) for a PAD smaller than five (5) acres, physical vertical construction activity in accordance with a valid building permit issued by the City and (b) for a PAD five (5) acres and larger, beginning of construction of off-site infrastructure including streets, sidewalks, water and wastewater, so long as such infrastructure is completed prior to expiration of the City-issued development permit issued therefore.
8. The provisions of this subsection 603(D) shall apply to all PADs approved prior to April 2, 2009, except that such provisions shall not apply to any previously approved PAD for which the time condition thereon has expired prior to February 1, 2009.

A. Application, Review, and Approval Process
1. For new developments where the number of parking spaces being proposed does not meet the Citys minimum requirements or exceeds the Citys maximum requirements, a Parking Demand Study shall be submitted as part of the applicants Design Review application submittal.
2. For existing developments where a change in the use of a building or site would result in fewer parking spaces being provided than the minimum requirement allows, a Parking Demand Study is required to be submitted concurrently with tenant improvement plans. A Parking Demand Study shall not be required for existing developments which, through a change in use, will include parking in excess of the Citys allowable maximum.
3. The Zoning Administrator or designee may approve a request to modify the required number of parking spaces in accordance with the Administrative Relief process outlined in Zoning Ordinance Section 1, Administration and Procedures.
4. The Parking Demand Study shall provide a quantitative analysis justifying any proposed increase or reduction in parking. Increases or decreases in the number of parking spaces may be granted when any of the following applies:
a. A business concurrently employs more people per square foot (or less people per square foot) than the accepted industry standard for that use, and is able to demonstrate this variation from the mean through a statistical comparison.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 8, Parking
2932975.12
191
b. A business generates more customers, visitors, and or clients per square foot (or less customers, visitors, and/or clients per square foot) than the accepted industry standard for that use (to be determined through a study of existing, comparable uses in the region as determined by the Zoning Administrator), and is able to demonstrate this variation from the mean through a statistical comparison.
c. Lowered parking demand can be predicted as a result of sharing parking between intermittent uses, occurring on the same property or within a master planned development, with non-conflicting parking demands (e.g. a nightclub and a bank).
d. A development is designed to take advantage of adjacent public transit opportunities.
B. Approval Criteria
1. Requests for Parking Reductions.
In order to approve any request to reduce parking below minimum requirements, all of the following criteria must be met:
a. The reduction in parking will not cause fewer off-street parking spaces to be provided for the proposed use than the number of such spaces necessary to accommodate all vehicles attributable to such use under the normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of operation of such use.
b. The reduction in parking will not increase the demand for parking spaces upon the public streets in the immediate vicinity of the proposed use.
c. The reduction in parking will not increase the demand for parking spaces upon adjacent private property in the immediate vicinity of the proposed use, unless as part of an approved joint-parking agreement (where allowed).
d. The applicant will incorporate measures intended to reduce vehicle trips to the site, including, but not limited to, the provision of spaces reserved for car pool use, the provision of weather-protected short term bike parking and the provision of showers and changing facilities in commercial buildings over fifty thousand (50,000) square feet in floor area.
2. Requests for Parking Increases.
In order to approve any request to increase parking above maximum requirements, all of the following criteria must be met:
a. The proposed increase in parking is the least possible increase to accommodate all vehicles attributable to such use under the normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of operation of such use.
b. The increase in parking will not negatively impact the aesthetics of the site from the perspective of adjacent streets and properties.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 8, Parking
2932975.12

SECTION 10
SECTION 10 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSESSEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
1001 Purpose
It is the purpose of this Section 10 to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this Section 10 have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this Section 10 to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Section 10 to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
1002 Findings
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney Generals Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City Council finds:
A. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are typically uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in the City to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
B. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this Ordinance as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
C. Sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
D. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
E. Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
F. At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 10, Sexually Oriented Businesses
2932975.12
232
infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
G. Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States and in Arizona.
H. According to the Arizona Department of Health Services as of 1999 there have been 5,786 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Arizona.
I. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-third of a million cases being reported in 1999.
J. The surgeon general of the United States, in a report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
K. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. According to the Surgeon Generals Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior, dated July 9, 2001, nearly two-thirds of the 774,467 AIDS cases reported since 1987 were sexually transmitted.
L. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
M. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films.
N. The findings noted in paragraphs A through M above raise substantial governmental concerns.
O. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
P. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Q. Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.
City of Avondale Zoning Ordinance  Section 10, Sexually Oriented Businesses
2932975.12
233
R. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
S. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
T. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this Section 10 is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
U. The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business operator or employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Section 10.
V. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this Section 10.
