liable for perjury.

this chapter more than three years prior to such January 1st and July 1st, respectively, shall be credited or
refunded.
D. Credit Memorandum or Refund. When any claim is allowed, the City Council may issue a credit
memorandum to the claimant for the amount so allowed or refund such amount in such manner as the City
Council shall determine or as set forth in Section 3.32.070 (E) below.
E. Refunds. In case the City Council determines that the claimant is entitled to a refund, such refund shall be
made only from such budgeted amount as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely that the
amount budgeted would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period covered by such
budgeted amount to elect to receive a cash refund, the City Council will make such refunds only in hardship
cases (i.e., in cases in which the claimant cannot use a credit memorandum.)

intrastate telecommunications by a person at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross charge for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer by such person. However, such tax is not

the United States, be made the subject of taxation by municipalities in this state.
2. The act or privilege of originating in the city of St. Charles or receiving in the city of St. Charles
interstate telecommunications by a person at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross charge for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer by such person. To prevent actual multi-state
taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this paragraph, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any
tax enacted pursuant to this paragraph to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in
such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this
state. However, such tax is not imposed on the act or privileges to the extent such act or privilege may
not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by
municipalities in this state.

business in this state and making or effectuating the sale at retail and shall be remitted by such retailer to the
city of St. Charles. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to an ordinance authorized by this section and
any such tax collected pursuant to an ordinance authorized by this section and any such tax collected by
such retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the city of St. Charles. Retailers shall collect the
tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications when sold for use. The tax authorized by this section shall constitute a debt of the
purchaser to the retailer who provides such taxable services until paid, and if unpaid, is recoverable at law in
the same manner as the original charge for such taxable services. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from
the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the city of St. Charles.
Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate
and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

5.08.095 – Late Night Permit
A. The late night permit is issued as a condition of a Class B-Restaurant License and Class C-Tavern; Bar;
Saloon Licenses and authorizes the holder of a Class B or Class C license to apply for either a 1:00 a.m. or
2:00 a.m. late night permit. The City Council may modify the number of Late Night Permits upon the
application, revocation, surrender, expiration without renewal or abandonment of a Class B, Class C or Late
Night Permit. Class B and C licenses, absent a Class E-6 Temporary License Permit or Late Night Permit,
will be permitted to operate until either 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m. immediately following the day of the City of St.
Charles sponsored St. Patrick’s Day Parade, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and New Year’s Eve.
B. The City Council may, but is not limited to, consider the following criteria in reviewing and recommending
the issuance of the late night permit to the Liquor Control Commissioner.
1. The surrounding land uses,
2. The business concept,
3. The proximity to other liquor establishments,
4. The applicant’s prior business experience,
5. The public’s health, safety and welfare,
6. Public Safety resources,
7. Market conditions,
8. Any other criteria that is relevant to the issuance, establishment, and administration of a retail liquor
license.
C. Annually, the liquor license renewal process shall commence on the first city business day in February.
Current license holders shall submit a renewal application and include any requested changes. For those
license holders applying for a new or renewing a late night permit, they are required to specify whether they
are applying for the 1:00 a.m. or the 2:00 a.m. permit. In addition, any new or renewal applications shall
Title 5 - Business Licenses and Regulations
20
include a current business concept outlining the operations intended during the late night permit term of one
year, in conjunction with the liquor license to be issued on May 1 of the same year. Failure to provide a
timely renewal application or late night permit application may result in a delay in issuing said license and
permit by May 1 of that year.
D. Upon receipt of a new or renewal application, the Liquor Commissioner shall cause a review of the previous
year license application to determine whether there have been any changes noted with regard to ownership,
management or business concept. This application shall be forwarded to:
1. Chief of Police
2. Fire Department
3. Finance Department
4. Community Development Department
E. The city departments indicated in Section D will review any infractions of any city code, reflecting negatively
on the license holder that should be taken into account by the Liquor Control Commission and City Council.
That information shall be returned to the Liquor Commissioner for review. In addition, the Chief of Police
shall cause a review of the police related activity which will support a recommendation from the Chief of
Police on whether the late night permit shall be issued and whether a 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m. closing is
recommended based on the permit application. The Chief of Police shall forward the recommendation to the
Liquor Commissioner.
F. Any application and recommendation for a new or renewal of a late night permit, shall be reviewed by the
Liquor Control Commission. Based on this review the Local Liquor Commissioner shall make a
recommendation on issuance to City Council. An applicant for a late night permit shall have the opportunity
to be present and provide input on said application, prior to the Liquor Control Commission making a
recommendation. Late night permits and renewals of late night permits shall be issued by the Liquor
Commissioner with the advice and consent of the City Council.
G. Any new liquor license application where a new late night permit is also applied for shall follow the same
review process as outlined in paragraphs B, C, D, E and F of this Chapter.
H. Notice of Violation Process-Late Night Permit. If during a liquor license year, May 1 through April 30, where
a liquor license holder has been issued a late night permit and a notice of violation is issued by the Liquor
Control Commissioner, the Liquor Control Commission shall hold a hearing on the matter. The liquor
licensee with the late night permit shall be given notice of the purpose, date, time and location of the hearing
in a similar manner to a liquor license violation. The matter will be heard before the Liquor Control
Commission in the same manner as any license violation. The Liquor Control Commission shall provide
advice and consent to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, who shall make a final decision on the
matter.
I. Cause to Reduce Hours, Revoke Late Night Permit or Not Issue Late Night Permit. In the event that a liquor
license holder, has applied for or been issued a late night permit, and has demonstrated circumstances
giving reason to review whether that late night permit shall be issued, reduced in hours or revoked, the
Liquor Control Commission shall receive input from these city departments:
1. Finance Department as it relates to unpaid fees, utilities or city taxes;
2. Fire Department as it relates to repetitive fire code violations affecting health and safety;
3. Community Development Department, Building and Code Enforcement Division as it relates to
building code violations;
4. Police Department as it relates to repetitive calls for service that are indicative of underage patrons,
over service of patrons, or liquor license violations affecting the safety of the general public where the
licensee is not taking proactive measures to abate the problems;
5. Other departments with applicable information.
J. The license holder shall have the opportunity to respond to information in a public hearing prior to any action
being taken, by the Liquor Control Commission before sending any recommendation to City Council.
K. The Liquor Control Commission may recommend the issuance or denial of a requested late night permit for
1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m., or reduction in hours based on cause to the City Council for final decision.
L. In the event a late night permit, due to a violation, is revoked or the hour for closing is reduced, there shall be
no reimbursement of the later night permit fee.

administration of this article.
B. The massage commissioner, after a hearing conducted by the massage commission may suspend or revoke

the provisions of this article. In lieu of suspension or revocation of the license, the massage commissioner
may instead levy a fine on the licensee. The fine imposed shall not exceed $500.00 for each violation.
Each day on which a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
C. No license issued under this article shall be suspended or revoked and no licensee shall be fined except
after a public hearing by the massage commission with a seven-day written notice to the licensee affording

The purpose of this Chapter is to maintain existing trees within the City to the greatest extent possible, while
allowing for reasonable development of private property. Trees are assets to the community in many ways,
including contributing to its character and scenic beauty, clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil,
reducing the rate of stormwater runoff, providing nesting areas for birds and habitat for other wildlife, conserving
energy, and providing shade and windbreaks. The health and general welfare of the community, as well as its tax
base, are enhanced when trees are preserved.

performing the work. Written approval from the City must be received before proceeding with any
alterations, even if such alterations are allowed by the TCA Guidelines.
C. Any encroachment in the Tree Conservation Area that has not been previously authorized by City
Administrator or their designee, must be removed immediately by the property owner and at their expense.
The property owner may however submit a written request to the City Administrator or their designee
requesting that the encroachment be allowed to remain. Each request will be reviewed individually by the
City Administrator or their designee, and on a case-by-case basis taking the TCA Guidelines and the
following criteria into consideration:
1. The length of the time the encroachment has been installed and whether it was installed by a previous
owner.
2. The quality/condition of the vegetation in the area prior to the installation of the encroachment.
3. Whether the encroachment can be easily relocated outside of the easement.
4. Potential for further damage to vegetation caused by removal of the encroachment.
The final determination shall be made by the City Administrator or their designee and shall be final. If
any encroachment in the Tree Conservation Area is authorized to remain, it shall not be expanded,
enlarged, or enhanced during its usable lifespan. At such a point that the encroachment is no longer
usable or functional for its original purpose, it shall be completely removed at the property owner’s
expense. Removal shall include all above and below grade improvements, including, but not limited
to, foundations, footings, utilities. The encroachment area shall be restored to its original condition. If
the original condition is unknown, then the encroachment area shall be restored to match the
conditions of the surrounding area.
D. When active restorative measures such as planting or vegetation removal are necessary to bring a property
into compliance with the TCA Guidelines, the owner shall submit a restoration plan within 60 days of written
notification that the property is in violation of the TCA Guidelines. If the City Administrator or his designee
determines the following proposed restoration plan will restore the area to a condition that conforms with the
TCA Guidelines, he shall approve it. The owner shall restore the disturbed area in conformance with the
approved restoration plan within twelve months following its approval.

8.30.060 – Emergency removal
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Chapter, a Tree Preservation Plan or other approval is not required when
removal of a tree is necessary due to an emergency situation posing an immediate danger to a person, property or
the community, and where such emergency renders compliance with the permit process unreasonable. The
individual who proposes to remove the tree(s) shall contact the City Administrator or his designee to receive
permission for emergency removal of the tree(s). If the contact is not during business hours, the individual shall
leave a voicemail message indicating name, time, tree location, and phone number, and may then proceed with
emergency removal.

1. A proposed Tree Preservation Plan shall include the following written and graphic information:
1.1 A survey of existing trees six inches (6”) or more DBH within the entire site or lot, identifying
their locations, size and species, and a plan overlaid on the survey or at the same scale
showing proposed Construction Zones and Tree Preservation Zones.
1.2 The proposed Tree Preservation Zone shall encompass all of the property having six inch (6”)
DBH or larger trees that will not be disturbed by construction activities. All buildings,
structures, parking areas, driveways, stormwater management facilities, utilities, and other
site improvements shall be located to minimize tree damage and removal; preference shall be
given to tree preservation when reasonable alternatives are available for the location of
buildings and other site improvements.
1.3 The proposed Construction Zone shall include only the areas to be directly affected by
buildings, site improvements and grading activities related to the approved construction. The
Construction Zone shall be as small as possible, considering factors such as the depth of
excavation, necessary spoil areas, and space required for access to construction activity.
1.4 The location and description of protective fencing, root pruning, canopy pruning and other
protective and conservation measures necessary to protect the trees within the Tree
Conservation Zone shall be indicated.
2. Standards: Removal of trees shall be authorized by Tree Preservation Plans only when one or more of the
following conditions exist, as determined by the City:
2.1 The tree is diseased, dead or dying.
2.2 The tree is damaged or injured to the extent that it is likely to die or become diseased, or
such that it becomes a hazard.
2.3 Removal of the tree is consistent with good forestry practices, that is, consideration is given
to the species of the tree, location, conditions, age, safety, and the historic and aesthetic
value of the tree to be removed.
2.4 Removal of the tree will enhance the health of remaining trees within the immediate vicinity.
2.5 Removal of the tree is required to repair a sewer line or water main, or excavation for such
repair will damage the tree to the extent that it is likely to die or become diseased.
2.6 All reasonable efforts have been undertaken in the land planning, architectural and
engineering design of the proposed building, building addition, development or site
improvement to minimize tree damage and/or removal, and the tree or trees must be
removed to provide adequate space for the permitted construction.

A. All Tree Preservation Zones shall be maintained free of all construction activity, construction equipment,
material or spoils storage, compaction, fill, and debris.
B. Crushed limestone, hydrocarbons, or other materials detrimental to trees shall not be dumped within the root
zone of any tree to be preserved nor at any higher elevation where drainage toward the tree could affect its
health.
C. No attachments, signs, fences, or wires, other than those approved for bracing, guying or wrapping trees,
shall be attached to trees during the construction period.
D. Unless otherwise authorized by an approved Tree Preservation Plan, no soil shall be removed or added
within the root zone of any tree to be preserved.
E. The boundary between the Construction Zone and the Tree Preservation Zone shall be fenced during the
course of construction in a manner that clearly identifies where construction activity is prohibited. The
Building and Zoning Commissioner and City Engineer shall have the authority to issue a stop work order
until adequate fencing is provided or repaired.

B. Unauthorized removal of trees: If a tree is removed prior to approval of a Tree Preservation Plan or other
approval, and the City Administrator or his designee determines the removed tree was of a species or
condition that would have justified approval of a Tree Preservation Plan or other approval to remove it if
application had been made, the penalties hereof shall not apply.
C. Replacement Trees. In addition to any fine that may be assessed, each tree of six inches or more DBH
which is removed in violation of this Chapter shall be replaced with trees of at least a three inch (3”) caliper
selected from the list of Approved Trees according to the following schedule. The diameter of removed trees

9.21.010 – Loitering
1. For the purposes of this Chapter, the terms “loiter” or “loitering” shall mean remaining idle in one location or
substantially the same location, and includes the concepts of spending time, loafing, walking about
aimlessly and the colloquial expression of “hanging around”.
2. It is unlawful for a person to Loiter in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals
under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the
person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify themselves, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal themselves or any object. Unless flight by the person or other
circumstance makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under
this Chapter, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting said person to identify themselves and explain their presence and conduct. No person shall be
convicted of an offense under this Chapter if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the preceding
sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if believed by the law
enforcement officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.
3. Specific instances. It is unlawful for a person to Loiter in a public place in such a manner as to:
1. Create or cause to be created a danger of breach of the peace;
2. To obstruct, or threaten the obstruction of other persons or vehicles, which shall include, but not be
limited to, sitting or lounging upon sidewalks, parking lots or other public ways;
3. Molest or interfere with any person lawfully in a public place, including, but not limited to, making
unsolicited statements of an offensive, insulting or inflammatory nature, which are calculated to, or tend
to incite an immediate breach of the peace by any person to whom, or in whose hearing, they are
made.
4. Not withstanding the foregoing, no person shall be guilty of Loitering unless such person refuses or fails to
leave the location or moves to another public location and continues to Loiter there.
5. Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined one
hundred ($100) dollars for each offense, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day
during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

B. Every person who, in violation of the visitation provisions of a court order relating to child custody, detains or
conceals a child with the intent to deprive another person of his or her rights to visitation shall be guilty of
unlawful visitation interference.
C. A person committing unlawful visitation interference is guilty of a petty offense.
D. Any law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is
committing an act in violation of this ordinance shall issue to that person a notice to appear.

1. Be in writing;
2. State the name of the person and his address, if known;
3. Set forth the nature of the offense;
4. Be signed by the officer issuing the notice; and
5. Request the person to appear before a court at a certain time and place.
F. Upon failure of the person to appear, a summons or warrant of arrest may be issued.
G. It is an affirmative defense that:
1. A person or lawful custodian committed the act to protect the child from imminent physical harm,
provided that the defendant’s belief that there was physical harm imminent was reasonable and that
the defendant’s conduct in withholding visitation rights was a reasonable response to the harm
believed imminent;
2. The act was committed with the mutual consent of all parties having a right to custody and visitation of
the child; or
3. The act was otherwise authorized by law.
H. A person convicted of unlawful visitation interference shall not be subject to a civil contempt citation for the
same conduct for violating visitation provisions of a court order issued under the Illinois Marriage and
Dissolution of Marriage Act.

a person has taken all reasonable steps may be considered as an affirmative defense as to whether
such person “reasonably should know” that an underage person will or does consume or possess any
illicit drugs or alcoholic beverages.
2. It also is unlawful for any person to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent possession or consumption
of illicit drugs or alcoholic beverages by an underage person at any such event or gathering. A person
who hosts an event or gathering does not have to be present at the event or gathering to be in violation
of this subsection A.
B.
1. A person is responsible for violating Subsection A of this Section if that person intentionally aids,
advises, hires, counsels, conspires with, or solicits another person to commit a violation of Subsection
A.
2. A person is responsible for violating Subsection A of this Section if that person knows or should have
known about the committing of a prohibited act and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the
prohibited act.
C.
1. A person who hosts an event or gathering shall not be in violation of this Chapter if he or she
undertakes one of the following steps before any other person makes a complaint about the event or
gathering:
a. seeks assistance from the St. Charles Police Department or other law enforcement agency to
remove any person who refuses to abide by the host’s performance of the duties imposed by this
Chapter, or
b. terminates the event or gathering because the host has been unable to prevent underage
persons from consuming illicit drugs or alcoholic beverages despite having taken all reasonable
steps to do so.
D. This Chapter does not apply to conduct involving the use of alcoholic beverages that occurs at a religious
ceremony or that is exclusively between an underage person and his or her parent, as permitted by Illinois
State Law.

applicable law.
B. After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be
sought for a final determination of a code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision, and order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
C. In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment ordering a defendant to correct a
code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred
by a municipality to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees, court costs, and costs
related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and may be collected in accordance with
applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a Hearing Officer pursuant to this subsection (c), the
municipality shall provide notice to the defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a hearing
before the administrative Hearing Officer to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with the
judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a hearing, which shall not be less than seven (7) days from
the date that notice is served. If notice is served by mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the

real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the City
under this Ordinance. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
E. A Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon a
petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing Officer determines that
the petitioner’s failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time if the petitioner establishes
that the municipality did not provide proper service of process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this
subsection (e), the Hearing Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has
been recorded for any debt due and owing the municipality as a result of the vacated default judgment.

evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in this Section, the hearing officer
shall enter a written order finding the Owner civilly liable to the City for an administrative fee in the amount of

46
10.40.090 – Illegally parked vehicles - Removal by police - Storage - Post-storage
hearings for impounded vehicles - Conduct of hearing - Decisions of the hearing
officers and their effect.
A. The police department and all members thereof assigned to traffic duty are authorized to remove and tow
away, or have removed and towed away by commercial towing service, any car or other vehicle illegally
parked, or in any place where such parked vehicle creates or constitutes a traffic hazard, blocks the use of a
fire hydrant; or obstructs, or may obstruct, the movement of any emergency vehicle; or any vehicle which has
been parked in any public street or other public place for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours or
more.
B. Cars so towed away shall be stored on any city property or in a public garage or parking lot and shall be
restored to the owner or operator thereof after payment of the expense incurred by the City in removing and
storing such vehicles.
C. Post-storage Hearings for Impounded Vehicles: As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter by or
at the request of the City, its agents or employees, a person who has a legal entitlement to possession of the
vehicle has a right to a post-seizure administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause
to impound the vehicle if such person files a written demand, on forms so provided for such a hearing, with
the City within ten (10) days after such person has learned such vehicle has been impounded or within ten
(10) days after the mailing of the date set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first. The notice of
stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner, or their agent, and to the garage
where the vehicle is stored within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after impounding
and storage of the vehicle.
D. Conduct of Hearing: A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer designated by the Mayor within
forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of a written demand therefore from the person seeking the hearing unless
such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays, and City holidays are to be
excluded from the calculation of the forty-eight (48) hour period. The hearing officer shall be someone other
than the person who directed the impounding and storage of the vehicle. The sole issue before the hearing
officer shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. "Probable cause to
impound" means such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that
there was sufficient breach of local, state, or federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the
vehicle. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by
technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that
such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the
person demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not, the person requesting the
hearing). The hearing officer's decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding in connection with the
impound in question and any criminal charges involved in such proceedings may only be challenged in the
appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final. Failure of the registered or legal owner, or
their agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
such hearing.
E. Decisions of the Hearing Officers and Their Effect: The hearing officer shall only determine that, as to the
vehicle in issue, either:
1. There was probable cause to impound the vehicle; or
2. There was no such probable cause.
In the event that the hearing officer determines that there was no probable cause, the hearing officer
shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the
possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt of the possessor's copy of such
certificate, the official police garage having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its
possessor. Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the City in
accordance with arrangements made between the City and the official police garages. If the
possessor fails to present such certificate to the official police garage having custody of the vehicle
within twenty-four (24) hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the official police garage is not
open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. Such
certificate shall advise the possessor of such requirement.

general penalty provision set forth in Section 10.60.010 of the Municipal Code of the City of St. Charles. Each

Such placard must be prominently displayed by hanging it from the rear view mirror so as to be visible through the
front windshield. If no rear view mirror is available, the placard may be prominently displayed on the dashboard or
sun visor so as to be visible through the front windshield.
A placard will be issued for a 90-day period to applicants who have a disability that is temporary in nature, and
may be renewed once for a like period based upon continued disability. Any person needing more than one (1)
renewal is to be referred to the Secretary of State’s Office for a handicapped parking placard.
The temporary placards will follow the same design, color, and size specifications as the placards issued by the
Illinois Secretary of State, and will have identification of the issuing authority. Temporary placards will be issued
for a 90-day period. All individuals with permanent disabilities are to be referred to the Illinois Secretary of State’s
office.

parking where the motor vehicle constitutes a traffic hazard and the motor vehicle must be moved at the instruction
and request of a law enforcement officer to a location designated by the officer. Any motor vehicle bearing
registration plates specified in this section or such devices as local authorities have
deemed proper as evidence that the vehicle is operated by or for a handicapped person or disabled veteran may
park, in addition to any other lawful place, in any parking place specifically reserved by posting of an official sign
for such vehicle. Parking privileges granted by this section are strictly limited to the person to whom the special

10.43.040 – Illegally parked vehicles - Removal by Police - Storage - Post storage
hearings for impounded vehicles - Conduct of hearing - Decisions of hearing officer
and their effect.
A. Any vehicle unlawfully parked may be towed by, or at the direction of a police officer of the city.
B. Cars so towed away shall be stored on any city property or in a public garage or parking lot and shall be
restored to the owner or operator thereof after payment of the expense incurred by the city in removing and
storing such vehicles.
C. Post-Storage Hearings for Impounded Vehicles: As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter by or
at the request of the city, its agents or employees, a person who has a legal entitlement to possession of the
vehicle has a right to a post-seizure administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause
to impound the vehicle if such person files a written demand, on forms so provided for such a hearing, with
the city within ten days after such person has learned such vehicle has been impounded or within ten days
after the mailing of the date set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first. The notice of stored
vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner, or their agent, and to the garage where
the vehicle is stored within forty-eight hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after impounding and
storage of the vehicle.
D. Conduct of Hearing: A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer designated by the Mayor within
forty-eight hours of receipt of a written demand therefore from the person seeking the hearing unless such
person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and city holidays are to be excluded from
the calculation of the forty-eight-hour period. The hearing officer shall be someone other than the person
who directed the impounding and storage of the vehicle. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be
whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. "Probable cause to impound" means
such a state of facts as would lead sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the removal of the vehicle. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not
be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of
establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry
the burden of establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall
be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not, the person
requesting the hearing). The hearing officer's decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding in
connection with the impound in question and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be
challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final. Failure of the registered or
legal owner, or their agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver
of the right to such hearing.
E. Decision of the hearing officers and their effect: The hearing officer shall only determine that, as to the
vehicle in issue, either:
1. There was probable cause to impound the vehicle; or
2. There was no such probable cause. In the event that the hearing officer determines that there was no
probable cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of
which shall be given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt of the
possessor's copy of such certificate, the official police garage having custody of the vehicle, shall
release the vehicle to its possessor. Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees
shall be paid by the city in accordance with arrangements made between the city and the official police
garages. If the possessor fails to present such certificate to the official police garage having custody of
the vehicle within twenty-four hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the official police garage
is not open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. Such
certificate shall advise the possessor of such requirement.

13.08.298 – Power cost adjustment
A. Applicability – all rates.
B. Definition. A Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) will be applied to energy consumption to account for
fluctuations in the cost of power. PCA values can be positive or negative and will be applied on a quarterly
basis using the following formula:
1. Quarterly estimated power cost will be subtracted from estimated revenue from sales to create a target
quarterly income number.
2. Quarterly actual power cost will be subtracted from actual revenue from sales to create an actual
income number.
3. The actual income will be subtracted from the target to create a quarterly income delta number.
4. The quarterly income delta will be divided by the estimated KWH consumption for the next quarter to
create a $/KWH number that will be the PCA for the following quarter.
5. The goal of the PCA is to create additional revenues, or issue billing credits, that are equal to the
previous quarterly income delta. Differences between the previous quarter income delta and the
actual revenue or billing credit that the PCA creates, will be added into the future quarterly PCA.
6. Formula:
Estimated Revenue – Estimated Power Cost = Target Income
Actual Revenue – Actual Power Cost = Actual Income
(Target Income – Actual Income)/(Estimated Future Consumption) = PCA
7. That the PCA shall be increased by an additional 5% if electrical service is provided to a service
address outside the corporate limits of the City of St. Charles unless the customer has an electric
service agreement with the City that was in existence prior to May 6, 2013 that provides for a different
additional charge.

13.08.315 – Interconnection services for on-site generation facilities
St. Charles Municipal Electric Utility (SCMEU) shall make available, upon request, interconnection services to
any customer that meets the required guidelines. Interconnection services in this Section refers to on-site
generating facilities connected to SCMEU distribution system in a manner that will allow excess electricity
generated by the eligible on-site generating facility to be safely delivered onto SCMEU’s electric distribution
system. Guidelines for interconnecting to the utility system are as follows:
A. Only generating facilities that have been approved by SCMEU shall be interconnected with SCMEU’s
electric distribution system.
B. Interconnection services shall only be available to premises with aggregated total generation at a single
customer premise of less than 1 MW.
C. All interconnections shall comply with IEEE Standard 1547 for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with
Electric Power Systems (IEEE 1547) as amended from time to time.
D. SCMEU is under no obligation to purchase energy supplied to it under this section. This does not preclude
the customer from meeting applicable standards that would allow the customer to supply power onto the
utilities system and receive credit for such energy under the Renewable Generation Energy Purchase
(RGEP) Policy (set forth in Section 13.08.320).
E. If the customer qualifies under these interconnection standards but does not qualify under the RGEP Policy
then any energy delivered to the utility system shall be surrendered to the utility for no value/credit. SCMEU
will install, at customer expense, a meter that will not provide any credit for energy delivered to the utility
system and the customer will pay any additional costs associated with the meter change.
F. Customers will comply with all other applicable utility standards for interconnection.
G. Capacity of 10kW or less and interconnected to the utility system shall comply with IEEE 1547 Section 5.5,
Periodic Interconnection Tests. All interconnection related protective functions, equipment and associated
batteries shall be tested at intervals specified by the manufacturer system integrator, or the authority that has
jurisdiction over the Distributed Resources interconnection, or all tests shall be performed every three (3)
years, whichever is shorter. Periodic test reports shall be maintained and submitted to the SCMEU
Engineering Department.
H. Systems of greater than 10kW shall perform all interconnection-related protective functions, equipment and
associated battery testing on a yearly basis. All test reports shall be submitted to the SCMEU Engineering
Department after completion of the yearly testing.
I. Reports required under Section 13.08.315 paragraphs G. and H., must be submitted within 30 days of the
anniversary date of the energizing of the interconnect generation. If the required reports are not received
within the 30 day period, the generation must be disconnected until such time as the reports are submitted
and accepted.

13.08.320 – Renewable generation energy purchase policy
St. Charles Municipal Electric Utility (SCMEU) shall make available, upon request, renewable generation energy
purchase (RGEP) service to any customer taking service from SCMEU and who meets the requirements set forth
in this policy. For purposes of this Section “RGEP” service means service to an electric customer under which
electric energy generated by that electric customer from an eligible on-site renewable energy generating facility,
owned by that customer and, under some circumstances delivered to the local distribution facilities, may be used
to offset electric energy provided by the SCMEU to the electric customer as provided for in this policy. Such
service shall be subject to the following provisions:
A. For purposes of this policy an eligible on-site generating facility shall be defined as a renewable generating
facility such as a photovoltaic facility or small wind turbines. Other forms of renewable generation, such as
sources fueled by landfill methane, fuel cells, or micro turbines fueled by renewable fuels shall be
considered on a case-by-case basis. In all cases facilities interconnected must be deemed to be renewable
by SCMEU to qualify for this policy.
B. The electric generating facility must also abide by SCMEU Interconnection Standards (13.08.315).
C. Subject to the limitations set forth herein, SCMEU shall make RGEP service available upon request to any
SCMEU electric customer with a qualifying generating facility of 10kW capacity or less.
D. Any generating facility greater than 10kW but less than 1MW shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The decision with respect to such facilities shall be made by SCMEU based upon its contractual obligations,
system safety issues and other relevant information.
E. Total RGEP capacity interconnected under this policy for the SCMEU system shall not exceed 2% of the
system’s peak, as it existed in the prior calendar year. In the event that the system peak is reduced such that
the existing net capacity exceeds the 2% level, those existing RGEP customers shall be allowed to continue
under this policy. However, no new interconnections will be allowed until such time as the system peak
grows such that RGEP capacity is again no greater than 2% of the system’s peak.
F. Energy generated by the customer-owned generator will offset the energy required by the customer’s load
during the billing period. For any energy generated by the customer in excess of the energy required by the
customer’s loads for a given billing period a credit (as set forth in paragraph G. below) shall be carried
forward to the customer’s next billing period. In no case shall credits for excess energy be carried forward
for a period greater than three billing periods. In the event of termination of an account qualifying for RGEP
under this policy, any outstanding credits are surrendered. Under no circumstances will there be payments,
or credit transfers for excess energy. Credits shall be for energy only; there is no credit for capacity
(demand).
G. Excess energy will be credited based on the wholesale cost SCMEU pays. For customers served under
residential Rate 1, small general service Rate 3, and Governmental Outdoor Sports Lighting Rate 6, the
credit will be determined by the average wholesale cost per kilowatt-hour paid by SCMEU to our energy
supplier in the previous fiscal year. The credit for customers served under general service Rate 5 and
Industrial Rate 7 will be the kilowatt-hour charge specified in the respective rates set forth in this Chapter for
the month in which the credit is earned.
H. Any costs SCMEU incurs associated with the RGEP program, including but not limited to changes in
metering, other physical facilities or billing-related costs, shall be borne by the participants in the RGEP
program.

demand response into any organized electric or ancillary services markets operated or administered by PJM
(or any successor independent system operator or regional transmission organization) or otherwise
participating in such markets with any demand response resources whether directly or through a third-party
aggregator.
B. Exception to general prohibition. Notwithstanding the general prohibition stated in subsection A, above, the
SCMEU, acting with and through its power supplier, Illinois Municipal Electric Agency (IMEA), is hereby
approved, authorized and permitted to operate as a Curtailment Service Provider with respect to demand
response resources within the City’s municipal electric utility system, including any generation owned by the
City, and to offer and sell such demand response resources into programs and markets of PJM
Interconnection, L.L.C. or its duly authorized successor. Participation shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the IMEA’s Demand Response Program, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A, as such
program is amended by the IMEA from time to time.
C. All costs incurred by the SCMEU for implementation and continued operation of the Demand Response
Program will be the direct responsibility of the customer. Costs will be billed to the customer at the time the
expense is incurred. These costs include the cost of metering equipment, monitoring equipment,
communication devices, communication services, extra meter reading (if required), maintenance of
equipment, equipment replacement, billing expense and any other additional costs directly or indirectly
related to this program. Charges include cost for equipment, labor or both.

the Code of Federal Regulations, revised as of July 1, 1994, published by the Office of the Federal Register,
National Archives and Records Administration are hereby incorporated by reference.
1. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration
of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director of Public Works may impose equivalent concentration or mass
limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
2. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by
the same standard, the Director of Public Works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste
stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
3. A User may obtain a variance from USEPA, or if authorized, IEPA of a categorical pretreatment standard if
the User can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors
relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
4. A User may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
5. The User shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process.

any other substances regulated. Where necessary, facilities to prevent an accidental discharge of the above
mentioned materials shall be provided and maintained at the User's own cost and expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before
construction and operation of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the User from the responsibility to modify the User's facility as necessary to meet all the requirements.
Users shall notify the City immediately upon knowing of the discharge of substances prohibited or regulated by
this chapter. Notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentrations
and volume, and corrective actions to be taken. The User shall be required to submit a written explanation of any
"slug loads" or accidental discharges within five working days after the first notification.
Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places advising employees whom to call in the event of an
accidental spill of prohibited materials. In lieu of using signs, User may use an alternative method for training
employees in the procedures for reporting of accidental discharges.
Follow up reports may be required as needed. Such report, or reports, shall not relieve the User of any expense,
loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the User of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in
addition to any other remedies available, result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater permit.
13.12.500 – Wastewater discharge permit requirement
A. No Significant Industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a
wastewater discharge permit from the Director of Public Works, except that a Significant Industrial User that
has filed a timely application pursuant to Section 13.12.540 of this chapter may continue to discharge for the
time period specified therein, provided the discharge in all other respects does not violate any provision of
this chapter.
B. The Director of Public Works may require other Users as well as Significant Industrial Users to obtain
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
C. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set forth in this Chapter.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all
Federal and State pretreatment standards or requirements and local limits or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law.
13.12.505 – Wastewater analysis
When requested by the Director of Public Works, a User shall submit information on the nature and characteristics
of its wastewater within thirty (30) days of the request. The Director of Public Works is authorized to prepare a

or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
User subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Director of Public Works a
report containing the information described in Section 13.12.615. For Users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the User's long-term production rate. For all other Users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.12.550.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
50
13.12.615 – Periodic compliance reports
A. All Significant Industrial Users shall, at a frequency determined by the Director of Public Works but in no
case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports
shall be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.12.550.
B. Such reports shall contain:
1. Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in
gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
2. Measurement of Pollutants.
a. The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.
b. The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass,
where required by the standard or by the Director of Public Works, of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average
concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative
of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in Section
13.12.645.
c. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with procedures set out in Section 13.12.650.
3. Certification. A statement, reviewed by the User's authorized representative and certified by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis,
and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
C. All wastewater samples shall be representative of the User's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the
User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
D. If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the Director of Public Works, using the procedures prescribed in Section 13.12.650, the results
of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
13.12.620 – Reports of changed conditions
Each User shall notify the Director of Public Works of any planned significant changes to the User's operations or
system which might alter the nature, character, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the
change.
A. The Director of Public Works may require the User to submit such information as may be deemed necessary
to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application
under Section 13.12.540.
B. The Director of Public Works may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.12.570 or modify
an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.12.580 in response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.
C. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty
percent (20%) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.

51
13.12.625 – Reports of potential problems
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine,
episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the
POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and notify the Director of Public Works of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the User.
B. Within ten (10 days) following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Director of Public Works,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed pursuant to St. Charles Municipal Code.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
13.12.630 – Reports from unpermitted users
All Users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director of
Public Works as the Director of Public Works may require.
13.12.635 – Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting
If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User shall notify the Director of Public Works within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. The User is not required to resample if the Director of Public Works monitors at the User's
facility at least once a month, or if the Director of Public Works samples between the User's initial sampling and
when the User receives the results of this sampling unless the Director of Public Works requires otherwise.
13.12.645 – Analytical requirements
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in
Sections 13.12.400, 13.12.430, 13.12.460 and 13.12.600 shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto or any other test procedures approved by the Administrator.
13.12.650 – Sample collection
A. Except as indicated in Paragraph B, below, the User shall collect wastewater samples using flow
proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
Director of Public Works may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab
samples where the User demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge
limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds
shall be obtained using grab collection techniques. A minimum of four (4) grab samples are required.
13.12.655 – Timing
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date received.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
52
13.12.660 – Record keeping
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of
such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. Such records shall be retained and made
available for a period of at least three (3) years. Such period shall be automatically extended for the duration of
any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the Director of Public Works.
13.12.670 – Falsification
Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or General and/or
Supplemental Wastewater Discharge Permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall be subject to the penalties and costs provided in
Section 13.12.750 and shall in addition be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1000.00) or shall be incarcerated in a penal institution other than the
penitentiary for a period not to exceed six (6) months.
13.12.690 – Confidential information
Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director of Public Works' inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
State law. Any such request shall be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When
requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for
uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by
40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
53
13.12.700 – Public notification of significant non-compliance
The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the City, a list of
the Users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or
more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-(6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
B. Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or
more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six- (6-)month period equals
or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria
(1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other discharge violation that the Director of Public Works believes has caused, alone or in combination
with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or
the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or
has resulted in the Director of Public Works' exercise of his or her emergency authority to halt or prevent
such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained
in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline
monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s) which the Director of Public Works determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the City pretreatment program.
13.12.705 – Notice of violation
When the Director of Public Works or his/her authorized designee finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works or designee may serve upon that User a
written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
by the User to the Director of Public Works. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority
of the Director of Public Works to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
13.12.710 – Consent orders
The Director of Public Works or his/her authorized designee may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 13.12.720 and 13.12.725 and shall be judicially
enforceable. Issuance of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
54
13.12.715 – Show cause hearing
The Director of Public Works may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Director of Public Works and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least three (3) days prior to the hearing, unless the Director
of Public Works determines an emergency exists and less time is warranted. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the User. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the User.
13.12.720 – Compliance orders
When the Director of Public Works finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing
that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize
the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User
of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
13.12.725 – Cease and desist orders
When the Director of Public Works or his/her authorized designee finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public
Works may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
55
13.12.730 – Administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty
A. When the Director of Public Works finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Director of Public Works may upon agreement of the User, enter an order of administrative
settlement in lieu of civil penalty against such User in an amount not to exceed $1000.00. Such settlements
shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, administrative settlements in lieu of civil penalty shall be assessed for each day during the
period of violation.
B. Users desiring to dispute such settlements shall file a written request for the Director of Public Works to
reconsider the administrative settlements in lieu of civil penalty along with full payment of the administrative
settlement in lieu of civil penalty amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the administrative
settlement in lieu of civil penalty. Where a request has merit, the Director of Public Works may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the User's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The Director of Public Works may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the administrative settlement in lieu of
civil penalty.
C. Issuance of an administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
13.12.735 – Emergency suspensions
The Director of Public Works or his/her authorized designee may immediately suspend a User's discharge, after
informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare
of persons. The Director of Public Works or designee may also immediately suspend a User's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
A. Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the
event of a User's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director of Public
Works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection,
to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Director of Public Works may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in Section 13.12.740 are initiated against the User.
B. A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public Works prior to the date of any show cause or
termination hearing under Sections 13.12.715 or 13.12.740.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this
section.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
56
13.12.740 – Termination of discharge
In addition to the provisions in Section 13.12.585, any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
A. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics
prior to discharge;
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
or
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in Sections 13.12.410, 13.12.420 and 13.12.430.
Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show
cause under Section 13.12.715 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Director of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the User.
13.12.745 – Injunctive relief
When the Director of Public Works finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Director of Public Works may petition the Circuit Court through the City's Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities
of the User. The Director of Public Works may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
13.12.750 – Civil penalties/penalties and costs
Any User who is found to have violated an order of the City Council or who has failed to comply with any provision
of this chapter, any rules and regulations, permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not less
than five dollars ($5.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1000.00). For the purpose of this section, each day
in which any such violation shall occur or continue, shall be deemed a separate violation, and a separate violation
shall be deemed to have occurred for each constituent found to exceed the limits established in this chapter
during any such day. For each separate violation, each such person shall be fined an amount not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1000.00). In addition to the penalties provided in this Chapter, the City may recover
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit
against the person found to have violated this chapter or the rules, regulations, permits or orders issued
hereunder.

13.12.755 – Criminal prosecution
A. A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty
of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1000.00 per violation, or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a
separate violation.
B. A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or
property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more
than $1000.00, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a
violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate violation. This penalty shall be in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.
C. A User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application,
record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished
by a fine of not more than $1000.00 per violation, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
D. In the event of a second conviction, a User shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1000.00 per
violation, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation occurs or
continues shall be deemed a separate violation.
13.12.760 – Remedies nonexclusive
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Director of Public Works may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally
be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan; provided, however, the Director of Public Works may
take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director of Public Works is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant User.
13.12.770 – Performance bonds
The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any User who has
failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such User first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the City, in a form and of a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director of Public Works to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
13.12.777 – Liability insurance
The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any User who has
failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the User first submits proof that it has
obtained liability insurance or provides financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair any damage to the
POTW it may cause by its discharge.
13.12.780 – Water supply severance
Whenever a User has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the User may be
severed. Service will only recommence, at the User's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to
comply.

58
13.12.783 – Public nuisances
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the Director of Public Works. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating,
or remedying said nuisance.
13.12.785 – Disqualification contractor listing
Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements may not be
eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City.
13.12.786 – Disconnect notice fee
If it is determined that a notice of disconnection of service shall be issued to a customer due to utility charges
being over 30 days past due, a payment being returned unpaid by a bank, a deposit not being paid by the due
date, and/or a violation of the terms of this Code, an additional fee (a disconnect notice fee) will be charged. This
fee will escalate based on the number of disconnect notices previously issued to the customer in the last twelve
months. The disconnect notice fee schedule is $20.00 for the first notice, $35.00 for the second notice and $50.00
for any subsequent notices.
(2011-M-32 : § 1)
13.12.787 – Right of cut-off service - Reconnection procedure for non-payment
A. The City shall have the right to discontinue any utility service provided to the customer on due notice and to
remove its property from the customer’s premises whenever monthly City bills, or a portion thereof, remain
unpaid for 30 days after the due date specified, or in case the customer fails to comply with, or perform, any
of the conditions or obligations of this chapter.
(Ord. 2010-M-4 § 1.)
B. A customer’s service so discontinued shall be connected after the customer has made settlement for City
utility bills in arrears, plus any current amount outstanding at the City Clerk’s office, or has, to the City’s
satisfaction, complied with or performed such other conditions or obligations which were in default, as the
case may be. A minimum fee shall be charged equal to two times one and one-half the midpoint of the wage
rate for a meter technician at the time of reconnection. In the event the City incurs expense for labor in
excess of the average cost of reconnection, the City may charge that additional cost for disconnection and
reconnection to the customer.

59
13.12.788 – Lien rights
A. Whenever a bill for sewer service, including any charge, penalty or fine pursuant to this chapter, remains
unpaid sixty days after is has been rendered, the City Attorney shall file with the Recorder of Deeds of the
appropriate county a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain a legal description of the premises
served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the City claims a lien for such amount as well as for
all charges for sewer service subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
B. If the customer whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises, the City Clerk shall notify the owner of
the premises if his address is known to the Clerk, whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of ninety
days after it has been rendered.
C. The failure of the City Attorney to record such lien claim or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner to
receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid sewer bills mentioned in
subsection D of this Section.
D. Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer service charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and
the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity or other appropriate proceeding in
the name of the City. The City Attorney is authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name
of the City in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill for sewer
service has remained unpaid ninety days after it has been rendered.
13.12.790 – Affirmative defense - Upset
A. For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance
with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
3. The User has submitted the following information to the Director of Public Works within twenty-four
(24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission
shall be provided within five (5) days:

general prohibitions in Section 13.12.400 or the specific prohibitions in Sections 12.12.410, 13.12.420, and
13.12.430 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in compliance with each limit directly prior
to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's
prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
13.12.799 – Bypass
A. A User may allow any User Bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements
to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. Such User
Bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section.
B.
1. If a User knows in advance of the need for a User Bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director of

13.12.940 – Control manhole device and sampling requirements - Location,
construction, maintenance and facility monitoring
A. When required by the Director of Public Works, the owner and/or occupant of any property served by a
building sanitary sewer carrying industrial waste shall install a suitable control manhole in the building
sanitary sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when
required, shall include but not be limited to being accessible, safely located, and provide for 110 volt hookup
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director of Public Works. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner and/or occupant at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be
safe and accessible to the City at all times.
B. When in the judgment of the Director of Public Works there exists sufficient volumes and/or quantities of
contaminants that may interfere with the performance of the City sewage system, the Director of Public
Works may require the owner and/or occupant of any property and/or an Industrial User served by a building
sanitary sewer carrying industrial wastes to install composite sampling equipment and/or flow measurement
equipment. Said composite sampling and flow measurement equipment shall be installed by the property
owner and/or occupant at its expense and shall be maintained by it as to be functional at all times, safe and
accessible to the City.
C. The owner and/or occupant shall be responsible for monitoring its effluent to insure that its discharge meets
City chapters, state and federal law. It is also responsible for having knowledge of the contaminants in its
wastewater and the specific limitations relative to its discharge. Records shall be kept by the owner and/or
occupant of the results of all sampling and/or flow measurements. Such documentation shall be available to
appropriate City personnel at all reasonable times. Records shall be kept by the owner and/or occupant no
less than three years or longer if required by state or federal laws prior to discard or if an enforcement action
is pending.
D. Where composite sampling equipment is available, the City shall utilize such composite samples for
purposes of calculating surcharges pursuant to Section 13.12.810. The average of all composite samples
during the monitoring period shall be used to determine the multiplier. Should the composite sampling
equipment malfunction or if it does not exist, the City shall use composited grab samples of not less than four
aliquots in a 24 hour period, unless the User agrees to less than four grab samples in a 24 hour period, to
determine surcharges as set forth in Section 13.12.810. The average of all grab samples taken by the City
during the billing period shall be used for the multiplier. Where nonfunctional composite equipment exists
and at such time that a grab sample exceeds the limitations specified in Section 13.12.400 hereof for total
suspended solids, C.B.O.D., ammonia, phosphorous or grease, the City and waste generator shall split grab
samples no less than five samples per week until the composite sampler is once again functional. Should
the composite sampler become functional prior to the end of the billing period, composite samples shall be
taken no less than five per week for the remainder of the billing period for computing the average of the grab
and composite samples to determine the billing multiplier. The Director of Public Works shall decide the time
when split sampling will be taken. Should there be a significant discrepancy between the owner's and/or
occupant's test results and the City's test results on split samples, the owner and/or occupant may request
billing to be based upon testing results from an independent testing laboratory. Upon investigation by the
Director of Public Works as to the reasons for the discrepancy in sample results, the Director of Public Works
shall take appropriate corrective actions and/or authorize in writing the terms of using a certified independent
testing laboratory. The choice of independent laboratory shall be at the discretion of the Director of Public
Works. All expenses incurred for monitoring by an independent certified laboratory shall be at the expense
of the owner and/or occupant.
E. In the event that no special manhole is available, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
downstream manhole in the public sewer nearest to the point at which the building sanitary sewer is
connected.
F. Should the Director of Public Works find violations of standards set forth in this Chapter including Section
13.12.410, Section 13.12.420, and/or Section 13.12.430, the Director of Public Works may require the owner
and/or occupant to provide access for the use of laboratory testing equipment or to contract for laboratory
testing services and provide the City with a copy of the test results of the constituent(s) monitored. Upon
review of the products and by products of the owner and/or occupant operation and the type of wastewater
that is indigenous to the operation, the Director of Public Works shall also stipulate what constituents are to
be monitored to insure proper performance by the City sewerage system in compliance with this Chapter,
state and federal law.
G. Where nonfunctional or malfunctioning flow measurement equipment exists, the waste generator and/or
Industrial User shall notify the Director of Public Works within twenty-four hours of his or her knowledge of
the malfunction so appropriate interim measurement arrangements can be made.

13.22.001 – Purpose and scope
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and procedures for constructing facilities on
rights-of-way within the City’s jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation
of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the City rights-of-way and the City as a whole.
B. Intent. In enacting this Chapter, the City intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the City
and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
1. prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and
places;
2. prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
3. prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the City’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully
located in rights-of-way or public property;
4. protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility
facilities;
5. protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase
impermeable surfaces;
6. preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed;
7. preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the City’s
residential neighborhoods;
8. prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and
9. assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.
C. Facilities Subject to This Chapter. This Chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the City. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this Chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility
as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license
or similar agreement.
D. Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The City, in its discretion and as limited by law, may
require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the City rights-of-way. Utilities that are not
required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the City enter into such an agreement. In
such an agreement, the City may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this Chapter.
E. Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
1. Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event that a utility other than a
telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the City, such
franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful
renewal or extension thereof.
2. Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the
provisions of this Chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between
the City
and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement
shall
govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
F. Conflicts with Other Chapters. This Chapter supersedes all Chapters or parts of Chapters adopted
prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
G. Conflicts with State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable federal or State laws or
regulations conflict with the requirements of this Chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of
this Chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or State laws or regulations.
H. Sound Engineering Judgment. The City shall use sound engineering judgment when administering
this Chapter and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter when the
City so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to regulate its rightsofway
for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

1. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer
shall notify the City that it intends to commence work governed by this Chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and other
documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided
by the telecommunications retailer to the City not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon
which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
2. In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide such specification of location to the
telecommunications retailer within either (i) ten (10) days after service of notice to the City by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or (ii)
twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work
without obtaining a permit under this Chapter.
3. Upon the provision of such specification by the City, where a permit is required for work pursuant to
Section 13.22.004 of this Chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the City an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available regarding
the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of Subsection A.
herein.
C. Additional City Review of Applications of Holders of State Authorization Under the Cable and Video
Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the
Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days after submission to
the City, unless otherwise acted upon by the City, provided the holder has complied with all applicable City
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
13.22.006 – Effect of permit
A. Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit issued by the City authorizes a
permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this Chapter on City rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may
have an interest in the rights-of-way.
B. Duration. No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
C. Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this
Chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform
any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a
date, time and place designated by the City with such City representatives in attendance as the City deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence
or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property
owners.
D. Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the City does not excuse the permittee
from complying with other requirements of the City and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations.

114
13.22.007 – Revised permit drawings
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in
the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised
set of drawings or plans to the City within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations
approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with Section 13.22.021 of this Chapter. If the City denies the
request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
Title 13 - Public Utilities
115
13.22.008 – Insurance
A. Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement,
each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain
the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the City, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed
in paragraphs 1 and 2 below:
1. Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and
underground hazard (commonly referred to as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products-completed
operations coverage with limits not less than:
a. Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to each person;
b. Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting from any one accident; and
c. Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of liability.

million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury and property damage for each accident;
3. Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
4. Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per
employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the
work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
B. Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section may be in any combination of primary,
excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying
insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the
limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
C. Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this Section to the City
within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
D. Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies required by this Section shall
contain the following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be
stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to
said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section. In the event that the utility fails to obtain or produce evidence of
said replacement insurance, any permits issued pursuant to this Chapter shall, without any further notice, be
null and void.
E. Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements
required by Subsection A. herein. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such selfinsurance,
to comply with Subsections A, B, C, and D of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under Subsection A herein, such as evidence that the utility is a
“private self insurer” under the Workers Compensation Act.
F. Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s Liability. The legal liability of the utility to the City and any
person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this
Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts
thereunder.
G. Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and
enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business in the State of Illinois. All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by the A.M.

and hold the City and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses,
including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise
out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or
its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy
of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided,
however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of
this Chapter by the City, its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents or representatives.
13.22.010 – Security
A. Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this
Section. The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the
permittee’s sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The Security
Fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this Chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by the permittee’s failure to comply
with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to
this Chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the City may
pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this Chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required to perform pursuant to this Chapter and that the City must perform itself or have completed as
a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the
City from the permittee pursuant to this Chapter or any other applicable law, franchise, license or
agreement.
B. Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the form, at the permittee’s election, of
cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable
to the City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide for the notification to the City at least sixty (60) days prior to expiration; and
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the City of any amounts covered by it;
and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn;
and
4. Be irrevocable; and
Run solely to the benefit of the City; and
Provide that the company issuing the financial instrument shall satisfy the City’s rating criteria, as
applicable:
banks (for letters of credit, bonds): Prudent Man Analysis, Inc, rating of 1, 2, or 3 (or equivalent); or
Insurance Companies (for surety bonds): A M Best Company rating of Superior (A++ and A+),
Excellent (A and A-), Very Good (B++ and B+) (or equivalent),
C. Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated
cost plus 15% to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works or his designee, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails
to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed
in phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one
location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be
applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this Subsection (C) for any single phase.
D. Withdrawals. The City, upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its
Title 13 - Public Utilities
117
intention to, exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security
Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the fourteen (14) day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the City has been
compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the City determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
E. Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the City that any amount has
been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount
specified in Subsection C of this Section.
F. Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be
returned to the permittee by the City, upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any
such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection C of
this Section.
G. Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the City for failure by
the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the
City as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall
be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all
other rights of the City, whether reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the City may
have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with
respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

C. Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Director of Public Works may authorize a variance only if the utility
requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular rightof-
way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from
which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the Director of
Public Works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this Chapter but which carry out the purposes of this
Chapter.
E. Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial
of a variance, made by the Director of Public Works under the provisions of this Chapter shall have the right
to appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application for
appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of the appeal at
the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the

shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 nor more than $750 for each such violation, and a separate offense
shall be deemed committed for each and every day during which a violation continues or exists. There may be
times when the City will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or
cannot perform its duties pursuant to its permit and this Chapter. Unless the utility demonstrates that another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of
the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost
apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs so apportioned.
13.22.023 – Enforcement
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the City may have for
enforcement of this Chapter.
13.22.024 – Severability
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof."

Chapter 16.08, “Subdivision Standards and Specifications” when the Plan Commission finds that there is
compliance with the following standards:
A. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other
property;
B. Because of the shape, topography, or other physical conditions of the proposed subdivision or its
surroundings, a) a hardship or practical difficulty would be caused by strict compliance with these
requirements, and/or b) the purposes of these requirements would be served to a greater extent by an
alternative design;
C. The conditions upon which the variance request is based are unique to the proposed subdivision and are
not generally applicable to other property;
D. The variance granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land;

complying with this Title, follows sound engineering practices.
16.04.040 – Special subdivision procedures
A. Combined Preliminary-Final Review Process
At the Subdivider’s request, the City will conduct a simultaneous review of both the Preliminary Plat of
Subdivision and Final Plat of Subdivision applications. The Subdivider will not be required to submit
separate plans for the two applications. The Subdivider needs only to submit the number of plans required
for the Final Plat of Subdivision application, but shall submit all required information and fees as detailed in
the Preliminary Plat of Subdivision, Preliminary Engineering Plan, Final Plat of Subdivision, and Final
Engineering Plan application checklists. The Subdivider shall submit such request to the City in a written
letter.
B. Minor Subdivision
A Minor Subdivision shall not require submittal of a Preliminary Plat of Subdivision application prior to
submittal of a Final Plat of Subdivision application, nor shall it require the submittal of Preliminary or Final
Engineering Plans. A subdivision meeting all of the following criteria shall be considered a Minor
Subdivision:
1. The subdivision fully conforms to the requirements of Chapter 16.08, “Subdivision Standards and
Specifications”.
2. The subdivision will create no more than four (4) lots.
3. No extension/creation of public improvements is required to serve the subdivision, including
streets/rights-of-way or utilities.

public utilities located in and adjacent to the right-of-way, or at another location on each lot.
5. No on-site or offsite stormwater detention/retention facilities are required to serve the subdivision.
6. All lots meet the minimum size and dimension requirements of the applicable zoning district contained
in Title 17, “Zoning” of the St. Charles Municipal Code.
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement
6
16.04.050 – Pre-application meeting
A. The pre-application meeting provides an opportunity for Subdividers to informally discuss the concept of the
proposed development, and to receive preliminary nonbinding feedback regarding proposed zoning,
possible variations/variances from zoning and subdivision requirements, utilities and drainage, traffic and
parking, building and fire prevention code requirements, building aesthetics, landscaping, review
procedures, and the information and studies that will be needed to evaluate the project. The pre-application
meeting does not require a formal application or filing fee. A pre-application meeting is optional but
encouraged for all applications.
B. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to help Subdividers to determine:
1. Whether the proposed development generally appears to be in compliance with the provisions of this
Title and other applicable ordinances.
2. Whether any zoning amendment, variation, special use or other application may be required in
connection with the proposed development.
3. Whether the proposed development will be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and other
adopted goals and policies of the City for development.
16.04.060 – Concept plan
A. Application
The Subdivider may request review of a Concept Plan by submitting an application to the Director of
Community Development.
B. Purpose
The purpose of the Concept Plan Review is to enable the Subdivider to obtain informal guidance from the
Plan Commission and City Council Committee at an early stage, before preparing more detailed preliminary
and final plans.
C. Review
Because the information submitted for a Concept Plan is not complete enough to determine compliance with
all applicable requirements, the Plan Commission and City Council Committee shall not vote to recommend
approval or denial. Affirmative comments shall not bind the City to approve a Preliminary or Final Plat of
Subdivision submitted at a later stage, nor shall negative comments prevent the Subdivider from submitting
applications for approval of Preliminary and Final Plat of Subdivision.
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement

Council approval. At the end of the two year period the City Council, at its discretion and for good
cause, may be extended, for up to one (1) year at a time. If a Final Plat of Subdivision is approved and
recorded encompassing all or any phase of the land included on the Preliminary Plat of Subdivision,
the Preliminary Plat of Subdivision as to the balance shall remain valid for a period of five years from
the date of its initial approval.

(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.080 – Criteria for requiring a cash contribution in lieu of park and school land
A. When Cash Contribution Required
When the subdivision is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when available land is
inappropriate for park or school sites, or when park or school sites have already been provided, the City Council
may require the payment of cash contributions in lieu of the required land. The City Council shall determine
whether land or cash will be required when it approves the Preliminary Plat, and shall consider the
recommendation of the appropriate Park or School District in making such determinations. The Park or School
District may refuse a land donation based upon the following criteria:
1. The land is not needed in the proposed location for the type of dedication site being proposed.
2. The configuration of the site, location within the development, size of the site, or function of the property
(wetland, rolling topography, detention, retention) is not appropriate, based on the district’s needs for site or
facilities in the area of the subdivision.
3. Access to the site is not conducive to use of the site as public land.
When the Park District or School District has refused a land contribution based on these criteria, the City Council
shall require a cash contribution.
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement
25
B. Payment of Park Contribution
For subdivisions platted in multiple phases, the per dwelling unit cash contribution in lieu of, or in addition to, park
land, as may be applicable, shall be paid for the entire phase to be developed, prior to issuance of the first
building permit for the applicable phase. For subdivisions platted in a single phase, the per dwelling unit cash
contribution in lieu of, or in addition to, park land, as may be applicable, shall be paid for the entire subdivision
prior to issuance of the first building permit. The applicable per dwelling unit cash contribution shall be paid
directly to the Park District and held in a segregated account. All such payments made to the Park District under
this Section are to be spent solely in accordance with paragraph 3 below. The City shall not issue a building
permit until it receives an original receipt of payment executed by the treasurer of the Park District.
C. Use of Contribution by Park District
1. The cash contribution in lieu of park land shall be used solely for the acquisition of park land which will serve
the immediate or future needs of the residents of the subdivision for which the contribution was received, or the
improvement of existing park land which will serve such needs; provided, however, any expenditure of funds for
land or improvements shall satisfy all applicable statutory criteria.
2. For subdivisions for which a combination of land dedication and cash contribution has been received, the
Park District shall spend a portion of the cash contribution to improve the land dedication site within the
subdivision, with the improvements to be determined by the Park District. For subdivisions platted within the City
limits, the Park District shall spend one hundred percent (100%) of the contribution within the City limits; for
subdivision platted outside the City limits but within the planning jurisdiction of the City, the Park District shall
spend one hundred percent (100%) of the contribution within the planning jurisdiction of the City. The City Council
may vary the requirements of this paragraph 2 if it finds that, based upon facts presented by the Park District, such
variance will result in park facilities which will serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of the
subdivision from which the contribution was received.
D. Payment of School Contribution
For subdivisions platted in multiple phases, the per dwelling unit cash contribution in lieu of, or in addition to,
school land, as may be applicable, shall be paid for the entire phase to be developed, prior to issuance of the first
building permit for the applicable phase. For subdivisions platted in a single phase, the per dwelling unit cash
contribution in lieu of, or in addition to, school land, as may be applicable, shall be paid for the entire subdivision
prior to issuance of the first building permit. The applicable per dwelling unit cash contribution shall be paid
directly to the School District and held in a segregated account. All such payments made to the School District
under this Section are to be spent solely in accordance with paragraph 5 below. The City shall not issue a
building permit until it receives an original receipt of payment executed by the treasurer of the School District.
E. Use of Contribution by School District The cash contribution in lieu of school land shall be used solely for the
acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents from the subdivision for
which the contribution was received, or for the improvement of any existing school site which will serve such
needs provided, however, any expenditure of funds for school sites or improvements shall satisfy all applicable
statutory criteria.
F. Return of Contribution if not Expended
If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park or school site land is not expended for the purposes set forth
herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded, together with accrued interest thereon, to
the owners of record of all lots, except public land, in the subdivision for which such contribution is made. The
refund shall be paid to the person who is the owner of record on the day which is the tenth anniversary of the
receipt of such contribution. The amount of the refund due to each lot owner shall be equal to the amount of the
original contribution, together with accrued interest thereon, divided by the total number of lots in the subdivision
(excluding public land) for which the contribution
was made. The City Council may permit one- year extensions of the ten-year restriction if the Park District or
School District demonstrates that such funds have been allocated for an acquisition or improvement allowed
herein, but have not been spent due to additional funds being necessary to complete such acquisition or
improvement.
G. Amount Applicable at Payment
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement
26
All building permits issued shall be subject to the cash contributions applicable pursuant to Title 16 at the time of
payment of the cash contributions, unless otherwise previously granted by the City Council through a planned unit
development or annexation agreement. Any amendment to an approved Preliminary Plat, Final Plat of
Subdivision, or Planned Unit Development shall require compliance with the then applicable cash in-lieu fees, to
the extent that such amendment results in the calculation of a greater cash payment to the Park District and
School District.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.090 – Amount of cash contribution
The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of improved land within the
subdivision, which shall be defined as the value of land with roads, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm and sanitary
sewer, water and other utilities. The fair market value of improved land for subdivisions to be developed within the
City is hereby determined to be two hundred forty thousand five hundred dollars ($240,500.00) per acre, which
shall be used in the calculation of the required cash contributions, except as follows:
1. The fair market value for subdivisions to be developed outside the corporate limits of the City of St. Charles
but within the City's 1 1/2 mile jurisdictional area is hereby determined to be one hundred seventy-five
thousand dollars ($175,000).
2. If the Subdivider files a written objection to the use of the per acre value established herein, he shall submit
an appraisal. Such appraisal shall show the fair market value of improved land in the area of the subdivision.
The City shall notify the School District and the Park District of any objection and shall provide the School
District and the Park District at least ninety (90) days to file their own appraisal or other response as they
determine appropriate.
3. If the City Council determines that the specifics of the subdivision so warrant, it may require an appraisal.
Final determination of the fair market value per acre of land shall be made by the City Council, based upon
the appraisal or appraisals, and upon other information which may be submitted by the Park District, School
District, or others. The Subdivider shall pay all appraisal fees.
4. At least once every five (5) years, but not more often than every three (3) years, the City, in cooperation with
the Park District and School District shall obtain an appraisal and review and if appropriate, adjust the value
of land under this Ordinance. The City shall notify the School District and the Park District at the
commencement of the process. In determining whether it is appropriate to adjust the value of land under this
ordinance, the City shall consider whether the land value is within the range of values set by other area
municipalities, including those municipalities served by the Park and School Districts.
5. Any appraisal submitted under this section shall be prepared by a licensed Illinois State Real Estate
Appraiser and shall be in the form of a report that conforms to the applicable requirements of the Uniform
Standards of Professional Practice.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement

16.10.100 – Criteria for requiring land and cash
There may be situations when a combination of land and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. At
the time of Preliminary Plat approval, the City Council may require a combination of land and cash in any of the
following situations:
A. When a previously designated park or school site lies partly within and partly outside of a proposed
subdivision and the acreage of the designated park or school site within the subdivision is less than the park or
school site acreage required herein, the subdivider shall contribute all of the designated park or school site lying
within the proposed subdivision, and cash in lieu of the additional acreage needed to fulfill the requirements
hereof.
B. When part of a designated park or school site has already been acquired, and the land needed to complete it
is less than the land required from the subdivision, then the subdivider shall contribute the amount of land needed
from the subdivision to complete the park or school site and cash in lieu of the additional acreage needed to fulfill
the requirements hereof.
C. When the subdivider will be contributing certain park or school sites, and the balance of the required park or
school site acreage would be too small or otherwise unsuitable for park or school sites, then the subdivider shall
contribute cash in lieu of the balance of the required school or park site acreage.

The “Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit” shall be used to calculate the amount of required
park and school site land and cash contributions in lieu thereof. It is recognized that population density, age
distribution, and local conditions change over time, and that, therefore, the table is subject to periodic review and
amendment as necessary.
B. Objection
A written objection to “The Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit” may be filed by the
Subdivider, or by the School or Park District, prior to City Council approval of the Preliminary Plat. The City shall
notify the School District and the Park District of any objection and shall provide the School District and Park
District at least ninety (90) days to file their own response. Such objection shall include a demographic study
showing the estimated ultimate population to be generated by the subdivision. Final determination of the
estimated ultimate population shall be made by the City
Council at the time of Preliminary Plat approval.
C. Credit for Existing Lots and Dwellings
A credit to the estimated population shall be granted as follows:
1. Existing Subdivided Lots: Lots previously subdivided for residential use, pursuant to a Subdivision Plat
previously approved by the City of St. Charles and previously recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds,
shall receive a credit calculated as a reduction of one residential unit per existing subdivided lot located
wholly within the proposed subdivision.
2. Existing Lots of Record: Portions of previously subdivided lots that were lawfully conveyed as Lots of
Record prior to September 17, 2012, provided said Lots of Record meet the minimum lot width and area
requirements of the applicable zoning district in which it is located, shall receive a credit calculated as a
reduction of one residential unit per existing Lot of Record located wholly within the proposed subdivision.
Title 16 - Subdivisions and Land Improvement
29
3. Existing Residential Dwellings: Existing residential dwellings shall receive a credit calculated as a reduction
of the estimated population for the dwelling based upon the formulas within this chapter. A credit shall not be
granted under sections 1 and 2 above for any lot receiving a credit for an existing dwelling under this
section.
D. Institutional Uses
A “Nursing Home” or “Assisted Living Facility”, as defined in Title 17 of the City Code, and similar institutional
uses, shall not be considered residential dwellings, and therefore units or rooms within such facilities shall not be
included in the calculation of estimated population.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.120 – Reservation of land
A. Park or school dedication sites shall be considered public land for purposes of this chapter. All dedication
sites shall be designated as a lot on the Final Plat of Subdivision. The lot shall be identified as a park or school
site, with a notation that the property is to be conveyed as public land in accordance with this Title.
B. Whenever the St. Charles Comprehensive Plan, or the standards of the City, School District, or Park District
call for a school or park site within a subdivision larger than the required land contribution, the land needed in
addition to the required contribution shall be reserved on the final plat for subsequent purchase by the City, Park
District, or School District. The City, Park District, or School District shall acquire the land so designated by
purchase or commence proceedings to acquire such land by condemnation within one year from the date of
recording of the final plat; if the land is not so acquired or condemnation proceedings are not so commenced
within said one year period, the land so designated may then be used by the owners thereof in any other
manner consistent with the St. Charles Municipal Code and compatible with said subdivision.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.130 – Condition of park and school sites
Land Improvements within the subdivision adjoining park and school sites shall be provided and paid for by the
Subdivider. In addition, park and school sites shall be fine graded, provided with a minimum of six (6) inches of
topsoil, and seeded as part of the required land improvements, unless otherwise permitted by the City Council. All
land improvements within the boundaries of park and school sites shall be completed prior to conveyance of the
site. Installation of adjacent parkway improvements (including sidewalks, parkway trees, and street lighting) may
be deferred until construction of the adjacent street is completed.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.140 – Time of conveyance
The park and school sites required herein shall be conveyed to the appropriate park or School District grantee
following the recording of the Final Plat of Subdivision. The timing of the conveyance shall be mutually agreed to
by the City, School or Park District, and the Subdivider, with due consideration for the project phasing and
construction activity to occur on properties adjacent to the school or park site. In the event the Subdivider has not
conveyed the school or park site in accordance with the agreed to timing of conveyance, the City may withhold the
issuance of building permits for residential units within the subdivision.

against the park or school site which is conveyed, shall be the responsibility and obligation of the grantor. Grantor
shall furnish evidence of payment of these taxes or deposit the amount of those taxes in escrow with the title
company furnishing the preliminary report of title, requiring payment of the taxes when they become due. After
payment of the taxes, evidence of such payment shall be furnished to the grantee. The amount of any general real
estate taxes and/or agricultural rollback taxes for the year of conveyance shall be pro-rated to the date of the
delivery of deed. The amount of the general real estate and agricultural rollback taxes shall be based on the
assessor's latest known rate, value, and equalizer, if any, for the land being conveyed.
(2018-M-29 : § 2)
16.10.160 – Real estate conveyance requirements
All real estate conveyed to the School District or Park District pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is hereby
designated “public land”. The Subdivider shall furnish the grantee with a survey of the public land to be conveyed
and a commitment for title insurance from a title company licensed to do business in the state of Illinois, in the
amount of the fair market value of such public land. If within thirty (30) days of receipt of the commitment, the
grantee objects in writing to defects in the title, the Subdivider shall have thirty (30) additional days from the date
of delivery of such written objections to cure such defects. All deeds of conveyance pursuant to this ordinance
shall be recorded, at the Subdivider’s sole expense, in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county in question.
All conveyances pursuant to this chapter shall
be accompanied by an appropriate affidavit of title, and shall be by warranty or trustee’s deed subject only to the
following:
A. Acts done or suffered by or judgments against the grantee, its successors and assigns;
B. General taxes for the year of conveyance, and subsequent years;

17.02.030 – Applicability and Interpretation
A. Territorial Application This Title shall apply to all development and use, public or private, within the corporate limits of the City of St. Charles, unless specifically exempted in this Title.
B. Zoning of Annexed Land Unless requested otherwise, land being annexed shall automatically be zoned RE-1 Single Family Estate District upon annexation.
C. Minimum Requirements The provisions of this Title are the minimum requirements deemed necessary to carry out its stated purpose and intent.
D. Conflicting Provisions Where the provisions of this Title contain two or more conflicting requirements applicable to a lot or part thereof, the most restrictive requirement shall apply.
E. No Development Without Conformance Except as otherwise provided by this Title, no land, building, structure or part thereof shall be improved, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
moved, enlarged or structurally altered, used or occupied unless it conforms with the applicable provisions of this Title.
(Ord. 1960-16 § IV (A).)
F. Private Agreements This Title is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties. Where the provisions of this Title are
more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than a private agreement, the requirements of this Title shall govern. The City does not enforce or maintain a record of
private agreements.
G. Other Laws and Regulations If the provisions of this Title are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent
permitted by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or more stringent controls on development.
H. Meanings and Intent The language of the Title must be read literally. Regulations are no more or less strict than stated. Words defined in Chapter 17.30 and 17.32 have the specific
meaning assigned. Words that are not defined in Chapter 17.30 or 17.32 have the meaning given in the latest editions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, and if not defined therein,
Black’s Law Dictionary, or Webster’s Third International Dictionary, unless the context expressly indicates another meaning.
I. Tenses and Usage:
Words used in the singular include the plural. The reverse is also true.
Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The reverse is also true.
The words "must," "will," "shall" and "may not" are mandatory.
The word "may" is permissive, and "should" is advisory, not mandatory or required.
When used with numbers, "Up to X," "Not more than X," and "a maximum of X" all include X.
The masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter.
(Ord.1988-Z-8 § 1; Ord. 1960-16 III (part).)
J. Conjunctions
Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, conjunctions have the following meanings:
"And" indicates that all connected items or provisions apply; and
"Or" indicates that the connected items or provisions may apply singularly and in combination.
K. Fractions
1. Minimum Requirements When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any fractional result of 0.5 or more must be rounded up to the next consecutive whole
number. For example, if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 30 linear feet is applied to a 50-foot dimension, the resulting fraction of 1.67 is rounded up to 2 required
trees.
2. Maximum Limits When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole number. For example, if a
maximum limit of one dwelling unit for every 2,500 square feet is applied to a 6,250 square foot lot, the resulting fraction of 2.5 is rounded down to 2 (allowed dwelling units).
L. Headings and Illustrations Headings and illustrations are provided for convenience and reference only and do not define or limit the scope of any provision of this Title. In case of any
difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Title and any heading, drawing, table, figured, photograph, or illustration, the text controls.
M. References to Other Regulations All references in this Title to other city, county, state, or federal regulations are for informational purposes only, and do not constitute a complete list of
such regulations. These references do not imply any responsibility by the city for enforcement of county, state, or federal regulations.
N. Current Versions and Citations All references to other city, county, state, or federal regulations in this Title refer to the most current version and citation for those regulations, unless
expressly indicated otherwise. When the referenced regulations have been repealed and not replaced by other regulations, the requirements of this Title for compliance are no longer
in effect.
O. Lists and Examples Unless otherwise expressly indicated, lists of items or examples that use "including," "such as," or similar terms are intended to provide examples only. They are
not to be construed as exhaustive lists of all possibilities.
P. Delegation of Administrative Authority Whenever a provision appears requiring an officer or employee of the city to perform an act or duty, that provision shall be construed as
authorizing the officer or employee to delegate that responsibility to others over whom they have authority. Delegation of authority is not allowed when the provisions of this Title
expressly prohibit such a delegation.
Q. Public Officials and Agencies All employees, public officials, bodies, and agencies to which references are made are those of the City of St. Charles unless otherwise expressly stated.
R. Zoning of Property Outside of the City For the purposes of this Title, zoning of properties not within but adjoining the corporate limits of the City of St. Charles shall be deemed to be
characterized as the St. Charles zoning district that most closely approximates the uses and intensity of development permitted by the County or Municipal zoning regulations
applicable thereto, or the uses and intensity of development contemplated in the applicable Comprehensive Plan of the jurisdiction in which it is located, whichever is more intensive.

Chapter 17.08, Nonconformities.
(Ord. 1988-Z-8 § 1; Ord. 1960-16 § IV (D).)

application shall be reviewed and scheduled for consideration by the appropriate staff and review bodies.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 6.)

application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying its consideration. The Director of Community Development shall make a determination as to whether the
subsequent application is making essentially the same request. If the Director of Community Development finds that there are no grounds for consideration of the subsequent
application, he/she shall summarily, and without hearing, deny the request.
F. Dismissal of Dormant Applications

17.04.120 – Pre-application meeting
The Pre-Application Meeting provides an opportunity for applicants to informally discuss the concept of the proposed development, and to obtain feedback regarding proposed zoning,
possible Variations from zoning and subdivision requirements, utilities and drainage, traffic and parking, building and fire prevention code requirements, building aesthetics, landscaping,
review procedures, and the information and studies that will be needed to evaluate the project. The Pre-Application Meeting does not require formal application, fee or filing of an application.
The purpose of the Pre-Application Meeting is to help applicants to determine:
1. Whether the proposed development appears in general to be in compliance with the provisions of this Title and other applicable ordinances.
2. Whether any Zoning Amendment, Variation, Special Use or other application may be required in connection with the proposed development.
3. Whether the proposed development will be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted goals and policies of the City for development.
A Pre-Application meeting is required prior to submittal of an application for a Planned Unit Development, and is optional but encouraged for other types of applications. See Table 17.04-1.
17.04.130 – Neighborhood meeting
A. Purpose:
The purpose of the Neighborhood Meeting is to provide a forum for preliminary discussions between developers and nearby property owners who may be affected by a proposed
development or change in use.
B. Procedure:
Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to host a Neighborhood Meeting prior to submittal of an application for a Map Amendment, Special Use, or PUD that involves an increase
in density or intensity of use, or a change of use, compared to that which is permitted by the existing zoning. The applicant is encouraged to invite all adjacent property owners that will
be required to be notified for the public hearing, and to give them an opportunity to attend a meeting at a reasonable time and place. At the meeting, the applicant should provide
information regarding the proposed development or change in use and invite questions and comments from those in attendance. If an applicant hosts a Neighborhood Meeting, he
shall provide a written summary to the Director of Community Development indicating how many persons attended the meeting and a summary of the discussion.
17.04.140 – Concept plan review
A. Purpose:
The purpose of the Concept Plan review is to enable the applicant to obtain informal input from the Historic Preservation Commission (where applicable), Plan Commission and
Council Committee prior to spending considerable time and expense in the preparation of detailed plans and architectural drawings. It also serves as a forum for owners of neighboring
property to ask questions and express their concerns and views regarding the potential development. A Concept Plan Review shall be required prior to submittal of applications for a
new Planned Unit Development and certain applications for an amendment to an existing Planned Unit Development or a previously approved PUD Preliminary Plan, as specified in
section 17.04.410, PUD Review Process. A Concept Plan Review is optional for all other applications. See Table 17.04-1.
(Ord. 2009-Z-9 § 2.)
B. Concept Plan Procedure:
1. Application for Concept Plan Review
An application for a Concept Plan review shall be filed with the Director of Community Development and shall include the information, plans and data as specified in Appendix A
(Submittal Items). The Director of Community Development shall forward the application to the Plan Commission and the City Council Planning and Development Committee, or
other Council Committee, for review. If the property is within a Historic District or is a designated Landmark, or is within 250 feet of a Historic District or a designated Landmark,
the Director shall forward the application to the Historic Preservation Commission prior to the review by the Plan Commission.
2. Concept Plan Notice
Not less than 10 days prior to the Plan Commission meeting, the Director of Community Development shall mail a notice by first class mail to the owners of property within 250
feet of the proposed project site, excluding public rights of way. This notice shall include the date, time and place of the Plan Commission meeting where the Concept Plan is to
be reviewed, and shall include a general description of the proposed development. The information shall also be mailed to the park and school districts in which the property is
located, and to other persons or entities that may have jurisdiction over the project that the City desires to notify.
3. Review of Concept Plan
For properties within a Historic District and for designated Landmarks, and for properties within 250 feet of a Historic District or designated Landmark, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall review the Concept Plan and may comment regarding its potential impact on the historic resources of the City, particularly with regard to designated landmarks
and historic districts directly affected. The Plan Commission and the City Council Planning and Development Committee, or other City Council Committee, shall review the
Concept Plan and may comment regarding its compatibility with the official Comprehensive Plan, this Title and other applicable ordinances. Affirmative comments by the Plan
Commission, Historic Preservation Commission or City Council Committee do not necessarily indicate that a proposal will be approved during formal review, and do not obligate
the City Council or any of its appointed officials, boards or commissions to approve later applications or plans. Negative comments do not prohibit the petitioner from submitting
applications for formal public hearing and/or review by the Plan Commission and City Council. The applicant shall not be entitled to base any economic decisions regarding
acquisition or development of the property on affirmative or negative comments made during review of a Concept Plan by any City elected or appointed official.

(2008-Z-32 : § 11; 1981-Z-6 : § 1 (part))
17.04.220 – Sign permits
A. Permit Required
No sign, except those identified as exempt in Chapter 17.28, Signs, shall be erected, constructed, altered or relocated without first obtaining a permit. The Building and Code
Enforcement Division Manager shall only issue a permit to erect, construct, alter or relocate a sign if he finds that the proposed sign complies with the requirements of this Title and all

(2008-Z-32 : § 6)
17.04.230 – Design review
A. Purpose
Design Review is an administrative, staff-level review process, the purpose of which is to ensure that development and redevelopment occur in a manner that promotes the general welfare
of the City, is harmonious with surrounding properties, and is consistent with the City’s ordinances and Comprehensive Plan. Design Review requires conformance with standards and
guidelines governing physical layout and site design as well as architectural design, to achieve the following purposes:
1. To ensure the compatibility of buildings, structures, and site improvements with surrounding property.
2. To protect and enhance the character and quality of the built environment in St. Charles.
3. To ensure the efficient use of land and the adequacy of public and private services and utilities.
4. To minimize traffic and safety hazards and to ensure convenient and safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the site and in relation to adjacent property and public streets.
5. To protect natural, environmental, historic and archaeological resources on the site and surrounding areas.
6. To create opportunities for people to meet, interact, and enjoy their community.
B. When Required
Administrative Design Review approval shall be required prior to issuance of Building Permits and Site Development Permits for new buildings, building additions, exterior alterations, signs,
and site improvements such as paving, parking lots, lighting and grading, except in the following instances:
1. Design Review is not required for one and two family dwellings on individual lots in any RS Suburban Residential or RE Estate Residential zoning district.
2. Design Review is not required when the proposed construction includes no improvements, or only de minimus improvements, that are regulated by the Design Review Standards and
Guidelines (Chapter 17.06).
3. Planned Unit Developments: Conformance with the Design Review Standards and Guidelines (Chapter 17.06) is required as part of the review process for Planned Unit
Developments. Therefore, administrative Design Review approval is not required prior to issuance of a building permit for properties within a Planned Unit Development.
4. Historic Properties: Administrative Design Review with respect to building design is not required where the Historic Preservation Commission has the authority to issue or deny a
Certificate of Appropriateness (COA). In conducting its review for a COA, the Historic Preservation Commission shall apply any applicable Design Review standards of Chapter 17.06,
according to the corresponding zoning district in which the property is located, in addition to the applicable standards of Chapter 17.32, Historic Preservation. If the Historic
Preservation Commission determines that there is a conflict between the standards for Design Review and the standards for issuance of a COA, the provisions relating to issuance of a
COA shall govern. All other aspects of administrative Design Review, such as review of a Landscape Plan, shall be required.
C. Application and Approval
No separate application is required for an administrative Design Review. The Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager shall forward applications for Building Permits and Site
Development Permits requiring administrative Design Review to the Director of Community Development for review. The Director of Community Development shall grant Design Review
approval if the permit application complies with the Standards and Guidelines of Chapter 17.06, “Design Review Standards and Guidelines”. If the Director of Community Development
determines that it does not conform, he/she shall inform the applicant in writing as to which standards were not met, and may offer recommendations as to how to gain compliance.
For projects requiring administrative Design Review, permit applicants are encouraged to schedule a Pre-Application meeting or an informal consultation with the Director of Community
Development or his/her designee prior to filing a permit application.
D. Appeal of Administrative Decision
An Appeal may be taken from the decision of the Director of Community Development regarding Design Review, as provided in Section 17.04.300.

17.04.260 – Zoning interpretations
A. Purpose
The interpretation authority established by this Section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Title, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address
every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of the Title in light of the
general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. The interpretation authority established herein is not intended to add or change the essential content of
the Title, but is intended to only allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
B. Application
Any person having an interest in a property relating to a provision of this Title for which an interpretation is sought may file a request with the Director of Community Development. In
addition, the City Council, Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager, or other City official may request that the Director of Community Development render an interpretation.
Appeals of interpretations by the Director of Community Development shall be filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, and the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 6.)
C. Procedure
A written request for an interpretation shall be submitted to the Director of Community Development, which shall include a description of the specific situation and the section of this
Title for which an interpretation is sought. The Director of Community Development shall render the interpretation within 15 days of receipt of all information necessary to render a
decision.
17.04.300 – Appeals
A. Purpose
The Appeal process provides an opportunity for persons affected by administrative decisions by the Director of Community Development and the Building and Code Enforcement
Division Manager to appeal those decisions.
B. Application
An Appeal may be taken to the appropriate review body by any person aggrieved by a written decision, order or determination under this Title by the Director of Community
Development or the Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager, if initiated within forty-five (45) days of the action complained of. The applicant shall file a written application
with the Director of Community Development or the Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager. The Director of Community Development and the Building and Code
Enforcement Division Manager shall transmit to the review body copies of all documents in their possession relating to the administrative decision being appealed. The Appeal shall
be referred to one of the following review bodies, based on the type of decision being appealed:
Appeal of administrative Design Review Decisions (All Districts except CBD1 and CBD2): Plan Commission
Appeal of Design Review Decisions (CBD1 and CBD2 Districts only): Historic Preservation Commission
All other decisions under this Title: Board of Zoning Appeals
C. Procedure
1. The review body shall establish a time and place for hearing the Appeal and give written notice thereof to all necessary parties not less than 15 days prior to the hearing. The
hearing shall be scheduled at a reasonable time, but not later than the review body’s second regular meeting following receipt of the Appeal, unless otherwise agreed by the
applicant. Any party may appear in person, or by agent or attorney, at the hearing. The review body shall thereafter reach its decision not later than its next regularly scheduled
meeting, or within 45 days after the hearing, whichever is greater.
2. Filing of an Appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the decision appealed unless, in the reasonable opinion of the Director of Community Development or the Building
and Code Enforcement Division Manager, a stay would significantly impair protection of the public health, safety and welfare. In such case the proceedings shall not be stayed
other than by a court order.
3. The review body may affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, or may modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination and to that end, has all the powers of the officer from
whom the Appeal is taken. Its decision shall be based on the documents pertaining to the administrative decision transmitted by the Director of Community Development and
Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager, as well as any additional testimony presented at the hearing.

Title 17 - Zoning
11
17.04.310 – Variations
A. Purpose
The Variation process provides a method to grant relief from conformance with the strict letter of the provisions of this Title, where conformance would cause a particular hardship or
practical difficulty to a specific property and where the relief granted is consistent with the purposes and intent of this Title.
B. Hearing and Decision
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing in accordance with Section 17.04.150 (Public Hearing), at which evidence in support of the Variation must be presented by, or
on behalf of, the applicant, and any evidence presented by interested parties shall be heard. Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in accordance with Section 17.04.160.
The public hearing shall be held not more than 90 days after filing of an application, and a decision shall be made not more than 30 days after the conclusion of testimony at the public
hearing or the Board’s next regular meeting after the conclusion of testimony, whichever is later.
C. Approval Criteria
The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a Variation only when it makes written findings with respect to each requested Variation, based upon the evidence presented at the public
hearing, that strict compliance with the regulations and standards of this Title would create practical difficulties or particular hardships for the subject property, and the requested
Variation is consistent with the stated purposes and intent of this Title.
In making its determination of whether practical difficulties or particular hardships exist, the Board of Zoning Appeals must take into consideration the extent to which evidence has
been submitted substantiating the following:
1. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical difficulty or particular hardship to the property
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
2. The conditions upon which the petition for a Variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
3. The purpose of the Variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property;
4. The alleged practical difficulty or particular hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property;
5. The Variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
6. The granting of the Variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and
7. The proposed Variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the
danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
D. Authorized Variations
The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant Variations from the regulations of this Title only in the following instances and in no others:
1. To permit a yard, setback or landscape buffer of a lesser dimension than required by the applicable regulations.
2. To allow a fence in excess of the height limitations required by the applicable regulations.
3. To permit the use of a lot for a use prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width, but the area or width of the lot shall in no event be varied to an extent that reduces the
requirement to less than ninety percent (90%) of the required lot area or width.
4. To increase the permitted maximum building or lot coverage, but the maximum building or lot coverage shall in no event be varied to an extent that increases the maximum by
more than twenty percent (20%).
E. Conditions
The Board of Zoning Appeals may require such conditions and restrictions concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening and other matters in granting a
Variation, upon a finding that such conditions and restrictions are necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements, that would reasonably be
expected to occur if the Variation were granted without such conditions and restrictions. All such conditions and restrictions shall be expressly set forth in the written record of the
Board’s approval of the Variation. Failure to comply with such conditions and restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the Variation.
F. Limitations
1. A Variation shall automatically lapse twelve (12) months after the date it is granted, unless the construction (pursuant to a building permit) authorized by the Variation commences
within that twelve (12) month period. However, the Board of Zoning Appeals may extend this period, upon written request from the applicant showing good cause.
2. A Variation is granted to a specific property and authorizes the conduct of the Variation only on the property identified in the application and is not transferable to other properties.
3. The approval of a Variation authorizes the relief from strict conformance with specific provisions of this Title, but does not authorize the establishment or extension of any use,
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure prior to obtaining all other required approvals, including building permits and
occupancy permits.
G. Variation Less than Requested
When consistent with the notice of Public Hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a Variation less than, or different from, that requested when the record supports the
applicant’s right to some relief, but not to the entire relief requested.

17.04.320 – Zoning text and map amendments
A. Amendments Authorized
The regulations imposed and the zoning districts and overlay districts created by this Title may be amended from time to time by ordinance adopted by the City Council, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this Section.
B. Procedure
No application for a Zoning Text Amendment or Zoning Map Amendment shall be acted upon by the City Council until after a public hearing has been held and the findings of the
hearing body have been reported to the City Council. The Plan Commission shall hold the required public hearing and make findings and recommendations for all Zoning Text
Amendments and Map Amendments including changes to District and Overlay boundaries, except that in the case of Zoning Text Amendments to Chapter 17.32, Historic Preservation,
and changes to the boundaries of the Historic District Overlay, the Historic Preservation Commission shall hold the required public hearings and make findings and recommendations,
which shall also be in conformance with Chapter 17.32, Historic Preservation.
The Plan Commission or Historic Preservation Commission, as the case may be, shall provide the City Council a recommendation and any required findings of fact within 45 days
following the close of the public hearing on a proposed amendment. The failure of the Plan Commission or Historic Preservation Commission to provide a recommendation within such
45 day period, or within such further time as the applicant may, in writing, agree, shall be deemed a recommendation against the approval of the proposed amendment. However, when
the Plan Commission is sitting as a Zoning Commission to consider comprehensive Zoning Map Amendments and/or Text Amendments, pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-13-12, as amended,
its recommendation shall be made within 30 days of the close of the public hearing.
C. Recommendations – Text Amendments Heard by Plan Commission
In making its recommendation to grant or deny an application for a Zoning Text Amendment, the Plan Commission shall consider:
1. The consistency of the proposed amendment with the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
2. The consistency of the proposed amendment with the intent and general regulations of this Title.
3. Whether the proposed amendment corrects an error or omission, adds clarification to existing requirements, is more workable than the existing text, or reflects a change in policy.
4. The extent to which the proposed amendment would be in the public interest and would not serve solely the interest of the applicant.
5. The extent to which the proposed amendment creates nonconformities.
6. The implications of the proposed amendment on all similarly zoned property in the City.
D. Recommendations – Map Amendments Heard by Plan Commission
In making its recommendation to grant or deny an application for a Zoning Map Amendment, including changes to Zoning District and Overlay boundaries, the Plan Commission shall
consider:
1. The existing uses and zoning of nearby property.
2. The extent to which property values are diminished by the existing zoning restrictions.
3. The extent to which the reduction of the property’s value under the existing zoning restrictions promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.
4. The suitability of the property for the purposes for which it is presently zoned, i.e. the feasibility of developing the property for one or more of the uses permitted under the existing
zoning classification.
5. The length of time that the property has been vacant, as presently zoned, considered in the context of the land development in the area where the property is located.
6. The evidence, or lack of evidence, of the community’s need for the uses permitted under the proposed district.
7. The consistency of the proposed amendment with the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
8. Whether the proposed amendment corrects an error or omission in the Zoning Map.
9. The extent to which the proposed amendment creates nonconformities.
10. The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in question.
The Plan Commission shall record its findings regarding these matters in relation to the proposed amendment, and shall transmit those findings to the City Council with its
recommendation. The Plan Commission recommendation shall be based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented and the Commission shall not be required to find
each Finding of Fact in the affirmative to recommend approval of an application for Map Amendment.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 14.)
E. Recommendations – Amendments Heard by Historic Preservation Commission
In making its recommendations to grant or deny an application for an amendment to the Historic District Overlay or a Zoning Text Amendment to Chapter 17.32, Historic Preservation,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall consider the purposes, standards and requirements of Chapter 17.32.
F. Written Protest
In case of a written protest against a proposed Map Amendment, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by
the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage directly
opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, filed with the City Administrator, the amendment shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of City Council then
holding office.
(1981-Z-6 : § 1 (part))
Title 17 - Zoning
13
17.04.330 – Special uses and amendments to special uses
A. Purpose
Special Uses listed within the various zoning districts include those uses that may be acceptable if established in an appropriate manner and location within a zoning district, but may
not be acceptable if established in a different manner or location. Special Uses may include, but are not limited to, public and quasi-public uses affected with the public interest, and
uses that may have a unique, special or unusual impact upon the use or enjoyment of neighboring property.
B. Authority
Special Uses and Amendments to Special Uses shall be authorized or denied by the City Council in accordance with the statutes of Illinois and this Title. No application for a Special
Use or amendment to Special Use shall be acted upon by the City Council until after a public hearing has been held by the Plan Commission, after due notice has been made, as
provided herein and by the applicable statutes, and after the findings and recommendations of the Plan Commission have been reported to the City Council.
C. Procedure
1. Public Hearing
The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with Section 17.04.150, at which evidence in support of the proposed Special Use or Amendment to Special Use
must be presented by, or on behalf of, the petitioner, and any evidence presented by interested parties shall be heard.
2. Findings of Fact and Recommendations
On the basis of the evidence presented at the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall record its reasons for recommending approval or denial of the petition (findings of fact) in
accordance with the following standards:
a. Public Convenience: The Special Use will serve the public convenience at the proposed location;
b. Sufficient Infrastructure: That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been, or are being, provided;
c. Effect on Nearby Property: That the Special Use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
d. Effect on Development of Surrounding Property: That the establishment of the Special Use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
e. Effect on General Welfare: That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the Special Use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort or
general welfare.
f. Conformance with Codes: That the proposed Special Use conforms to all existing Federal, State and local legislation and regulation and meets or exceeds all applicable
provisions of this Title, except as may be varied pursuant to a Special Use for Planned Unit Development.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 15.)
No Special Use or amendment to Special Use shall be recommended by the Plan Commission unless it finds that the proposed Special Use or amendment to Special Use
will conform with each of these standards. The Plan Commission shall submit its written findings together with its recommendations to the City Council after the conclusion
of the Public Hearing, and also may recommend such conditions as it may deem necessary to ensure conformance with these standards.
3. Action by the City Council
a. The City Council shall not act upon a proposed Special Use or an amendment to a Special Use until it has received a written report and recommendation from the Plan
Commission on the proposed Special Use or the amendment to the Special Use. The City Council shall not approve a Special Use or amendment to Special Use unless it
finds that the proposed Special Use or amendment to Special Use will conform to each of the standards in the preceding Paragraph 2.
b. An application for a proposed Special Use or an amendment to a Special Use shall be acted upon finally by the City Council within ninety (90) days of the receipt by the
City Council of the recommendations from the Plan Commission unless it is mutually agreed upon by the City Council and the petitioner that more time is required.
D. Conditions
The City Council may require conditions that it reasonably deems necessary to protect the public interest and to meet the standards set forth in this Title. Conditions may pertain to the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the Special Use or amendment to a Special Use. When a Special Use or amendment to Special Use is granted
with conditions, the City Council may require the applicant to provide evidence and/or financial guarantees to ensurethat the conditions will be complied with. Failure to comply with the
conditions imposed shall constitute a violation of this Title.
(Ord. 1981-Z-6 § 1 (part).)
E. No Presumption of Approval
The listing of a use as a Special Use within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such Special Use will be approved. Rather, each proposed Special
Use shall be evaluated on an individual basis in relation to the standards of this Section and conformance with the other applicable provisions of this Title.
F. Limitations on Special Uses
1. A Special Use shall lapse twelve (12) months after the date it is granted, unless the Special Use or authorized construction for that Special Use (pursuant to a building permit) is
commenced within that twelve (12) month period. However, the City Council may extend this period, upon written request from the applicant showing good cause. The provisions
of this paragraph shall not apply to any Special Use for a Planned Unit Development.
2. Special Use approval is granted to a specific property and authorizes the conduct of the Special Use only on the property represented on the application and is not transferable to
other properties.
3. The approval of a Special Use authorizes the use on the property in the manner proposed, but does not in itself authorize the establishment of such use without first obtaining all
other required approvals, including building permits, sign permits and occupancy permits.
4. Any modification or intensification of a Special Use that alters the essential character or operation of the use in a way not approved at the time the Special Use was granted, as
evidenced by the ordinance granting the Special Use, other record or by the provisions of this Title, shall require new Special Use approval in accordance with this Section.
5. If a Special Use ceases operation for a continuous period of twenty-four (24) months, the Special Use shall be deemed abandoned and the Special Use approval shall lapse. The
Director of Community Development shall determine if a Special Use has ceased operation and shall notify in writing the record owner of the property. The notice shall be
provided twenty-four (24) months prior to the date upon which the Special Use will be deemed abandoned. However, prior to the end of the twenty-four (24) month period the
Director, at his/her discretion and for good cause, may extend, for up to twelve (12) months at a time, the period for abandonment.
If the Special Use is not reestablished within the aforementioned time period or extension thereof, the Special Use approval shall lapse, and a new Special Use approval shall be
required to establish the use in accordance with this Section. This provision shall also apply to any existing use deemed a lawful Special Use in accordance with Section
17.02.040. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any Special Use for a Planned Unit Development, which is subject to time limitations contained in Section
17.04.420.
(2008-Z-23 : § 16)
Title 17 - Zoning
14
17.04.400 – Planned Unit Developments – Purpose and requirements
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are intended to accommodate projects that incorporate a single use or mix of uses, which are planned and developed, or redeveloped, as a unit. PUD
review encompasses zoning regulations for development of private facilities as well as subdivision and other land development regulations for development of public facilities. Therefore, the
standards to be considered in reviewing PUD’s have a wider scope than for other types of applications in this Title. PUD’s should provide amenities not otherwise required, and the PUD
process should not be employed solely as a means of intensifying the use of the land. The proposed Planned Unit Development shall be under single ownership or unified control at the time
of filing an application for approval of a PUD, or the applicant shall provide written evidence of his/her ability to gain ownership or unified control of the property if the PUD is approved.
1. Purpose
The purposes of the PUD Process are:
1. To promote a creative approach to site improvements and building design that results in a distinctive, attractive development that has a strong sense of place, yet becomes an
integral part of the community.
2. To create places oriented to the pedestrian that promote physical activity and social interaction, including but not limited to walkable neighborhoods, usable open space and
recreational facilities for the enjoyment of all.
3. To encourage a harmonious mix of land uses and a variety of housing types and prices.
4. To preserve native vegetation, topographic and geological features, and environmentally sensitive areas.
5. To promote the economical development and efficient use of land, utilities, street improvements, drainage facilities, structures and other facilities.
6. To encourage redevelopment of sites containing obsolete or inappropriate buildings or uses.
7. To encourage a collaborative process among developers, neighboring property owners and residents, governmental bodies, and the community.
2. Conformance with Codes
Unless otherwise approved in accordance with this Chapter, development within a PUD shall conform to the requirements applicable to the underlying zoning district or districts in
which the PUD is located, and all Land Improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of Title 16, Subdivisions and Land Improvement, of the St.
Charles Municipal Code. PUD’s, however, may allow for relief from the minimum requirements applicable to the underlying zoning district and subdivision ordinance in situations
where the City Council finds that:
a) Conforming to the requirements would inhibit creative design that serves community goals, or
b) Conforming to the requirements would be impractical and the proposed PUD will provide benefits that outweigh those that would have been realized by conforming to the applicable
requirements.
Factors to be considered in this determination shall include, but are not limited to the following:
1. The PUD will provide community amenities beyond those required by ordinance, such as recreational facilities, public plazas, gardens, public art, pedestrian and transit facilities.
2. The PUD will preserve open space, natural beauty and critical environmental areas in excess of what is required by ordinance or other regulation.
3. The PUD will provide superior landscaping, buffering or screening.
4. The buildings within the PUD offer high quality architectural design.
5. The PUD provides for energy efficient building and site design.
6. The PUD provides for the use of innovative stormwater management techniques.
7. The PUD provides accessible dwelling units in numbers or with features beyond what is required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or other applicable codes.
8. The PUD provides affordable dwelling units in conformance with, or in excess of, City policies and ordinances.
9. The PUD preserves historic buildings, sites or neighborhoods.
(2013-Z-3 : § 2; 2016-Z-4 : §2; 2008-Z-32 : § 17)
17.04.410 – PUD review process
A. Pre-Application Meeting
Prior to the filing of any application for a PUD, the applicant shall attend a Pre-Application Meeting to present initial ideas for the development of the proposed PUD.
B. Neighborhood Meeting
Prior to the filing of any application for a PUD, the applicant is encouraged to host a Neighborhood Meeting.
C. Concept Plan Review
A Concept Plan Review for the proposed PUD is required prior to submittal of applications for a Special Use for a PUD and a Preliminary Plan for a PUD. In the case of an amendment
to an existing PUD, a Concept Plan Review shall be required prior to any PUD application that includes any one of the following:
1. Increase or decrease of the land area within an existing PUD of 10% or more.
2. Major Change to an approved PUD Preliminary Plan requiring a Concept Plan Review as specified in Section 17.04.430.A, Major Changes.
(Ord. 2009-Z-9 § 3.)
D. Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan Procedure
The Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan procedure provides for formal review and approval of the proposed PUD. Once the Special Use for a PUD and the PUD Preliminary Plan
are approved, the applicant is entitled to approval of PUD Final Plans and a PUD Final Plat if they fully conform with the approved PUD Preliminary Plan and the ordinance granting
the Special Use for the PUD, as well as all other applicable ordinances. Approval of the PUD Preliminary Plan shall not constitute authority to proceed with construction of any
improvements, but rather constitutes approval of the designs for buildings and site improvements as a basis for preparing the PUD Final Plans. Preliminary Plan approval shall not
obligate the City Council or any of its appointed officials, boards or commissions to approve later phases or plans which do not conform to the approved PUD Preliminary Plan, the
ordinance granting the Special Use for the PUD, and this Title.
1. Application for Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan
Applications for approval of a Special Use for a PUD and a PUD Preliminary Plan shall be filed simultaneously with the Director of Community Development. However, for
multiphase projects, the City Council may consider, at the request of the applicant, the filing of a Special Use application for a PUD with a PUD Preliminary Plan for the first
phase comprising not less than one third of the property, and a Sketch Plan with Site Data for the remainder of the property to be developed in a later phase or phases. All
applications shall include the information, plans and data as specified in Appendix A. Review of a preliminary plan of subdivision submitted as part of a PUD Preliminary Plan
application shall be in accordance with the provisions of Titles 16 and 18 of the St. Charles Municipal Code.
(Ord. 2006-Z-12 § 2; Ord. 1981-M-32 § 3; Ord. 1981-Z-6 § (part).)
2. Plan Commission Public Hearing on the Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan Request
The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the application for Special Use for a PUD. The application for PUD Preliminary Plan approval shall be presented in
support of the Special Use application, and revised PUD Preliminary Plans may also be presented at a meeting or meetings following the public hearing.
3. Recommendation and Approval of Special Use for PUD and PUD Preliminary Plan
Following the Plan Commission public hearing, the Plan Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council regarding approval or denial of the applications for
Special Use for PUD and PUD Preliminary Plan. The Plan Commission may recommend such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, design, layout,
height, density, construction, maintenance, aesthetics, operation and other elements of the Planned Unit Development as deemed necessary to secure compliance with the
standards specified in this Title. The Plan Commission may recommend exceptions and deviations from the requirements of this Title and of Title 16 of the St. Charles Municipal
Code requested by the applicant, to the extent that it finds such exceptions and deviations are supportive of the standards and purposes for PUD’s .
The Plan Commission shall not favorably recommend, and the City Council shall not approve, a Special Use for a PUD or an amendment to a Special Use for a PUD unless they
each make findings of fact based on the application and the evidence presented at the public hearing that the PUD is in the public interest, based on the following criteria:
i. The proposed PUD advances one or more of the purposes of the Planned Unit Development procedure stated Section 17.04.400.A.
ii. The proposed PUD and PUD Preliminary Plans conform to the requirements of the underlying zoning district or districts in which the PUD is located and to the applicable
Design Review Standards contained in Chapter 17.06, except where:
a. Conforming to the requirements would inhibit creative design that serves community goals, or
b. Conforming to the requirements would be impractical and the proposed PUD will provide benefits that outweigh those that would have been realized by conforming to
the applicable requirements.
Factors listed in Section 17.04.400.B shall be used to justify the relief from requirements.
iii. The proposed PUD conforms with the standards applicable to Special Uses (section 17.04.330.C.2).
iv. The proposed PUD will be beneficial to the physical development, diversity, tax base and economic well-being of the City.
v. The proposed PUD conforms to the purposes and intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
4. City Council Decision on Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan Request
The City Council, after receipt of the aforesaid findings and recommendations from the Plan Commission, shall approve or deny the Special Use and PUD Preliminary Plan or
Amendment applications with such requirements, conditions, exceptions and deviations as it may deem necessary to ensure that the proposed development satisfies the
standards of this Title applicable to Special Uses and Planned Unit Developments. The City Council may require such evidence and guarantees it deems necessary to ensure
that the conditions stipulated in connection with the approval of the Planned Unit Development are being, and will be, complied with.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 18.)
E. PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering Procedure
Title 17 - Zoning
15
The purpose of this stage of the PUD review process is to evaluate plans prepared for construction of the PUD for consistency with the approved PUD Preliminary Plans and other
applicable requirements. Where plans prepared for construction differ from the approved PUD Preliminary Plans, this stage provides an opportunity to reconcile the differences, or to
approve changes to the PUD Preliminary Plans, as provided in Section 17.04.430.
1. Review and Approval
a. PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering
PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering, and any accompanying documents, shall be submitted to the Director of Community Development, and shall include the
information, plans and data as specified in Appendix A (Submittal Items). The PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering may be submitted with the applications for Special
Use for a PUD and PUD Preliminary Plan, but this is discouraged for most projects because the plans may change during the PUD Preliminary Plan review process.
The PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering shall conform to the PUD Preliminary Plan with respect to all items specifically shown on the PUD Preliminary Plan, unless a
change is approved in conformance with Section 17.04.430, and further shall conform to all applicable requirements of the St. Charles Municipal Code.
In accordance with Title 16 of the St. Charles Municipal Code, Final Engineering Plans for PUD’s are not subject to the review and approval of the Plan Commission and
City Council, provided they conform to the approved PUD Preliminary Plan. The Director of Community Development is authorized to approve PUD Final Plans, and the
Director of Public Works is authorized to approve Final Engineering Plans, based upon their review for conformance with all applicable requirements.
b. PUD Final Plat
A PUD Final Plat may be submitted for the entire PUD or, if it is to have multiple phases, for a portion of the PUD. The PUD Final Plat or plats shall encompass the same
geographic area as the Final PUD Plans and Final Engineering Plans, with the exception of necessary off-site improvements and easements.
c. Plan Commission Recommendation on PUD Final Plat
The application for approval of a PUD Final Plat and supporting data shall be filed at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Plan Commission meeting. The Plan Commission
shall not be obligated to make a recommendation regarding the PUD Final Plat until it has received notice of approval of the PUD Final Plans and Final Engineering Plans
by the City staff. The Plan Commission shall review the PUD Final Plat for conformance with the approved PUD Preliminary Plan, and shall make its recommendations to
the City Council.
d. City Council Decision on PUD Final Plat
The City Council, after receipt of the aforesaid recommendations from the Plan Commission, shall approve or deny the PUD Final Plat.
2. Recording; Approval of Final Plans and Engineering Plans
The PUD Final Plat shall be filed with the County Recorder of Deeds and the applicant shall pay all recording costs. No PUD Final Plat shall be recorded until the PUD Final
Plans and Final Engineering have been approved by the Director of Community Development and the Director of Public Works, and the required Land Improvements have been
completed or the required collateral for the Land Improvements has been posted by the developer as provided in Title 16, Subdivisions and Land Improvements, of the St.
Charles Municipal Code. No permit for construction of a building or any other improvement shall be issued until the PUD Final Plat is recorded for the phase of the PUD in which
the building or other improvement is located.
F. PUD Preliminary Plan process for lots within an existing PUD
This abbreviated review process provides for formal review and approval of PUD Preliminary Plans for the development of lots that were previously platted pursuant to an ordinance
approving a Special Use for PUD. This process shall not apply if the proposed development constitutes a Major Change to an ordinance granting a Special Use for PUD as defined in
Section 17.04.430.
1. Pre-Application Meeting
A Pre-Application meeting prior to the filing of an application for PUD Preliminary Plan is optional but recommended to provide an opportunity to present initial ideas for the
development.
2. Concept Plan Review
A Concept Plan Review for the proposed PUD Preliminary Plan is optional but may be recommended if the proposed development differs significantly from the previously
approved Preliminary Plan or Sketch Plan for the site.
3. PUD Preliminary Plan Procedure
Application for approval of PUD Preliminary Plans shall be filed with the Director of Community Development. The application shall include the information, plans and data as
specified in Appendix A.
a. Plan Commission Review and Recommendation
The Plan Commission will review the application against the standards contained in the ordinance approving the Special Use for PUD and this Title. The Plan Commission
shall make a recommendation to the City Council regarding approval or denial of the application for PUD Preliminary Plan approval. The Plan Commission may
recommend such conditions and restrictions upon the design, layout, aesthetics, and other elements of the PUD Preliminary Plan as deemed necessary to secure
compliance with the standards contained in the ordinance approving the Special Use for PUD and this Title.
b. City Council Review and Recommendation
The City Council, after receipt of the recommendation from the Plan Commission, shall approve or deny the PUD Preliminary Plan application with such requirements or
conditions as it may deem necessary to ensure that the proposed development satisfies the standards of the Special Use for PUD and this Title.
4. PUD Final Plan Procedure
No separate application for PUD Final Plan approval is necessary. Following approval of the PUD Preliminary Plan, the applicant is authorized to apply for a building and/or site
development permit. The Director of Community Development shall issue PUD Final Plan approval based upon the plans submitted with the building or site development permit
if the plans fully conform to the approved PUD Preliminary Plan and the ordinance granting the Special Use for PUD, as well as all other applicable ordinances. Where plans
prepared for construction differ from the approved PUD Preliminary Plans, this stage provides an opportunity to reconcile the differences, or to approve changes to the PUD
Preliminary Plans, as provided in Section 17.04.430.
(2008-Z-32 : § 19)
17.04.420 – PUD timing and revocation
A. Recording of PUD Final Plat following Special Use for PUD approval
A PUD Final Plat for, at a minimum, the first phase of the development, shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s Office no later than two (2) years from the date of approval of the
Special Use for PUD. However, prior to the end of the two (2) year period the City Council, at its discretion and for good cause, may extend, for up to one (1) year at a time, the period
for recording of the PUD Final Plat.
If the PUD Final Plat is not recorded within the aforementioned time period or extension thereof, the approval of the PUD Preliminary Plan shall lapse, and resubmittal of an application
for PUD Preliminary Plan approval shall be required prior to approval of a PUD Final Plat. If a PUD Final Plat is approved and recorded for at least the first phase of the development,
the PUD Preliminary Plan as to the balance of the development shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years form the date of its initial approval.
If an approved PUD Final Plat for, at a minimum, the first phase of the development, is not recorded within three (3) years following the approval of the Special Use for the PUD, then
the approval of the Special Use for PUD, the PUD Preliminary Plan, and the PUD Final Plat shall lapse, and the property shall be subject to the requirements for the Zoning District or
Districts in which it is located.
B. Construction following PUD Final Plat recording or PUD Preliminary Plan approval
Construction for each phase of the PUD, as authorized by the issuance of a building permit, shall begin within two (2) years of the date of PUD Preliminary Plan approval for each lot
within the phase, or within two (2) years of the recording of the PUD Final Plat for that phase, whichever came later. However, prior to the end of the two (2) year period of the City
Council, at its discretion and for good cause, may extend, for up to one (1) year at a time, the period for construction. If the applicant fails to file for building permit within the
aforementioned time period or extension thereof, the approval of the PUD Preliminary Plan shall lapse, and resubmittal of an application for PUD Preliminary Plan approval shall be
required prior to construction.

17.04.430 – Changes in Planned Unit Developments
The Planned Unit Development shall be developed only in conformance with the ordinance granting a Special Use for a PUD and the PUD Preliminary Plans as approved by the City
Council. PUD Final Engineering Plans, PUD Final Plans, and PUD Final Plats contain additional detail to facilitate construction of the development. Recognizing that there may be a need
for changes during review or following approval of these final plans, changes to any approved PUD plans shall be handled as follows:
A. Major Changes
1. Changes which would require an amendment to the ordinance granting a Special Use for the PUD may only be approved after submittal of an application to amend the Special
Use for the PUD, together with applications to amend any previously approved plans.
2. Changes determined by the City Council to invalidate or contradict any of the Findings of Fact for Special Use for PUD or elements of the Preliminary Plans which were used as
a factor in establishing said Findings of Fact shall only be approved after submittal of an application to amend the Special Use for the PUD, together with applications to amend
any previously approved plans.
(Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 21.)
3. Changes to the approved PUD Preliminary Plan determined to be major by the City Council may be approved only by submission and reconsideration of a new PUD Preliminary
Plan, and, if necessary, an application to amend the Special Use ordinance. Depending on the scope of the Major Change, a new Concept Plan Review may be required prior to
submittal of the application for PUD Preliminary Plan. Factors listed in Table 17.04-2 shall be considered in determining whether a proposed change from the approved PUD
Preliminary Plan constitutes a Major Change, and whether a new Concept Plan Review will be required.
(Ord. 2009-Z-9 § 4; Ord. 2008-Z-32 § 22.)

B. Minor Changes
The City Council may, without review and recommendation of the Plan Commission, approve minor changes in the PUD plans that do not change the concept or intent of the PUD.
Minor changes are defined as any change not defined as a major change (see Paragraph A above) or an authorized administrative change (see Paragraph C below).
C. Authorized Administrative Changes
The Director of Community Development and the Director of Public Works may approve PUD Final Engineering and PUD Final Plans and changes or revisions to such plans which do
not alter the design or intent of the approved PUD Preliminary Plans, in order to accommodate field conditions and detailed design considerations that occur during PUD Final
Engineering or PUD Final Plan design. Administrative changes will typically involve minor relocations of features such as utility boxes, light poles, trees and landscape plantings,
drainage inlets, and walkways, or changes of two (2) feet or less in the locations of buildings, streets and parking lots; changes to the location, size, and design of wall signs; and
changes to the tenant/business identification area of free standings signs. Administrative changes must meet the applicable standards of the Zoning Ordinance or Special Use for a
Planned Unit Development Ordinance.

17.06.010 – How to use this chapter
A. Standards and Guidelines
The Standards and Guidelines of this Chapter shall apply to applications for Building Permits and Site Development Permits as provided in Section 17.04.230 (Design Review). The
Standards and Guidelines of this Chapter shall also apply to applications for Special Uses (Section 17.04.330) and Planned Unit Developments (Sections 17.04.400, et seq.).
The provisions of this Chapter include “Standards” and “Guidelines”, both of which must be addressed in order to obtain Design Review approval. “Standards” are specific
requirements that must be met. A Standard typically offers little flexibility unless options are provided within the Standard itself. A Standard may establish requirements not otherwise
contained in this Title, or may refer to other requirements more fully set forth elsewhere in this Title or the St. Charles Municipal Code. “Guidelines” are descriptions of design
characteristics intended to be applied with flexibility. Where a proposed design does not precisely follow the guideline, it may still be acceptable if the applicant can show how it meets
the intent for that group of standards and guidelines and the purpose and intent of this Title, in particular Section 17.04.230.
B. Applicability of Building Design and Material Standards to Existing Buildings
Existing buildings that do not comply with the building design or building materials standards of this Chapter shall comply with the following standards:
1. Building alterations or additions constructed primarily at the side or rear of a building may be constructed with the same design and materials as the remainder of the building,
provided an addition does not exceed 50% of the gross floor area of the existing building.
2. Any building additions to, or reconstruction of, street-facing building elevations shall comply with this Chapter to the extent practical to achieve a cohesive architectural design for
the building. The Director of Community Development may grant exceptions where an applicant can demonstrate that conformance would be incongruous with the architecture of
the building or would be impractical to construct (for example, re-facing a building façade with masonry material where no foundation exists to support the masonry).

(2006-Z-12 : § 2)
17.06.040 – Standards and Guidelines – CBD1 and CBD2 districts
A. Standards and Guidelines for Site Design
1. Building Placement and Lot Coverage
Intent: Establish site development patterns that are compatible with the historic patterns of downtown St. Charles, while allowing the flexibility necessary to produce more intense,
mixed use development that will foster a pedestrian-oriented environment.
Guidelines:
a. A building within the Downtown Overlay district should occupy at least 70%, and, whenever possible, 100%, of the width of its street frontage. Where buildings or parts of
buildings are placed more than five feet from the right-of-way line or property line, a pedestrian space between the building and the street should be created that is 16 to 20
feet deep, and should be occupied by an active use (outdoor eating and drinking or outdoor sales) or a public space (a small park or plaza).
b. The sides of buildings facing the river should be publicly accessible to the greatest extent possible, at the first floor level. This may result in more than one “front door” for
some businesses.
c. Buildings should be oriented towards zones of pedestrian activity, with primary entrances facing directly onto the street at street level.
d. To maintain historic patterns of building development in downtown St. Charles, building footprints should not occupy more than 75% of a block.
2. Parking and Service Areas
Intent: Provide adequate parking and service areas to serve development without overbuilding parking or overwhelming the pedestrian character desired for downtown.
Standards:
a. Surface parking lots shall not be located between buildings and the street, but may instead be located behind or beside buildings.
b. Private surface parking lots shall not be located directly adjacent to the river. Where parking must be located near the river, there shall be a landscaped area, preferably with
pedestrian amenities, between the parking lot and the river.
c. Service and loading facilities shall be oriented and/or screened so that they are not visible from public streets.
Guidelines:
a. Where a lot or use is eligible for the parking exemption (Section 17.24.080), on site parking is discouraged. Where parking is provided, its design and location should
Title 17 - Zoning
23
minimize impacts on the pedestrian environment. Perimeter landscaping or decorative walls for screening, parking courtyards, and use of brick or other decorative pavers
for surfaces, are examples of ways to accomplish this.
b. Vehicle access to parking structures, parking lots, and service areas should not be directly from arterial streets.
c. Where private parking is necessary, shared and joint-use parking should be pursued to minimize private surface parking.
d. Pedestrian zones along sidewalks should be protected with landscaping and street furniture within the sidewalk right of way, and should be supplemented with a row of
parallel or diagonal parking between the sidewalk and the traffic lanes.
B. Standards and Guidelines for Building Design
1. Building Design, Massing and Detail
Intent: New buildings should reflect the architectural heritage of downtown without copying historic architecture, and should be “of their own time.” Buildings also should be of
high quality and enduring value, so that in the future, they are as revered as the landmark buildings in the rest of downtown. While the design standards and guidelines do not
encourage the replication of historic structures, they do promote compatibility with the character of existing buildings in downtown.
Standard:
a. Plastic or backlit awnings shall not be used. While the use of more traditional awning materials and forms is encouraged, the width and height of awnings shall be related to
the window openings and design of the building.
Guidelines:
a. New buildings should not present a barren landscape of rooftop mechanical equipment and expanses of unadorned flat roofs when viewed from upper floors of existing
buildings. The patterns, materials and details of roofs and rooftops should foster views or become viewed elements in themselves, such as rooftop gardens. Rooftop
mechanical equipment should be organized and located or screened to be visually consistent with the patterns, materials and details of the structure.
b. In the Downtown Overlay district and other areas intended to have more intense pedestrian activity, buildings should be designed so that street level and second stories are
predominantly windows; street level facades, and facades facing the river or open space, should be a minimum of 50% transparent glass. Facades facing publicly
accessible walkways, but not facing streets should be a minimum of 25% transparent glass; upper floors should also contain transparent glass (30% or more); the use of
mirrored, tinted or opaque glass or spandrel panels in new buildings to fulfill this guideline is not acceptable. (Spandrel glass may have acceptable applications for other
purposes.)
c. For buildings greater than four stories or 50 feet in height, higher stories should be stepped back from street level facades a minimum of six feet and a maximum of sixteen
feet.
d. Design the lower levels of buildings with pedestrian scale, and a sense of human hand and craft rather than machine production; distinguish the street level of the building
from upper levels through the use of an intermediate cornice, a change in building materials or detailing, an awning, trellis or arcade, or lintels at upper level windows.
Building entrances should be designed as a prominent feature of the building.
e. Retail and entertainment uses should open directly onto a public street or publicly accessible pedestrian way (rather than through an interior lobby).
f. Use earth tones or muted colors in the materials used for building exteriors. The goal is to achieve a design where no single building stands out or overpowers the views or
the natural landscape of the valley. Lighter colors or bright colors should be used only in minor accents.
g. Employ building focal points or “landmark” elements (clock towers, turrets or other architectural devices) with discretion. The use of elements such as gratuitous clock
towers or fake dormers is discouraged.
h. The development of usable rooftop spaces is encouraged. The height of rooftop arbors or garden features should not be considered in the height of the building, but should
not exceed 12 feet in height. Such features should be set back from facades facing public rights-of-way at least 10 feet so they are less visible from ground level. Enclosed
structures on the roof, including those used for access, should not exceed 20% of the roof area, and “open” roof structures such as arbors or other structures to provide
partial shade should not exceed 30% of the roof area.
2. Materials
Intent: Use building materials in a meaningful way, but not in ways that result in a false representation of history.
Guidelines:
a. The use of brick and stone as dominant materials in a building is highly encouraged. In general, brick and stone should be the predominant materials for buildings within the
CBD-1 District, while more wood and other compatible materials are acceptable in the CBD-2 District.
b. Mortar should generally match the color of the brick or stone.
c. Accent materials used in parapets, lintels, cornices, sills, bases and decorative building elements should be brick, stone, cast stone or architectural precast concrete, wood
(except that wood shall not be used at parapets), untreated copper, terra cotta, or dark colored prefinished metal.
d. High quality pre-cast concrete and high quality metal (with a matte or non-lustre finish) and synthetic materials may also be acceptable on an individual basis, provided
such materials constitute less than 20 percent of the exterior and should be used in combination with other acceptable materials.
e. Reflective or mirrored glass is prohibited; only transparent glass should be used for street level windows.
3. Franchise Architecture
Intent: Preclude the development of new uses that employ franchise architecture, corporate colors or symbols other than signage to identify their presence. Avoid standardized
designs that do not fit in within the context of community character and neighboring development.
Guideline:
a. Franchise or corporate architecture should be avoided unless it is compatible with the Standards and Guidelines applicable to the downtown districts. Customized, site
specific designs should be provided for all development within downtown St Charles.
C. Standards and Guidelines for Public Spaces
1. Views and View Corridors
Intent: New development should be located or designed to maintain significant sight lines to the river and to prominent landmark buildings.
Guideline:
a. New buildings in the downtown area should not intrude into view corridors along First Street to the Hotel Baker, along street rights-of-way or extensions thereof toward the
Fox River, or from other streets and public spaces toward other prominent community landmarks.
2. Streetscape and Public Spaces
Intent: Where private development involves improvements to public property, establish continuity and identity through a quality streetscape design that results in a truly pedestrian
friendly environment and that creates a sense of place.
Standards:
a. Public sidewalks shall be designed to support pedestrian movement and allow for a variety of activities such as sitting, conversing, people watching, etc. via streetscape
enhancements; sidewalk widths along public streets shall generally be 12 feet or more in width.
b. Pole-mounted or building mounted lighting shall be designed at a pedestrian scale, and that is compatible with the historic character of the area.
c. Street crossings (or even intersections) shall be enhanced with pavement materials, colors or textures that highlight the crossing as a pedestrian zone.
Guidelines:
1. a. Create plazas, courtyards and other urban open spaces for buildings with a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet; surround public spaces with uses that activate
the space, such as street level retail facing onto the space, housing, or eating and drinking venues.
2. b. Avoid the creation of large, singular spaces; rather, create a series of smaller spaces that offer opportunities for a variety of activities and views.
3. c. Spaces between buildings should not become “leftover” spaces; rather the design of the space should invite pedestrians with thoughtful pedestrian features or
simply by the craft and detail of the buildings along the space.
4. d. Provide seating at the rate of one linear foot per linear foot of perimeter of the open space; provide “perches” that allow viewing of activity in the space; at least half
of the seating in the space should be “found” seating (steps, walls, planter edges). Movable seating is also highly desirable.
3. Pedestrian Movement
Intent: Foster pedestrian movement and activity by protecting pedestrian spaces from intrusions and providing elements that offer comfort for pedestrians.
Guidelines:
1. Primary pedestrian movement routes should be reinforced with wayfinding devices (special pavements, signs, graphics).
2. Utility functions (electrical transformers and switchgear, signal control boxes) should be placed underground, within buildings, or along cross streets to avoid conflicts with
pedestrian movement and views.
3. Provide “protection” for the pedestrian zone in the form of bollards, large planters, or trees where parking is not allowed along a street.
4. Provide overhead cover for pedestrians; use arcades, building projections or awnings to afford a minimal level of protection from the environment; cover extending over the
sidewalk (awnings) should be located between 9 feet and 12 feet above the walk, and should project over not more than one-third the width of the walk (but not less than 4
feet). Such overhead cover should be coordinated with the locations of street trees and street lights. Cover afforded by an arcade (a covered passageway along the street
side of a building) should maintain a series of building columns at the sidewalk edge, and should be a minimum of 5 feet deep but no deeper than 2/3 the height of the
arcade.
4. Landscape and Public Art
Intent: Enhance developed areas with landscaping, public art, and unique features that tell the stories and commemorate the heritage of St. Charles.
Standards:
a. Comply with the provisions of Chapter 17.26, Landscaping and Screening.
b. Refuse and recycling containers shall be located away from the streets and pedestrian areas and shall be screened from the street view in compliance with Section
Title 17 - Zoning
24
17.26.120 (Additional Screening Requirements).
Guidelines:
1. a. Develop landscape patterns that are shaped as spaces for people (pocket parks, courtyards and urban open spaces and gardens) as opposed to more suburban
landscape treatments such as berm plantings and vegetative buffers.
2. b. Use Public Art to tell stories about the heritage, people and events of the community, and the natural history of the region. Public art can be made purposeful, as
well. For example, sculpture may double as a seating surface, manhole covers might convey messages about nature, and wide sidewalks or street intersections might
become tableaus for art.
17.06.050 – Standards and Guidelines – RM1, RM2, and RM3 districts
A. Building Location and Design
Intent: Provide a healthy safe environment in attached single family and multiple family developments where residents can have privacy while having opportunities to relate to their
neighbors and the community.
Standards:
1. Where a front or rear wall of a row of townhouses or multiple-family buildings faces the front or rear wall of another row of another townhouse or multiple-family building, the minimum
separation shall be thirty (30) feet. Driveways and parking areas may be located within this minimum separation area. For townhouse developments with garage doors facing garage
doors along an interior drive, the minimum separation at the ground-floor may be reduced to twenty (24) feet, provided that the upper-story living spaces comply with the separation
requirement of thirty (30) feet.
2. There shall be a minimum separation of ten (10) feet between side walls among rows of townhouses or multiple-family residential buildings.
3. A private yard a minimum of two hundred (200) square feet in area shall be required for each townhouse dwelling unit. This private yard may be located adjacent to a front, rear or side
wall, provided that it is immediately adjacent to the townhouse unit it serves and directly accessible by way of a door or stair. All private yards shall be landscaped with turf,
groundcover, shrubs, trees or other landscape improvements, such as walkways and patios.
4. No more than five (5) townhouse dwelling units shall be attached to one another in a row.
B. Façade Articulation and Reduction of Mass and Scale
Intent: To reduce the apparent bulk of buildings and relate them to a human scale
Guidelines:
1. To avoid the appearance of blank walls facing the street, when the side walls of a townhouse or multiple-family development face a street, the walls facing the street should be
designed with elements typical of a front façade, including doors and/or windows.
2. Large, flat facades should be avoided by articulating the building mass to create substantial shadows and visual interest. Windows, dormers, projected entrances and overhangs are
encouraged on the street facing façade to add variety and maintain a pedestrian-scale.
3. Buildings should be designed to be viewed from multiple directions and, therefore, should be designed with consistent materials and treatment that wraps around all sides. There
should be a unifying architectural design for multiple-family and townhouse developments with more than one building, utilizing a common vocabulary of architectural forms, elements,
materials and colors. Variety between buildings within this unifying design is encouraged.
4. Windows and doors should have raised elements to create shadows and articulation. In addition, three-dimensional elements such as balconies and bay windows should be
incorporated to provide dimensional elements on a façade. Windows should be set back (“punched”) into the façade to provide façade depth and shadow, in a vertical orientation and a
consistent style. Windows, doors, and building edges should be trimmed out with appropriate materials in a width corresponding to the scale and style of the building.
Title 17 - Zoning
25
Facades should be designed with consistent materials and treatment that wraps around all sides of the building. Street facades should create substantial shadows and visual interest.
Balconies, “punched in” windows with detailed trim, projected entrances and overhangs are encouraged on the front façade.
Title 17 - Zoning
26
Side walls of townhouses or multi-family buildings should be designed with front façade elements, such as windows and doors, to avoid blank walls facing the street.
C. Roof Forms
Intent:
Standard:
1. HVAC equipment and similar appurtenances shall be located and/or screened so as not to be visible from public streets or adjoining property.
Guidelines:
1. To ensure that new developments are consistent and compatible with the surrounding neighborhood character, consistency in the roofline should be achieved by using similar roof
forms with varying height and proportion.
2. For larger buildings, roof forms should be articulated so that varied planes and massing within the overall roof form are provided.
3. Large, monotonous, simple pitched roofs, without breaks in the expanse of the roof, should be avoided. Dormers and gables can be used to break up large expanses of roof area. For
flat roofs, cornices and parapets should be used to add variety and break up the roofline. Rooflines should be modulated every seventy-five (75) feet through the use of varied roof
heights.
4. Pipe stacks and similar appurtenances that are required by code and cannot reasonably be hidden should be concealed as much as possible by location and coloring.
Title 17 - Zoning
27
For townhouse and multi-family developments, monotonous roofs should be avoided. Dormers and gables can create breaks in the roof expanse.
4. Parking Areas and Pedestrian Walkways
Intent: Provide safe access and adequate parking for residents and guests, while avoiding large expanses of paved areas and minimizing the visibility or parking facilities.
Guidelines:
1. Parking lots and garages for multi family developments should be located to the rear or side of the lot, in areas that are less visible from the street. Large parking areas should be
broken into smaller segments.
2. Curb cuts should be minimized on arterial and collector streets through shared access, rather than individual driveways for each unit.
3. A clearly identified network of pedestrian connections should be provided in and between parking lots, street sidewalks, open spaces and buildings.
4. Townhouses should be designed with garages to the rear of the units or, if located at the front of the units, designed so that garages do not form the most prominent visual element of
the façade.
Parking areas should be located to the rear of buildings to minimize their visibility from the street.
5. Building Materials
Intent: Buildings should be constructed of quality materials that reduce maintenance costs over the life of the building, relate to traditional building materials used historically in Kane
County, and reinforce the character of the community.
Standards: Permitted and prohibited building materials in the RM-1, RM-2 and RM-3 Districts are:
1. Approved Materials
Approved materials for exterior use in the construction of new multiple-family and townhouse developments in St. Charles are as follows:
a. Modular-sized clay brick

d. Tilt-up concrete panels
e. Exterior Insulated Finishing Systems (EIFS) comprised of polystyrene foam panels, regardless of base or finish coat or treatment, located less than ten feet (10’) above grade, or
over more than ten percent (10%) of any building wall
f. Plywood, composite plywood or masonite sidings (T-111)
g. Panel brick or thinset stone veneers
h. Plastic
i. Reflective glass
j. Pre-fabricated steel panels of the type used in farm, storage and industrial buildings
k. Vinyl or aluminum horizontal siding
3. Uniform Materials
Use of uniform exterior building materials shall be required on all facades. For example, if the front wall contains a mixture of brick and wood, the side and rear walls shall contain the
same materials in approximately the same proportions.
(2011-Z-1 : § 9)
17.06.060 – Standards and Guidelines - RT-1, RT-2, RT-3, RT-4 and CBD-2 Districts (one- and two-family dwellings only)
A. Site Layout and Context
Intent: To ensure building placement is consistent with the development pattern of the surrounding neighborhood.

new home may be similarly sited.
1. Site grading shall be consistent with that of adjacent properties. The slope and elevation of the property shall not be altered in such a manner that results in an artificial change of
grade.
2. The amount of front or exterior side yard covered by driveways shall be limited per Section 17.24.070.A.
Guidelines:
1. Setbacks (front, side, rear) should generally follow the averages for the block on which the new house is located. Front and exterior side yard setbacks may be reduced based
on averaging of existing principal building setbacks along the street frontage of a block – See Table 17.12-2 for setback requirements.
2. Building and site layout should be compatible with existing topography and vegetation. Preservation of existing trees, particularly older growth trees, is recommended.
3. The coverage of driveways and parking areas in the front and exterior side yards should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.
B. Garages
Intent: To reduce the appearance and prominence of garages.
Standards:
1. Garages shall meet the provisions of Section 17.22.020 Accessory Buildings and Structures, including but not limited to: requirement to provide access from a public alley; limitations
on garage door width; and requirements to set back street-facing attached garages from the remainder of the building.
2. Detached garages shall be consistent with the architectural style of the house. Window styles, exterior materials, and trim detailing shall have a similar appearance to the house (but
use of exact materials shall not be required).
Guidelines:
1. Detached or rear-loaded garages are recommended. A Building Coverage bonus shall be provided where a detached garage or an attached garage accesses via an alley is provided.
See Table 17.12.2.
1. Street-facing doors on attached garages should incorporate glass panel windows.
2. The use of individual bay doors (single stall) is preferred over double-wide doors, particularly for street-facing attached garages. Stepped back, separate garage doors should also be
considered to further soften the impact of a street-facing attached garage.
C. Massing and Proportion
Intent: To reduce the appearance of mass and to encourage new buildings to match the scale of the existing neighborhood.
Standards:
1. Buildings shall comply with the Bulk Requirements provided in Table 17.12-2 (including setbacks, building coverage, and building height).
Guidelines:
1. Scale, proportions, and height should be compatible with the general characteristics of homes in the surrounding neighborhood. For example, effort should be made to reduce the
appearance of height of a two-story house constructed among single-story houses.
2. Simple building forms and shapes are encouraged.
3. The following methods may be incorporated to reduce the apparent mass of a home:
a. Step back portions of the home. For example, set the second story back from the first story or add an unenclosed porch on the first story.
b. Use dormers to break up roof mass, if consistent with the architectural style of the home.
c. Incorporate horizontal design detailing to visually break up flat walls. Examples include wide skirt boards, mid-section trim between stories, frieze boards along roof eaves,
partial or complete gable returns, or a change in siding or masonry patterns or materials.
D. Roofs
Intent: To encourage roofs and rooflines that add character and interest to a home.
Guidelines:
1. Roof form, pitch, and scale should match the architectural style of the house.
2. Simple gabled and hipped roof forms are preferred. Mansard and flat roofs should be used only if appropriate for the architectural style of the house.
3. Eaves that extend a sufficient distance to create shadow lines are encouraged if appropriate for the architecture of the structure.
4. The roof of the garage and other accessory structures should mimic the roof of the house in both form and pitch.
Title 17 - Zoning
29
E. Architectural Materials
Intent: To promote use of architectural materials in a manner that complements traditional building styles.
Standards:
1. Primary siding materials shall be used consistently and at approximately the same proportion on each elevation of the building. For example, for a building with a masonry front
elevation, masonry shall be used in a similar proportion on all other sidings of the building. (Note this Standard does not apply to materials used for accent purposes.)
2. Exterior trim detailing shall be consistent on all elevations. For example, the same size window casing shall be used for all windows on each elevation.
Guidelines:
1. Siding materials used for accent purposes on the front elevation (for example, a masonry water table or siding type used within a gable) are encouraged, but not required, to be used on
the other elevations.
2. The use of exterior trim detailing is recommended, including window casing (a minimum of 4 inches), wide vertical corner boards, skirt boards, frieze boards, and midsection trim.
3. The limited use of decorative elements such as gable trusses, exposed rafters, arched doors and windows, quoins, pediments, etc. is encouraged, provided such elements do not
overwhelm or clutter the home’s appearance and are appropriate for the architectural style of the home.
4. Shutters should only be utilized where appropriate for the architectural style of the building. If shutters are used, they should exactly match the window size.
5. Chimneys should be masonry when located on a street-facing elevation.
F. Windows
Intent: Provide windows that are consistent with the architectural style of the house while being complimentary to the window types and fenestration found on traditional building styles.
Standards:
1. The same window types and style shall be used consistently on each elevation where feasible. Double hung and casement windows may be used interchangeably provided they are
of a similar proportion and incorporate similar detailing where possible (such as the same lite/muntin pattern).
Guidelines:
1. Windows should be incorporated on all elevations.
2. The distribution of windows on each individual elevation should be balanced. Large areas of blank wall should be avoided.
3. The style of windows should match the architectural style of the house.
4. The use of fixed and large, undivided pane windows is discouraged.
5. The use of window muntins (divides) should be consistent for all windows.
G. Doors and Entrances
Intent: To promote designs that contribute to the pedestrian character and orientation of the streetscape.
Guidelines:
1. The primary entrance should be located at the front of the house, facing the street.
2. The front entry should be the predominate feature on the front elevation. Multi-story entry features should be used only when architecturally appropriate.
3. The style of doors, particularly the front door, should complement the architectural style of the house.
4. Open, full-width front or wrap-around porches are recommended to emphasize the front entrance. Porches should be at least six (6) to eight (8) feet in depth and constructed in a
manner so as to be fully functional. Porch detailing should be consistent with the architecture of the house.
5. Unenclosed Porches are permitted to encroach up to eight (8) feet into the front, exterior side or rear yards. Unenclosed porches are not included in the calculation of Building
Coverage. For the definition of an Unenclosed Porch vs. Enclosed Porch and Building Coverage see Ch. 17.30. For information on permitted yard encroachments, see Section
17.22.030.
H. Additions and Exterior Alterations
Intent: To ensure additions and exterior alterations are complementary to the existing home and blend with the neighborhood.
Standards:
1. Additions and exterior alterations shall abide by the applicable Standards and Guidelines in Section 17.06.606 A-F.

17.08.030 – Nonconforming uses of land, buildings or structures
This Section regulates land, buildings and structures that, on the effective date of this Title, are used in whole or in part for purposes that are not allowed in the zoning district, overlay, or
Planned Unit Development in which they are located.
A. Expansion of Use
A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without limitation:
1. An expansion or extension of a nonconforming use or its accessory uses to any land area, building or structure, or part thereof, other than that occupied by the nonconforming use
on the effective date of this Title.
2. An expansion or extension of the nonconforming use or its accessory uses within a building or other structure, to any portion of the building or structure that was not occupied by
the nonconforming use on the effective date of this Title.
B. Relocation
A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the lot
or parcel to which it is relocated permits the nonconforming use.
C. Change of Use
A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than 1) a use permitted by right within the zoning district, overlay, or PUD in which it is located, or 2) a use allowed as a
Special Use, for which a Special Use applicable to the property has been granted. Thereafter, that part of the land, building or structure occupied by the permitted use or granted
Special Use shall not thereafter be changed back to a use that is not allowed within the zoning district or PUD in which it is located. Any change in use in violation of this Title shall be
deemed an abandonment of the previously existing lawful nonconforming use.
D. Abandonment
If that part of a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of 180 days or more, such nonconforming use
shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land, building or structure shall comply with all regulations of
the zoning district in which such land, building, or structure is located. The period of such discontinuance caused by government action, acts of God, or other acts without any
contributing fault by the user, such as the default or bankruptcy of a tenant, shall not be included in calculating the length of discontinuance for this Section.
E. Damage or Destruction
A building, structure or portion thereof, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use which is not allowed in the district in which it is located and which is destroyed
or damaged by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
total cost of reconstructing the entire building or structure, shall not be restored unless said building or structure and the use thereof shall conform to all regulations of the district in
which it is located. In the event that such damage or destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of reconstruction of the entire building or structure, repairs or construction for
restoration may be made only if such work is started within one year from the date of the partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion.

17.08.040 – Nonconforming buildings and structures
This Section regulates land, buildings and structures existing on the effective date of this Title that do not conform to the yard, height, lot coverage, or other dimensional or bulk provisions of
this Title. (See Section 17.08.060 for additional provisions relating to signs.)
A. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any
nonconforming building or structure. No repairs or reconstruction shall be made that would create any new nonconformity, or increase the degree of any previously existing nonconformities.
B. Structural Alterations
Structural alterations, other than additions and enlargements, may be performed on a nonconforming building or structure, only in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the building or structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting the public safety.
2. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity.
3. When the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconformity.
C. Additions and Enlargements
A building or structure, which is nonconforming with respect to its bulk, shall not be enlarged or added on to unless the addition does not create any new nonconformity or increase the
degree of any existing nonconformity, except as follows: Where a wall of an existing single-family or two-family building is nonconforming with respect to the minimum yard or setback
requirement, the nonconforming wall may be extended vertically and/ or horizontally by adding to the existing building, subject to the following:
1. The existing nonconforming wall exclusive of a foundation wall must remain intact.
2. The wall extension shall not be any closer to the lot line than the existing nonconforming wall.
3. The extended building wall shall not create any additional nonconformities on the site.
4. The maximum building coverage and building height shall not be exceeded.
This section shall not permit the construction of a dwelling on a nonconforming foundation.
D. Relocation
A nonconforming building or structure shall not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same zoning lot or parcel, or to any other zoning lot or parcel, unless the building
or structure shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is relocated.
E. Damage or Destruction
1. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control of the property owner or tenant to the extent of fifty percent (50%)
or more of its replacement value at that time, then the building or structure shall not be restored or rebuilt unless the building or structure, including foundation, thereafter conforms to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The replacement value of the building or structure shall be based on: 1) the sale of that building or structure within the previous
year or, if that is not applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last two (2) years or, if that is not available; 3) the amount for which the building, structure or property was insured prior to the
date of the damage or destruction or; 4) an alternative method determined acceptable by the City Council.
2. When a nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control of the property owner or tenant to the extent of less than fifty percent (50%) of
the replacement value at that time, it may be repaired or reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the degree of nonconformity existing prior to the
damage or destruction is not increased. A building permit shall be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair or reconstruction within one (1) year of the date of damage or
destruction, and the construction shall be completed within one (1) year of issuance of the building permit.
3. In the event that a building permit is not obtained within one (1) year, or that repairs are not completed within one (1) year of the issuance of the building permit, then the building or
structure shall not be restored unless it conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located.
4. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure or part thereof is removed, demolished or destroyed by means within the control of the property owner or tenant, the building or
structure or part thereof that was removed, demolished or destroyed, as restored or repaired, shall comply with all requirements of this Title.
(1960-16 : § V (D; 2016-Z-11 : § 2)
17.08.050 – Nonconforming lots of record
This Section regulates lots of record, existing on the effective date of this Title, which do not conform to the lot area or lot width requirements of the district in which they are located. No
nonconforming lot of record may be improved except in compliance with this Section.
1. Individual Lots of Record in Residential and Mixed Use Districts
In residential districts and the CBD-2 Mixed Use Business District, a single family dwelling may be constructed and maintained on a lot which is nonconforming as to minimum lot area
and/or minimum lot width, if the lot was of record on May 23, 1960, was in separate ownership on the effective date of this Title, and conforms to all other requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located.
In the CBD-2 and RT-4 Traditional Single and Two-Family Residential district, a two-family dwelling may be constructed and maintained on a lot which is nonconforming as to
minimum lot area and/or minimum lot width, if the lot was of record on May 23, 1960, was in separate ownership on the effective date of this Title, and conforms to all other
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, if the lot contained a two or more unit dwelling on the effective date of this Title.
2. Lots of Record Held in Common Ownership
If on the effective date of this Title there are two (2) or more lots of record with contiguous frontage in single ownership, and one (1) or more of the lots is nonconforming as to minimum
lot area and/or minimum lot width, the lots shall be considered to be a single undivided parcel for the purposes of this Title. No portion of said parcel shall be used or conveyed which
does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements established by this Title. No division of the parcel shall be made which leaves the remaining lot(s) with lot width or lot area below
the requirements of this Title. No building permit shall be issued for the use of any lot or portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this Section.
If the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a variation or variations to the required minimum lot area or width that renders the contiguous nonconforming lots buildable, then the provisions of this
section shall be considered satisfied and the lots of record may be conveyed and building permits may be issued, to the extent authorized by the variation.

written request must explain how the nonconformities will be resolved within the extension period.
E. No nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign except that the copy, message or graphic of a nonconforming sign may be changed by replacing nonstructural
components on which the copy, message or graphic is displayed, such as a plastic or metal panel or insert. No part of a nonconforming sing’s supporting structure, electrical, or lighting
equipment shall be replaced or modified so as to extend the life of the sign.

17.14.010 – Purpose statements
A. BL Local Business District
The purpose of the BL Local Business District is to provide locations for small-scale service and retail uses that primarily serve the convenience needs of St. Charles neighborhoods.
The BL District permits a mix of uses, but care must be taken to ensure that adequate access, parking and screening is provided so as not to negatively impact adjoining residential
neighborhoods.
B. BC Community Business District
The purpose of the BC Community Business District is to accommodate mid-size retail and service development along Strategic Regional Arterial corridors such as Route 64 and
Randall Road. Uses in the BC District have the potential to generate significant automobile traffic, and therefore care must be taken to properly design access and parking facilities.
Since this district is located along the roads that serve as gateways into St. Charles, quality building architecture, landscaping and other site improvements are necessary to ensure this
type of development enhances St. Charles’ image.
C. BR Regional Business District
The purpose of the BR Regional Business District is to provide locations along Strategic Regional Arterial corridors for shopping centers and business uses that draw patrons from St.
Charles, surrounding communities and the broader region. The BR District consists primarily of large-scale development that has the potential to generate significant automobile traffic.
It should be designed in a coordinated manner with an interconnected street network that is consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan. Uncoordinated, piecemeal development of
small parcels that do not fit into a larger context are discouraged in the BR District. Compatible land uses, access, traffic circulation, stormwater management and natural features, all
should be integrated into an overall development plan. Because this district is primarily at highvisibility locations, quality building architecture, landscaping and other site improvements
are required to ensure superior aesthetic and functional quality.
D. CBD-1 Central Business District
The purpose of the CBD-1 Central Business District is to provide for the maintenance and orderly growth of a mixed use, pedestrian friendly, compact district of retail, service, office,
and higher density residential uses in the central area of the City. Development within the CBD-1 District is intended to promote the upgrade and full utilization of existing older
structures as well as appropriate redevelopment.
E. CBD-2 Mixed Use Business District
The purpose of the CBD-2 Mixed Use District is to provide for a properly scaled mixed-use transition between single-family residential neighborhoods and the retail core of the CBD-1
Central Business District. The CBD-2 District permits a mix of retail, service, office, and medium-density residential uses within buildings that are of a reduced height and scale than
that permitted in theCBD-1 District. However, development in this district is also intended to retain a pedestrianoriented character, similar to that of the CBD-1 District.
F. Downtown Overlay District
The purpose of the Downtown Overlay District is to preserve the economic vitality and pedestrian character of downtown’s shopping core within the CBD-1 and CBD-2 Districts by
encouraging the continuous flow of pedestrian movement. This is accomplished by limiting uses on the first floor that typically generate relatively little pedestrian activity or are
otherwise incompatible with a pedestrian oriented shopping area. Only those uses listed in Table 17.14-1 shall be permitted on the street level or first floors of buildings/structures
within the Downtown Overlay District.
17.14.020 – Permitted and special uses - Downtown overlay exemptions
A. Table 17.14-1 lists permitted and special uses for the business districts, and for the first floor level of the Downtown Overlay District.
B. Buildings within the Downtown Overlay District are restricted with respect to the uses permitted on the first floor level, as provided in Table 17.14-1.
1. Exemptions. Notwithstanding these restrictions, the first floor level of a building within the Downtown Overlay District may be occupied for any use permitted within the underlying
zoning district (i.e., CBD-1 or CBD-2), upon certification by the Director of Community Development that its physical characteristics make it unsuitable for occupancy for any of the
first floor uses permitted within the Downtown Overlay District, and that altering such physical characteristics would either 1) be incompatible with the purpose of Chapter 17.32
(Historic Preservation) of this Title or 2) impose an undue financial burden on the property owner. Such physical characteristics may include but shall not be limited to:
inappropriate placement, size or orientation of doors or windows, a floor level which is not of a similar elevation to the adjoining sidewalk, lack of window area for display of
goods, lack of street frontage, and interior space which is not adaptable to the permitted uses because of structural components or limitations on accessibility. For purposes of this
section, an undue financial burden shall mean where the estimated cost of altering the building exceeds 25% of the current appraised value of the property.
2. Certification for Office Use. The first floor level of a building within the Downtown Overlay District may be occupied by certain office uses (Bank, Financial Institution, Office-
Business and Professional, and Medical/Dental Clinic) upon certification by the Director of Community Development that the proposed office use will meet the purpose of the
Downtown Overlay District, as identified in Section 17.14.010.F, to generate pedestrian activity and be compatible with a pedestrian oriented shopping area. To be eligible for the
certification, a property owner must demonstrate that the property has been vacant, not under lease, and publicly listed for lease for a minimum of 180 days by providing
documentation demonstrating the space was listed on a public listing service. The proposed office user shall demonstrate that the following criteria will be met:
a. The business will be open to the general public during normal business hours and may require that customers make an appointment for service.
b. The primary function of the business establishment will be to provide direct services to customers that are physically present.
c. The interior space of the business will be configured such that a) the street-level storefront entrance will serve as the public entrance and b) a reception area or waiting area
for visitors will be provided directly accessible from the public entrance.
d. Street-facing storefront windows and doors will not be obstructed at any time and shall be utilized to provide a view of the interior office visible to pedestrians on the street.
Illuminated exterior signs and the interior of the storefront shall be illuminated during evening hours.
A Certification for Office Use shall apply to the specific business only. A new Certification for Office Use shall be required for any new business to occupy a space. The
Certificationfor Office Use may be revoked if the Director of Community Development finds the business is not operating in accordance with the certification.
3. Appeal. If a property owner or business tenant has formally requested an Exemption or a Certification for an Office Use pursuant to subsections “a” or “b” above, and if the request
has been formally denied by the Director of Community Development, the property owner or business tenant may request an appeal of the decision before the City Council. The
City Council shall consider only the criteria listed above and may uphold or reverse the decision of the Director of Community Development.

A. O-R Office/Research District
The O-R Office/Research District is designed to accommodate office and certain service uses that require a percentage of lower building coverage and larger setbacks than those
types of office and service uses found within the commercial districts. The O-R District is designed to provide an open, landscaped appearance along public streets and to provide a
buffer area between residential uses and other commercial or industrial uses.
B. M-1 Special Manufacturing District
The purpose of the M-1 Special Manufacturing District is to accommodate older manufacturing areas in the City that are either in transition from manufacturing to alternative uses, or are
in need of rehabilitation. The M-1 District shall provide flexibility in design and parking requirements to allow for adaptive reuse and/or redevelopment for viable light assembly,
processing, heavy retail and service, and office uses.
C. M-2 Limited Manufacturing District
The purpose of the M-2 Limited Manufacturing District is to accommodate a wide range of manufacturing, assembly, processing, warehousing and office/research activities, both as
individual users and in a business park setting. New development and redevelopment in this District shall focus on providing sufficient setbacks, and adequate landscaping and
buffering from adjacent nonindustrial uses and public rights-of-way. Outdoor storage and loading, and other outdoor activities, shall be adequately screened.
D. PL Public Land District
The purpose of the PL Public Land District is to protect and maintain open space properties owned by the City, the Park District, the School District, and public and private recreation.

not require a permit, but shall otherwise be subject to the requirements of this Chapter.
The applicant shall submit a site plan or other suitable description to the Building Commissioner, with any required permit fee. As a condition of permit issuance, the Building Commissioner
may require conformance with specific conditions regarding the operation of the temporary use as may be reasonably necessary to achieve the requirements of this Chapter. If the Building
Commissioner finds that the applicable requirements have not been met, he may revoke the permit and may require the cessation of the temporary use. Where a permit for a temporary use
has been revoked, no application for a new permit shall be approved within six months following revocation.

the lot where the proposed temporary use is to be located, on the basis of the particular temporary use, the seasonal demand for parking on the lot at the time the temporary use is
proposed, and the availability of other public and private parking facilities in the area. The Building Commissioner may deny the permit for a temporary use if he finds that the temporary
use will result in inadequate parking being available for permanent uses on the same lot that are not connected with the business proposing the temporary use.
F. During the operation of the temporary use, the lot on which it is located shall be maintained in an orderly manner, shall be kept free of litter, debris, and other waste material, and all

17.22.040 – Site lighting
A. Applicability
The provisions of this Section are applicable to all exterior lighting in the City of St. Charles installed after the effective date of this Section, except for lighting installed and maintained
within a public right-of-way, lighting used in conjunction with public safety operations, and hazard or warning lights required by a governmental agency. No exterior lighting shall be
installed or modified so as to violate the provisions of this Section.
B. Light Source Visibility
1. For all property other than one and two family dwellings and townhomes, all exterior lighting shall be designed, shielded and directed so that direct light from the lamp (point light
source) is not directly visible from residential properties or public rights-of-way within a distance of 500 feet or less. This can be accomplished using luminaries which a) by their
design, direct the light downward; b) have opaque shielding installed that prevents direct illumination from reaching adjacent properties or public rights of way; or c) utilize a
translucent material to diffuse the light. This provision shall not apply to lighting for outdoor uses of a governmental entity such as a Park District or School District, provided all
other requirements of this section are met.
2. For one and two family dwellings and townhomes, all exterior lighting sources shall be either: a) limited to 900 lumens in the case of flood or spot luminaires and 1800 lumens for
all other luminaires, or b) designed, shielded and directed as required for uses other than one and two family dwellings and townhomes.
C. Light Intensity at Property Lines
All exterior lighting shall be designed and maintained at or below the following average footcandles, as measured horizontally at the property line, at a distance of 3.5 feet above grade:
Location Light Intensity
1. Property line abutting right-of-way: Horizontal foot candles: 0.5
1. Property line abutting RE, RS, RT and RM
Districts: Horizontal foot candles: 0.5
1. Property line abutting all other zoning districts: Horizontal foot candles: 2.0
1. Motor vehicle sales display lots only, property
line abutting right-of-way: Horizontal foot candles: 15.0
(Ord. 2008-Z-24 § 15.)
D. Glare
No exterior lighting shall be maintained on a lot so as to shine into, or upon, any other lot or any right of way with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer’s ability to see, or to
cause momentary blindness.
E. Interference with Traffic Safety
The following are specifically prohibited:
1. Exterior lighting used in a manner that could interfere with the safe movement of motor vehicles on public streets and alleys.
2. Any light that could be confused with, or construed as, a traffic control device, unless authorized by State, Federal, City or County government.
F. Uniformity
The uniformity ratio of exterior lighting on a lot, as defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), for all property other than one and two family dwellings
and townhomes, shall be 4:1.
G. Prohibited Sources
High pressure sodium and fluorescent lamps are prohibited because their color is significantly different from the daylight spectrum.
H. Uplighting and Architectural Lighting
Uplighting and architectural lighting is permitted to light a building façade, walkway, driveway, landscaping, sign or primary entrance, provided that all direct illumination from uplighting
shall be directed onto the building wall, walkway, driveway, landscaping, sign or entrance it is intended to illuminate, and the light intensity at the property line does not exceed the light
trespass standards specified in the preceding paragraph C. Illumination to highlight architectural features may include lines of low-intensity unshielded incandescent bulbs of a single
color, or neon tube type lighting, but only where such lighting is consistent with and will enhance the architectural character of the building and does not constitute part of a sign,
trademark, or other advertising display.
I. Building Mounted Luminaires
1. Luminaires mounted on buildings that are designed to illuminate parking lots, driveways, loading areas, and similar areas and that are not encompassed within the description of
“uplighting and architectural lighting” in the preceding paragraph, shall be a non-adjustable full cut-off design and shall be directed downward at an angle of no greater than 45
degrees from the vertical plane, and shall not project above the height of the building.
2. Luminaires exceeding 2000 lumens mounted on one and two family dwellings and townhomes shall be a non-adjustable full cut-off design and shall be directed downward at an
angle of no greater than 45 degrees, and shall not project above the height of the building.
J. Canopy Lighting
Luminaires mounted on gas station, drive-through and other outdoor canopies over vehicular use areas shall be a full cut-off design and shall be directed downward at an angle of no
greater than 45 degrees from the vertical plane, or shall be completely recessed into the canopy with flat lenses, or shall be shielded by other means, to block direct view of the light
sources as viewed from the property line at a height of three and one half feet (3 ½’) above grade.
K. Light Pole Height
The maximum height of light poles, as measured from finished grade at the base to the bottom of the luminaire, shall not exceed the maximum building height in the zoning district in
which they are located. Lighting for an Outdoor Recreation use owned and operated by a governmental entity such as a Park District or School District shall be exempt from this height
limitation, provided all other requirements of this section are met.
L. Signs
Sign illumination is governed by Chapter 17.28 (Signs).
M. Blinking Lights
Blinking, flashing, moving, revolving, flickering, changing intensity and changing color lights shall be prohibited, except for temporary holiday displays, lighting for public safety or traffic
control, or lighting required by the FAA or other governmental agency for air traffic control and warning purposes.
N. Exemptions for Historic Lighting Fixtures
Nonconforming historic lighting fixtures which are consistent with the character of a historic structure located within a Historic District or on a designated Landmark may be exempted
from the regulations of this Section 17.22.040, provided that the Historic Preservation Commission has made a finding that the fixtures are an important architectural or historic element,
the removal of which would be detrimental to the historic or architectural character of the building or site.
O. Exemptions for Private Street Lighting Lighting for private streets that is reviewed and approved as part of a Subdivision or PUD plan shall be exempt from the requirements of this
Section.

17.22.050 – Environmental performance standards
All uses shall comply with the performance standards established in this Section unless any Federal, State, County or local law, ordinance or regulation establishes a more restrictive
standard, in which case, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
(Ord. 1960-16 § IX (A) (5) (part).)
A. Noise
No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that generates a level of sound as measured on another lot greater than that allowed by Noise Regulations of the State Pollution
Control Board, as amended from time to time. The limits shall not apply to construction noises, noises emanating from safety signals or warning devices, noises not directly under the
control of the owner or occupant of the property, and transient noises from moving sources, such as motor vehicles, railroads and aircraft.
(Ord. 1960-16 § IX (A) (5) (a).)
B. Glare and Heat
Any activity or operation of any use producing glare or heat shall be conducted so that no glare or heat from the activity or operation shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which
the use is located. Flickering or intense sources of light shall be controlled or shielded so as not to cause a nuisance across lot lines.
(Ord. 1960-16 § IX (A) (5) (g).)
C. Vibration
No earthborne vibration from the operation of any use shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which the use is located.
(Ord. 1960-16 § IX (A) (5) (b).)
D. Dust and Air Pollution
Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from sources, such as storage areas, yards, roads, conveying equipment and the like, within lot boundaries, shall be kept to a
minimum by appropriate landscaping, screening, sheltering, paving, fencing, wetting, collecting or other acceptable means. No persons shall cause, or allow, the emission of fugitive
particulate matter across lot lines visible to an observer looking generally toward the zenith, beyond the property line. This requirement shall not apply when the wind speed is greater
than twenty-five (25) miles per hour. Determination of wind speed for the purposes of this rule shall be by a one (1) hour average or hourly-recorded value at the nearest official station
of the U.S. Weather Bureau or by wind speed instruments operated on the site.

17.24.150 – Design of off-street loading spaces
17.24.160 – Required off-street loading spaces
17.24.010 – Off-street parking and loading general provisions
The provisions of this Chapter shall apply as follows:
A. Existing Facilities
Existing off-street parking and loading facilities shall not be reduced below the
requirements of this Chapter with respect to the number of spaces provided or the design
of such facilities. If an existing facility provides less than the required number of
parking or loading spaces, no parking or loading spaces shall be removed. If an existing
facility provides less than the dimensions, landscaping, or other characteristics regulated
by this Chapter, no nonconforming dimension, landscaping or other characteristic
regulated by this Chapter shall be further decreased. Existing off-street parking and
loading facilities which do not conform to the requirements of this Title, but were
lawfully existing when the parking or loading facilities were established or substantially
modified, may be allowed to continue as legal nonconforming uses, subject to the
limitations of the provisions of Chapter 17.08, "Nonconformities". Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, if an existing parking lot is resurfaced or reconstructed, and the
parking lot does not meet the current yard requirement, the required yard may be
reduced by fifty percent (50%). If the existing parking lot is set back at a distance
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the required yard of the Zoning District, the existing
parking lot setback shall not be reduced further than the distance the existing parking lot
is set back from the property line.
B. Damage or Destruction
When a building is reconstructed or repaired after being damaged or destroyed, off-street parking and loading facilities shall be restored or maintained in an amount equivalent to that
which existedat the time of such damage or destruction. However, it shall not be necessary to restore or maintain parking and loading facilities in excess of the applicable requirements
of this Chapter.
C. Change in Use and Intensity of Use
When the intensity of use1 of a building, structure or lot is increased, or the use of a building, structure or lot is changed so as to increase the required number of parking or loading
spaces, additional parking or loading spaces, as the case may be, shall be provided. The number of additional spaces provided shall be the incremental difference between the
required number of parking or loading spaces for the new use(s) and the required number of parking or loading spaces for the previous use(s). In no event, however, shall spaces be
required in excess of the number required for the new use. (This condition would occur when the number of existing parking or loading spaces exceeded the number of parking or
loading spaces that were required for the previous use.)
When the intensity of use of any building, structure or parcel of land is decreased, the number of parking and loading spaces may be reduced, to the extent that the requirements of this
Chapter are met for the entire building, structure or parcel of land, as modified.
D. Provision of Additional Spaces
Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities, provided that all regulations governing the location, design and
control of such facilities shall be in accordance with this Chapter.
(2019-Z-1 : § 4; 1 Intensity of use is defined as square feet of gross floor area, number of dwelling units, number of employees, or other factors used as a basis for requiring parking or loading
facilities.; 1991-Z-7 : § 1; 1960-16 )
17.24.020 – Computation
The number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based upon the principal use as listed in Table 17.24-3. For principal uses having more than one functional area, such as a
manufacturing facility having associated offices, the number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based only upon the principal use. When more than one principal use occupies
a building or lot, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each principal use. Additional parking spaces shall be required for an accessory use only if
it is listed in Table 17.24-3.
In computing the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required by this Chapter, the following standards shall apply:
A. Space allocated to any off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street parking space or access aisle, or portion thereof. Conversely, the area
allocated to any offstreet parking space shall not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street loading space or access aisle or portion thereof.
B. For the purpose of determining the number of required off-street parking or loading spaces, Gross Floor Area (“GFA” in Table 17.24-3) shall be as defined in Chapter 17.32, Definitions.
C. A fraction of less than one-half (½) may be disregarded and a fraction of one-half (½) or more shall be counted as one (1) parking or loading space.
D. In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each twenty-four (24) inches of seating width shall be counted as one (1) seat
for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-street parking facilities.
E. Except as otherwise specified, parking or loading spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees normally present on the premises at
any one time. When the determination of the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees, the owner and/or managers, as well as contractors present on a regular
basis shall be counted as employee(s).

17.24.030 – Construction of parking and loading facilities
A. Permit Required A Building Permit is required prior to any construction, alteration or addition of any parking facility providing five (5) or more parking spaces, and for any loading
facility. For purposes of this Section, construction, alteration or addition shall include all paving of previously unpaved surfaces, placement or replacement of pavement, binder and/or
surface courses, construction of curbing, installation of new parking lot landscaping, and similar activities. Construction, alteration or addition shall not include maintenance activities
such as replacement of existing landscaping, repair of existing curbing, isolated pavement repairs, sealing, re-striping, or other maintenance activities.
(Ord. 2013-Z-21 § 4.)
B. Time of Completion The off-street parking and loading facilities required by this Chapter shall be completed prior to the issuance of the occupancy permit for the use they serve. If
weather conditions do not permit such completion, the Building Commissioner may issue a temporary occupancy permit for a maximum period of eight (8) months. The off-street
parking and loading facilities shall be completed prior to the expiration of the temporary occupancy permit.
(1991-Z-7 : § 1; 1960-16 )
17.24.040 – Collective provisions
Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided collectively on the same lot, if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required for each
separate use. No parking or loading space, or portion thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than one (1) use unless the Director of Community Development has approved
shared parking as provided in Section 17.24.050.
17.24.050 – Shared parking
The same off-street parking spaces may be shared between two (2) or more separate uses on the same lot, but only to the extent that the demand for such spaces by the separate uses will
not occur at the same hours during the same days of the week. No shared parking shall be approved unless the Director of Community Development makes a finding that the use of shared
parking spaces will not occur at the same hours during the same days of the week, based upon the type of uses and their hours of operation.
17.24.060 – Location of off-street parking
A. Location in Residential Districts
All required parking facilities accessory to uses in residential districts (RE, RS, RT and RM) shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served.
B. Location in Nonresidential Districts
Required parking facilities accessory to uses in the BL, BC, BR, OR, M1, M2, PL, and BT Overlay districts shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served, or on a
different lot in the same zoning district within 300 feet walking distance of the use served.
Required parking facilities accessory to uses in the CBD-1 and CBD-2 districts may be located on the same lot, or on a different lot in the CBD-1 or CBD-2 district within 500 feet
walking distance for nonresidential uses, and within 200 feet walking distance for residential uses.
C. Where required accessory parking facilities are provided on a separate lot, the owner of the lot containing the building or use shall demonstrate the right to maintain and use such
parking by providing the appropriate documentation to the Director of Community Development in accordance with the following:
1. Change in Use and/or Intensity of Use per Section 17.24.010 – a recorded permanent easement or other recorded instrument demonstrating the right to use the required number
of parking spaces on the lot containing the parking.
2. Construction of a new building or facility – a recorded permanent easement demonstrating the right to use the required number of parking spaces on the lot containing the
parking.
(2012-Z-5 : § 5; 2011-Z-1 : § 15)
17.24.070 – Design of off-street parking facilities
All off-street parking facilities shall comply with the following standards:
A. Setbacks and Yard Coverage
1. Single-family, two-family and townhouse dwellings
Off-street parking facilities and access drives may be located in any yard, but shall not cover more than the front or exterior side yard in which it is located than is specified below:
a. For circular driveways, up to fifty percent (50%) of the front yard, if both access points intersect with the front lot line, b) up to fifty percent (50%) of the exterior side yard, if
both access points intersect with the exterior side lot line or c) up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total area of the front and exterior side yards, if one access intersects the
front lot line and the other intersects the exterior side lot line.
b. For all other driveways, forty percent (40%), except that one driveway of at least 18 feet wide generally perpendicular to the street is permitted regardless of the percentage
of the yard it occupies.
(Ord. 2014-Z-14 § 1)
2. All uses other than single-family, two-family and townhouse dwellings
a. Off-street parking facilities shall not be located within the front or exterior side yard applicable to parking facilities as required in the district regulations; where no specific
yard requirement for parking facilities is specified in the district regulations, the requirement applicable to buildings in the district shall apply.
b. An access drive generally perpendicular to a public street may traverse any front or exterior side yard but shall not cover more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the front or
exterior side yard in which it is located, except that one driveway of at least 24 feet wide generally perpendicular to the street is permitted, regardless of the percentage of
the yard it occupies.
3. Other requirements for all uses
a. Off-street parking shall not be located in a Landscape Buffer (Section 17.26.070).
b. Buildings, parking decks, carports and other structures containing off-street parking shall comply with the front, rear and side yard setback requirements for such structures
applicable to the district in which the lot is located.

17.26.010 – Purpose
Landscaping contributes to the health, safety and welfare of the City by enhancing its character and scenic beauty, providing clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil, reducing
the rate of stormwater runoff, providing habitat for wildlife, conserving energy, and providing shade and windbreaks. Specifically, these regulations are intended to minimize the adverse
impact of noise, dust, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, visual pollution and other objectionable impacts on public and private property.
The use of native vegetation in managed landscapes, which is encouraged by this Chapter, may provide additional ecologic, economic, and aesthetic benefits. It provides wildlife habitat,
reduces emissions from lawn mowing, reduces the use of chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, provides enhanced erosion control and stormwater infiltration, and improves water
quality.
17.26.020 – Landscape plan improvements
A. Landscape Plan and Landscape Improvements Required
1. A landscape plan containing the information specified in Appendix A (Submittal Items) and depicting the landscape improvements required by this Chapter (“Landscape Plan”)
shall be prepared and approved in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The improvements depicted on the approved Landscape Plan shall be installed and
maintained in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
2. A Landscape Plan shall be required as part of Design Review (Section 17.04.230) and for PUD Preliminary Plans and PUD Final Plans. If a Landscape Plan submitted at the
time of building permit for a lot within a Planned Unit Development does not substantially conform to the approved Landscape Plans, it shall be submitted to the City Council as a
change to the PUD Preliminary Plan, and shall be reviewed as provided in Section 17.04.430
(Ord. 2011-Z-1 § 18.)
3. No Landscape Plan shall be required in connection with construction of or any improvements to a detached single family or two family dwelling or lot. A landscape plan shall be
required, however, for any common areas, including those within single-family subdivisions.
B. The Director of Community Development shall consult with a landscape architect registered in Illinois, or a horticultural expert, in the review and implementation of Landscape Plans.
C. For existing developments that lack the landscaping required by this Chapter, a Landscape Plan showing the required landscape improvements for all areas of the site to be disturbed
by the proposed construction shall be required when one or more of the following conditions applies:
1. When any new principal building is constructed on the site.
2. When any addition to a principal building is constructed that increases its gross floor area by twenty percent (20%) or more.
D. Resurfacing/Reconstruction of Existing Parking Facilities
1. When an existing parking facility or Drive-Through Facility is resurfaced or reconstructed such that: the amount of pavement to be resurfaced exceeds 50% of the parking facility,
the pavement is located within a required yard and/or within and/or within ten feet (10’) of the required yard, the resurfaced/reconstructed parking facility shall at a minimum
conform to the following:
a. The setback of the parking facility shall conform to the standards established in Section 17.24.010.A Existing Facilities.
b. The adjacent yard shall be landscaped in accordance with the standards established in Section 17.26.090. A Public Street Frontage Landscaping and Section 17.26.090.B
Screening of Parking Lots, Motor Vehicle Displays, and Drive-Through Facilities.
c. No existing landscaping shall be eliminated, unless it exceeds the minimum requirements of this chapter. ”
E. Field Adjustments to Landscape Plans
Minor changes in planting locations that do not reduce the quantity of plant material may be approved by the Director of Community Development without amending the approved
Landscape Plan. Reductions in the size of plant materials and changes to the species shown in the approved Landscape Plan shall not be permitted without submitting a revised
Landscape Plan for review as a major, minor, or administrative change in the case of a Planned Unit Development, or by the Director of Community Development in the case of other
property.
(2019-Z-1 : § 2; 2013-Z-21 : § 5)
Title 17 - Zoning
74
17.26.030 – General design principles and standards
The Landscape Plan shall address the following criteria:
A. Sensitivity to the Site
Landscape improvements shall be designed to integrate the building and other improvements with the site and its surroundings, with sensitivity to natural topography, watercourses,
and existing vegetation. Existing landscape material and topography shall be taken into account and preserved where feasible, particularly where mature trees are part of the site. (See
also St. Charles Municipal Code, Chapter 8.30 regarding tree preservation requirements.)
B. Scale and Arrangement of Landscaping Material
The scale and arrangement of landscaping materials and the size of planting beds shall be appropriate to the size of existing and proposed structures and site improvements. For
example, larger-scale buildings shall generally be complemented by plantings that are larger-scale at both the time of installation and at maturity. Whenever possible, plantings shall
be arranged in groupings and masses to provide a more natural appearance.
C. Existing Trees and Other Vegetation
Subject to the approval of the Director of Community Development, existing trees and other vegetation may be utilized in lieu of installing new plant material to satisfy the requirements
of this Chapter. The Landscape Plan shall accurately show the existing trees and other vegetation to be so utilized, and shall include the types and quantities of plantings that will be
installed if the existing plant material dies.
D. Storm Water Management
Natural drainage patterns and features such as swales, filter strips, wetlands and rain gardens shall be integrated into the landscape design, and shall be preserved or restored if
existing. To the greatest extent possible, stormwater detention and retention basins and associated landscaping shallbe designed to resemble natural landforms. Grading of
stormwater basins shall be designed so as to accommodate the proposed plantings. The Landscape Plan shall be coordinated with the stormwater management plan to slow storm
water runoff, increase infiltration on the site, and filter suspended solids and contaminants. Landscaping is required around the perimeter of all retention and detention basins, and a
planting scheme using native grasses and forbs to discourage waterfowl in developed areas is encouraged.
E. Softening of Walls and Fences
Plant material shall be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences and other barriers to create a softening effect and to help break up long expanses of blank
walls with little architectural detail. Conversely, where walls, fences, and other barriers are designed with articulation and/or architectural detail, there is less need for softening with
landscaping.
F. Irrigation
Landscape designs shall be cognizant of the need for water conservation and irrigation, depending on the site environment and type of plant material selected. Where no permanent
source of water for irrigation is available, the landscape design shall not rely on irrigation to maintain healthy plantings.
G. Energy Conservation
Plant material placement shall be designed to reduce the energy consumption needs of the development.
1. Locate sun tolerant trees and plants on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
2. Locate shade tolerant trees and plants on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
H. Berming
Earthen berms and existing topographic features shall be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient space and, in particular, where berms and existing
topographic features can be combined with plant material to provide effective screening. Berms shall be no steeper than a 4:1 proportion on average and shall have a rounded top
surface a minimum of five (5) feet in width to accommodate plantings. Berming more than one foot in height is prohibited over utility easements when located parallel to, or
approximately parallel to, the easement. Berming located perpendicular to utility easements is permitted.
I. Landscape Protection
Landscaping in proximity to vehicular areas shall be protected by curbs, wheel stops, decorative bollards, retaining walls, or other methods integrated into the site improvements or
Landscape Plan.
J. Clear Zones
1. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, landscaping around fire hydrants shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.44.070
M of the St. Charles Municipal Code, as amended.
2. A clear zone of three (3) feet shall be maintained in all directions from a pad-mounted electrical transformer; a ten (10) foot clear zone shall also be maintained in front of
transformer access doors to allow for operation and maintenance activities, in accordance with the guidelines established by the St. Charles Electric Utility. Plantings within this
zone shall be limited to non-woody plants or turf grass.
K. Parking Lot Landscape Islands
Landscape islands shall be a minimum of eight (8’) feet in width and a minimum of 160 square feet in area, their surface shall be at least six (6”) inches above the surface of the parking
lot and shall be crowned to allow for positive drainage, and shall be protected with concrete curbing, except in the case of a bioswale design. Bioswales, which are continuous,
planting beds designed for the conveyance, absorption, or filtration of stormwater runoff, may be provided as an alternative design to conventional planting islands.
(2019-Z-1 ; 2011-Z-1 : § 19)
17.26.040 – Selection and installation of plant materials
A. Selection of Plant Material
Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, size, and suitability to local conditions. The use of native woody and herbaceous plants is encouraged, unless a more
traditional approach would be more compatible with the predominant landscape design in the area, or with the architecture of the building. All plant materials shall be of good quality
and of a species capable of withstanding the climate extremes of northeastern Illinois and the conditions of the site. Size and density, both at the time of planting and at maturity, shall
be considered when selecting plant material. The use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred. Appendix C (Plant Palette) lists recommended and prohibited plant
materials. Plant materials other than those listed as recommended may be approved if consistent with the design standards and requirements of this Chapter.
B. Shade Trees
All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size at planting of two and one half to three inches (2 ½” to 3”) in caliper at planting, unless otherwise specified. Minimum caliper shall be
measured six inches above grade.
C. Evergreen Trees
Evergreens trees shall have a minimum height of six (6) feet at planting. Evergreens are useful in those areas where year-round screening and buffering is required. However,
evergreens are generally incompatible with prairie plants.
D. Ornamental Trees
Ornamental trees shall have a minimum height of six (6) feet at planting, with the exception of true dwarf species, which may be shorter.
E. Shrubs
Shrubs shall have a minimum height of twenty-four inches (24”) feet at planting.
F. Planting Beds
Unless otherwise specified, planting beds shall be mulched with shredded hardwood mulch. Mulch shall not be used as a substitute for plant materials.
(Ord. 2011-Z-1 § 20.)
G. Installation
All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the planting procedures established by the American Association of Nurserymen in effect at the time the Landscape
Plan is submitted. All plant materials shall be free of disease and shall be installed so that sufficient soil and water are available to sustain healthy growth.
Title 17 - Zoning
75
17.26.050 – Completion and maintenance
A. Completion Guarantee
All required landscaping and screening materials shown on the approved Landscape Plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit, weather permitting. In
periods of weather conditions adverse to planting the landscaping materials shown on the approved Landscape Plan, a temporary occupancy permit may be issued prior to installation
of landscaping and screening when the property owner provides the following:
1. A completion guarantee in the form of a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the estimated cost of the
landscaping installation, as certified by a landscape contractor or an Illinois registered landscape architect. (This completion guarantee shall not be required where the property
owner is a unit of federal, state, or local government.)
2. Written permission from the property owner giving the City and its agents the right to enter upon the property to complete the installation of required landscaping, in case of
forfeiture of the performance guarantee. (This provision shall not be required where the property owner is a unit of federal, state, or local government.)If the landscaping is not
completed within six (6) months after the issuance of the temporary occupancy permit, the cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit may be used by the City to complete the
installation of the required landscaping.
B. Maintenance
The owner of the premises, and any lessee, shall be jointly and severally responsible to maintain, repair and replace all landscape materials and other improvements shown on the
approved Landscape Plan over the entire life of the development. All trees and shrubs shall be maintained in good condition, including appropriate pruning. Planting beds shall be
maintained by seasonal mulching and weed control, and shall be kept free of refuse and debris. Any plant materials such as trees, shrubs, perennials and ground covers that die, are in
decline, or are supporting less than fifty percent (50%) of healthy leaf growth shall be replaced within six (6) months of notification by the City, in compliance with the approved
Landscape Plan; however, the Director of Community Development may approve alternative materials if he determines that they would be more suitable than the originally approved
plant materials and will provide an equivalent landscape effect. Plant materials that are diseased shall be treated, and if treatment is not successful, shall be replaced. Fences, refuse
disposal areas, barriers and retaining walls shall be maintained in good repair. Irrigation systems, if provided, shall be maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of
the plant material and the conservation of water. If existing vegetation that was used in lieu of new plantings to satisfy a requirement of this Chapter dies, the responsible party shall
install new plant materials in conformance with the provisions of this Chapter and the approved Landscape Plan. For natural landscaping the following replacement thresholds shall
apply. Plantings not meeting the minimum threshold shall be replaced after the time period specified.
1. Plantings of potted herbaceous perennials shall meet or exceed eighty-five percent (85%) survivorship of all plants and a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) survivorship of
any one species in healthy, vigorous condition, one full growing season following completion.
2. Plantings of seeded grasses, sedges and forbs shall meet or exceed seventy percent (70%) plant cover after one full growing season, eighty percent (80%) after two full growing
seasons, and ninety-five percent (95%) after four full growing seasons following completion.
17.26.060 – General landscaping requirement
The minimum percentage of a lot or parcel that is landscaped shall be:
1. 20% for a lot or parcel with on-site stormwater storage
2. 15% for a lot or parcel with off-site stormwater storage
3. No minimum for a lot or parcel in the CBD-1 Zoning District
If the total landscaped area resulting from the requirements of subsequent Sections of this Chapter is less than the percentage required by this Section, additional landscaped area shall be
provided to meet the minimum requirement of this Section.
Landscaping to meet this requirement may include any combination of the following:
1. Live plant materials such as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, ground cover, turf grass, and annual plantings;
2. Decorative surfaces such as pavers, flagstone, boulders, etc.;
3. Stormwater detention and retention basins, including planting areas and water surface, but not including retaining walls more than three feet (3’) in height;
4. Displays of public art, pedestrian plazas, walkways and seating areas open to the general public or to employees and patrons; and
5. Play surfaces such as ball fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts and other sport courts that are available for use by the general public.
Paving for vehicular access, concrete sidewalks, and curbing shall not be counted as landscaped area, except that systems designed to integrate a drivable surface with turf grass or other
plant growth may be counted as landscaped area, where they are provided for emergency access routes.
(2011-Z-1 : § 21)
17.26.070 – Landscape buffers
A. The Landscape Plan shall provide for Landscape Buffers to enhance privacy and provide screening between dissimilar uses, wherever the zoning district regulations require a
Landscape Buffer Yard. Where Landscape Buffers overlap with other landscape requirements with respect to the same physical area on the lot, the requirement that yields more
intensive landscaping shall apply, but the requirements need not be added together.
B. The Director of Community Development, in the case of Design Review, or the City Council, in the case of a Planned Unit Development, may reduce or waive the requirements of this
Section where existing conditions make it impractical to provide the required Landscape Buffer, or where providing the Landscape Buffer would serve no practical purpose. Examples
include, but are not limited to, instances where existing topography or structures effectively screen the more intensive use and provide a measure of privacy to the less intensive use.
C. Within required Landscape Buffers along common property lines, opaque, year-round screening shall be provided by means of berming, landscaping, fencing and/or decorative walls
to a height of six feet (6’) above the grade of the common property line.
D. Along right of way lines, where a Landscape Buffer of forty feet or more in width is required, opaque, year-round screening shall be provided by means of berming, landscaping, fencing
and/or decorative walls, to a minimum height of six feet (6’) above the grade of the right of way line. Such opaque, year-round screening shall be designed so that the first twenty feet
(20’) of the Landscape Buffer abutting the right of way line is relatively open and consists primarily of landscaping, and the elements of screening that provide opacity are located
twenty feet (20’) or more from the right of way line. Opaque, year-round screening is not required within Landscape Buffers of less than 40 feet in width along right of way lines.
E. For each 400 square feet of required Landscape Buffer, there shall be at least one shade tree or two evergreen trees, plus ornamental trees, shrubs, ornamental grasses, or perennials
as needed to soften the appearance of solid forms such as fences, walls and berms that may used to provide a visual screen.
F. If a new building or outdoor use is added on a lot where other buildings or uses exist, a Landscape Buffer, where required by the district regulations, shall be provided to buffer
adjoining lots from the new building or use, but an additional Landscape Buffer beyond that which is required for the new building or use need not be provided to buffer adjoining lots
from the existing buildings or uses.

Outdoor refuse dumpsters, recycling containers, compacting equipment, pallet storage, baled cardboard, and other refuse and recycling materials that are visible from public streets or
adjoining property shall be enclosed and screened on all sides by a masonry screen wall or opaque fence, at a height sufficient to provide screening of the container, unit, material and
pallets. Such enclosures shall be gated. No material shall be permitted to accumulate such that it is visible above the height of the enclosure.
B. Outdoor Storage
Where outdoor storage areas accessory to nonresidential uses are visible from a public street or from any lot in a residential district, opaque, year-round screening shall be provided by
means of berming, landscaping, fencing and/or masonry walls, to a minimum height of six feet (6’) above the grade of the right of way line or property line, as the case may be. Where
feasible, fences and walls used to provide the screening that are located along public rights-of-way shall be landscaped to provide a softening effect in accordance with Section
17.26.030 E (Softening of Walls and Fences). The height of materials stored outdoors shall not exceed the height of the screening provided.
C. Loading Docks
Except in the M-1 and M-2 Districts, loading docks shall be located and oriented so that they are not visible from the public right-of-way, or shall be screened from the public right of way
to a height of eight feet (8 ft.) above the elevation of the right of way line. If any lot in any district containing a loading dock adjoins or is across the street from a lot in a residential
district, the loading dock shall be screened from view from the residential property to a height of eight feet (8’) above the elevation of the common property line or right of way line, as
the case may be.
D. Screening of Mechanical Equipment
1. Ground-Mounted Equipment
a. In accordance with the provisions of Table 17.22-3 (Permitted Encroachments), where it is impractical to locate ground-mounted HVAC and other mechanical equipment
within the rear or interior side yard of a single-family or two-family dwelling, the Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager may approve an alternative location if the
mechanical equipment is screened with landscaping, hedges, berming, walls and/or fencing so as not to be visible from any public street or adjoining lot when viewed from
an observation height of five feet above grade.
b. For multi-family residential and non-residential buildings, ground-mounted mechanical equipment, such as HVAC units, refrigeration units, and pool equipment is
discouraged. Wherever possible, this equipment should be contained within the building or roof-mounted. Where the nature of the mechanical equipment or the design of
the building precludes its location within the building or on the roof, it shall be screened from view from public streets and adjoining residential dwellings by landscaping,
berming, walls and/or fencing. Color and texture of any screening wall or fence shall be compatible with the color and texture of the primary buildings on the site.
2. Building or Roof-Mounted Equipment
a. All newly installed or enlarged mechanical equipment, such as HVAC units, refrigeration units, and pool equipment located on the roof of any structure in any zoning district
shall be screened from view from public streets and adjoining residential dwellings by its location on the roof (away from the parapet), by an architectural element of the
building (e.g. a parapet), by a screening wall that is compatible with materials of the building, or a combination thereof. Where the majority of an individual unit of equipment
is screened by its location, a parapet wall, and/or the building architecture, and where installation of a screening wall would increase the visual mass of the equipment, a
screening wall may not be required, provided the unit is painted to blend with the building.
b. For existing buildings with roof-mounted equipment lacking screening, equipment may be replaced or added without additional screening, provided the equipment has
been located in the most unobtrusive location available on the roof. Where possible, new equipment shall be grouped with existing equipment in an organized manner that
is consistent with the architecture of the building.
(Ord. 2011-Z-1 § 25.)
E. Screening of Large Satellite Dish Antennas
Large Satellite Dish Antennas shall be fully screened so as not to be visible from any public street or adjoining lot when viewed from an observation height of five feet above grade.
Groundmounted antennas shall be screened by landscaping, berming, walls and/or fencing. Roof-mounted antennas shall be screened by their location on the roof (away from the
parapet), by an architectural element of the building (e.g. a parapet), by a screening wall, or a combination there of. Any screening wall or fence shall be compatible with the color
texture, and/or materials of the primary buildings on the site.

The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a framework for a comprehensive system of sign controls governing the display, design, construction, installation and maintenance of signs that
will:
A. Balance the rights of individuals to identify their businesses and convey their messages, and the rights of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs.
B. Protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
C. Reduce traffic hazards.
D. Enhance the attractiveness of the City.
E. Protect property values.
F. Promote economic development.
G. Further the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.

17.28.020 – General provisions
A. Violations
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, relocate, modify or alter any sign, or structure supporting a sign, in violation of the provisions of this Title. Signs which are not allowed by this
Chapter as permitted signs or exempt signs shall be prohibited. No sign shall be placed on a lot without prior consent of the property owner.
B. Placing Signs on Public Right of Way
No signs shall be erected on any public right of way other than those placed by agencies of government or signs whose placement has been authorized by the jurisdiction having
authority over the right of way. The City, without notice, may remove any sign placed on public right of way without authorization.
C. View Obstruction
All signs and attention getting devices shall comply with the sight triangle provisions of Section 17.22.010 F and the provisions of Section 12.04.200 of Title 12 of the St. Charles
Municipal Code regarding corner obstructions, except that yard and ground signs otherwise meeting the requirements of this Chapter may be located within the sight triangle.
D. Removal of Unused Structural Supports
No foundation, pole, frame, cabinet, or other structural support for a sign shall be erected or maintained independently of a sign allowed by this Chapter. All such structural supports
shall be removed at the time of removal of any sign or signs for which they provide support, except that a structural support may remain for a period of not more than 30 days following
the issuance of a permit to change the face of a sign, or erect a different sign, using the same structural support.
(2018-Z-10 : § 2)
17.28.030 – Sign area computation
1. Area of Signs in Cabinets, Frames, and on Panels
The area of a sign enclosed in a frame or cabinet or painted on or affixed to a panel shall be the area of the sign contained within the outer limits of the frame, cabinet or panel. The
area of such sign shall not include any external architectural framing elements or supporting structure such as a post, unless the architectural elements, or supporting structure is
designed as an integral part of the message or face of the sign. When there are multiple display signs within a frame, cabinet, or panel, the sign area shall be the area encompassed by
the entire frame, cabinet, or panel, and not the area of the individual display signs.
Title 17 - Zoning
79
2. Area of Signs Composed of Individual Letters or Elements
The area of a sign comprised of individual letters or other elements attached to a building wall or freestanding wall shall be the area of the smallest square or rectangle that can be
drawn around the letters and/or elements.
Title 17 - Zoning
80
3. Area of Double-Faced Signs
The sign area for a sign with two faces shall be a) when the sign faces are connected at an interior angle of sixty degrees (60?) or more, the sign area shall be computed by
measurement of both faces; when the sign faces are parallel or connected at an interior angle of sixty degrees (60?) or less, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of
one (1) of the faces.
4. Measurement of Sign Height Sign height shall be the vertical distance from the highest point of the sign to the grade of the adjoining street curb; if there is no adjoining curb, to the
grade of the edge of the adjoining street pavement.
5. Measurement of Sign Setback Required setbacks for freestanding signs shall be measured horizontally, from the closest point of the sign structure to the property line extended
vertically.
17.28.040 – Sign standards by type
A. Freestanding Signs
1. The primary support of a permanent freestanding sign shall be erected in such a manner that at least forty-two (42) inches of the length of the structural support is underground.
This requirement may be increased based upon the size of the sign and the height of the sign if necessary to provide for wind loads or other structural factors, as determined by
the Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner may require documentation from a structural engineer or manufacturer that indicates proper design and installation in
relation to the sign’s structural support.
2. Freestanding monument signs shall be mounted on a decorative masonry, metal or natural stone base. Alternative materials may be approved where they correspond with the
appearance of one or more materials used on the exterior of the building. The width of the base of any monument sign, as measured parallel to the sign face, shall be a minimum
of fifty percent (50%) of the width of the sign face.
B. Wall and Projecting Signs
1. Wall and projecting signs shall be safely and securely attached to the building wall. No sign affixed to a building shall project higher than the building height.
2. Except as permitted in the CBD-1 and CBD-2 Districts, signs shall not project into the public right-of-way.
3. Wall signs shall be affixed flat against the building wall and shall not project more than twelve (12) inches. No wall sign shall cover wholly or partially any wall opening or
architectural feature.

17.28.070 – Historic signs
A small number of existing signs in the City may be closely identified with a cultural or commercial entity or building that forms a part of the character or history of the community. Such signs,
however, may have been erected under a previous code and may not conform to all of the provisions of this Chapter. The intent of this Section is to permit such signs to be maintained.
Therefore, a sign erected at least forty (40) years prior to the year of application for Historic Sign designation that does not conform to one or more provisions of this Chapter may continue to
be maintained and shall not be subject to the amortization provisions of this Title, if the City Council determines, upon the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission, that all
of the following standards have been met:
A. The sign was lawfully erected at least forty (40) years prior to the year of application for Historic Sign designation and has been continuously maintained in the same location since that
year.
B. The sign:
1. Is attached to a significant historic building or landmark, and has come to be identified with that building or landmark, whether or not it is original to it; or
2. Is located on a site that has been continuously operated for the same business use for at least 40 years prior to the year of application for Historic Sign designation.
C. The sign is of a unique shape or type of design representative of its era, and that is not commonly found in contemporary signs.
D. The sign is associated with a family, business or organization that was noteworthy in the history of the St. Charles community.
E. The sign does not violate Section 17.28.080, Prohibited Signs.

17.32.080 – Certificates of appropriateness
A. Concept Review
1. Purpose
A concept plan may be submitted for the purpose of obtaining the Historic Preservation Commission’s comments and recommendations prior to the owner spending significant
time and expense in the preparation of detailed plans and architectural drawings and applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
2. Procedure
The property owner requesting a concept review shall submit a preliminary drawing of any exterior alterations or construction, current photographs of the property, a map or
survey showing locations of all structures on the property, and a list of proposed materials. The owner shall present the concept plan at a Historic Preservation Commission
meeting.
3. After discussion with the owner, the Historic Preservation Commission may make a preliminary determination whether the proposed work complies with the established criteria,
and may make recommendations as to any changes that would bring the proposal into compliance.
B. Certificate of Appropriateness: When Required
1. Except as provided herein, a Certificate of Appropriateness is required prior to issuance of a permit for construction, alteration, repair, demolition, relocation or other material
change that affects the exterior architectural appearance of any structure or site within an historic district or of any designated landmark building or site.
2. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition or relocation of a building or structure, a plan for the use of the property being vacated by the proposed
demolition or relocation shall be submitted and approved by the Commission, or upon appeal, by the City Council. The approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition
or relocation may be conditioned on issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness for the new construction on the site.
3. A Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued administratively upon the approval of the Director of Community Development in consultation with the Chairman or Vice-
Chairman of the Historic Preservation Commission for minor repairs, alterations or other changes that will have no impact on historic and architectural resources. From time to
time, the Historic Preservation Commission may recommend, and the City Council may approve, a description of such minor repairs, alterations or other changes for which a
Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued administratively.
4. The requirement for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be waived in emergency circumstances which require immediate relief, repair, or demolition, where the Fire Chief or
Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager certifies that such conditions exist and that said conditions can be eliminated as quickly as is needed only if the Certificate of
Appropriateness is waived. Emergencies are defined as life or health threatening conditions requiring immediate attention, as determined by the Fire Chief or Building and Code
Enforcement Division Manager. This subsection shall apply only in cases where it is impractical for the Historic Preservation Commission to review a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
(Ord. 2010-Z-4 § 5.)
5. Any above-grade attachment or other physical connection between a building located within an historic district or a landmark site, and any other building, structure, above-ground
improvement, open space or other portion of a property not located within the district or landmark site (excluding public and private utility wires, poles and related appurtenances),
shall be deemed an Alteration and/or an Addition to the building located within the historic district or landmark site that is subject to the Certificate of Appropriateness
requirements hereunder. Such attachments or connections include, but are not limited to, an addition to a building located in the district or landmark site that extends across the
district or landmark site boundaries or an outdoor deck and stairs from a building in the district or landmark site that extends across the district or landmark site boundaries. The
plans and specifications submitted for the Certificate of Appropriateness shall include the existing and proposed improvements to the property located outside the district or
landmark site boundaries to which the attachment or connection extends. In determining whether an attachment or physical connection to a building outside the district meets the
applicable criteria of this Chapter, the Historic Preservation Commission maytake into account the improvements existing on or proposed for such property outside the district or
landmark site.
(Ord. 2010-Z-4 § 3.)
C. Certificate of Appropriateness: Procedure
1. Where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required, the Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager shall furnish building permit applicants with an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
2. The Historic Preservation Commission shall review an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness within twenty-two (22) days following receipt of the application. Plans and
specifications for exterior work submitted with a permit application shall be made available to the Historic Preservation Commission. The Director of Community Development
shall notify the applicant of the time and place of the meeting. Failure of the Historic Preservation Commission to act upon an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
within twenty-two (22) days shall constitute approval and no other evidence shall be needed. Tabling the application shall be considered action by the Historic Preservation
Commission, provided, however, that any such delay shall not exceed twenty (22) days unless the applicant has not provided the additional documentation or expert technical
advice requested.
3. The Historic Preservation Commission may table the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness if it finds that additional documentation or expert technical advice from
outside its membership is needed to properly evaluate the application. The Commission shall hold an additional meeting or meetings to consider the application not more than
twenty-two (22) days from receipt of all requested documentation and technical advice.
4. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds, on a preliminary basis, that the work proposed in the application does not meet the applicable criteria of this Chapter, it may
recommend changes to the applicant that would cause the proposed work to meet the applicable criteria, and may confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve any differences
between the applicant’s plan and the applicable criteria.
Ord. 2010-Z-4 § 4.)
D. Historic Preservation Commission Findings and Recommendations
1. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the work proposed in the application meets the applicable criteria of this Chapter, it shall approve a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
2. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the work proposed in the application does not meet the applicable criteria and will therefore adversely affect or destroy
historically or architecturally significant features of a landmark or of a building, structure or site within a designated historic district, it shall recommend to the City Council denial of
the Certificate of Appropriateness. The Historic Preservation Commission’s recommendation for denial shall be in the form of a resolution stating its findings and reasoning. The
Director of Community Development shall forward the application for Certificate of Appropriateness and the Historic Preservation Commission’s Resolution to the City Council.
3. The applicant may submit an amended application to address the Historic Preservation Commission’s findings and recommendations. If the Historic Preservation Commission
finds that the amended application conforms with the applicable criteria, it shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness, and no action by the City Council shall be required.
E. City Council Resolution
1. The City Council may deny a Certificate of Appropriateness in accordance with the recommendations of the Historic Preservation Commission. Upon review of the Commission’s
resolution, its minutes and the application, if the City Council finds that the applicable criteria of this Chapter for granting a Certificate of Appropriateness will be met, it may
disregard the Historic Preservation Commission Commission’s recommendation and approve a Certificate of Appropriateness.
2. The applicant may submit an application for a certificate of economic hardship pursuant to Section 17.32.090, “Economic Hardship”. The City Council shall not deny a Certificate
of Appropriateness until a determination has been made concerning the certificate of economic hardship.
F. Invalidity. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be invalid if:
1. Changes have been made to the plans as approved by the Historic Preservation Commission or City Council
2. The permit issued for the work becomes invalid. A Certificate of Appropriateness remains in force for the same period of validity as the permit.
G. Certificate of Appropriateness: Criteria
In making a determination whether to approve or to recommend denial of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Commission shall be guided by
the following criteria:
1. Significance of a Site, Structure or Building
a. The Historic Preservation Commission shall apply the maximum flexibility allowed by this Chapter in its review of applications for new construction and for alteration,
removal or demolition of structures that have little architectural or historic significance. However, if the new construction, alteration, removal or demolition would seriously
impair or destroy historically or architecturally significant features of a landmark or of a building, structure or site within a designated historic district, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall give due consideration to protection of those historically and architecturally significant features.
b. The following properties are presumed to have architecturally or historically significant features:
i. Properties within a designated historic district that are classified as architecturally or historically significant by a survey conducted pursuant to Section17.32.070.
ii. Properties designated as landmarks pursuant to Section 17.32.300.
iii. All properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
c. The following properties will sometimes have architecturally or historically significant features - properties within a designated historic district that are classified as
architecturally or historically contributing by a survey conducted pursuant to Section 17.32.070.
d. The following properties will usually have little architectural or historic significance - properties within a designated historic district that are classified as architecturally or
historically non-contributing by an architectural survey conducted pursuant to Section 17.32.070.
2. General Architectural and Aesthetic Guidelines
a. Height
The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible with the style and character of the structure and with surrounding structures.
b. Proportions of the Front Facade
The relationship between the width of a building and the height of the front elevation should be compatible with surrounding structures.
c. Proportions of Windows and Doors
The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the building.
d. Relationship of Building Masses and Spaces
Title 17 - Zoning
105
The relationship of a structure to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
e. Roof Shapes
The design of the roof, fascia and cornice should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the building and with adjoining structures.
f. Scale
The scale of the structure after alteration, construction or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and character and with surrounding structures
g. Directional Expression
Facades in historic districts should blend with, and reflect, the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of adjacent structures. The directional expression of a building after
alteration, construction or partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style and character.
h. Architectural Details
Architectural details, including types of materials, colors and textures, should be treated so as to make a building compatible with its original architectural style and
character, and to enhance the inherent characteristics of surrounding structures.
i. New Structures
New structures in an historic district shall be compatible with, but need not be the same as, the architectural styles and general designs and layouts of the surrounding
structures.
3. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
a. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building, structure or site,
and its environment, or to use the property for its originally intended purpose.
b. The distinguishing original qualities or historic character of a building, structure or site, and its environment, shall be retained and preserved. The removal or alteration of
any historic materials or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.
c. All buildings, structures or sites shall be recognized as physical records of their own time, place and use. Alterations that have no historical basis, or which seek to create an
earlier appearance, shall be avoided.
d. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
e. Distinctive stylistic features, finishes and construction techniques or examples or skilled craftsmanship, which characterizes a building, structure or site, shall be preserved.
f. Deteriorated historical features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be based on accurate duplications
substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence, and not conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
g. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other physical or chemical treatments which will
damage the historic building materials shall not be used.
h. Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
i. New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize a property. Contemporary design for the new work shall
not be discouraged when such alterations and additions are differentiated from the old, and are compatible with the massing, size, scale, color, material and character of the
property and its environment.
j. New additions, and adjacent or related new construction, shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be unimpaired.
4. Design Guidelines
Advisory recommendations for applying the criteria of the above subsections “2. General Architectural and Aesthetic Guidelines” and “3. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation” to neighborhoods, Historic Districts, Landmarks, or to specific types of structures or sites. Design Guidelines shall be recommended by the Historic Preservation
Commission and adopted by the City Council.
(Ord. 2011-Z-3 § 3.)
5. Code Conflicts
Where there are irreconcilable differences between the requirements of the building code, life safety code, or other codes adopted by the City and the requirements of this
Chapter, conformance with those codes shall take precedence, and therefore the Historic Preservation Commission shall approve a Certificate of Appropriateness. In so doing,
however, the Historic Preservation Commission shall be obligated only to approve those portions of the proposed work that are necessary for compliance with the applicable
codes, as determined by the Building and Code Enforcement Division Manager or Fire Chief.
(2011-Z-3 : § 2; 2010-Z-4 : § 5)
17.32.090 – Economic hardship

12. Any other information reasonably necessary for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used by, or yield a reasonable return to, present or future owners.
C. After reviewing the application and any other information available, the Historic Preservation Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council regarding the application
for a certificate of economic hardship. If the City Council finds that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot obtain a reasonable economic return, it may issue a
certificate of economic hardship. In the alternative, it may delay the issuance of a certificate of economic hardship for a period of up to three (3) months. During this time, the City
Council shall inviteplans and recommendations from the Historic Preservation Commission, or any interested party, to provide for a reasonable beneficial use or a reasonable
economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include, but not be limited to, a relaxation of the provisions of this ordinance, an
abatement of real property taxes, financial assistance, the application of building code requirements, and/or changes in zoning regulations.
D. If by the end of this three (3) month period, the City Council determines that no viable alternative is available and the property cannot be put to a reasonably beneficial use, or the owner
cannot obtain a reasonable economic return, then it shall issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work.
E. The City Council shall consider the recommendations of the Historic Preservation Commission in deciding whether to issue the certificate of economic hardship, but may overturn the
Historic Preservation Commission’s recommendation if, in its sole discretion, it finds such action appropriate.

hereafter shall become effective immediately.
Amendments to the Kane County Stormwater Management Ordinance.
A. Article II, 9-28.D is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“Permit Fees – Schedule.
The following schedule of fees is established for the filing and review of all stormwater permit applications and the

Failure to respond within the 30 day period shall result in a default of permit obligation and allow the
Administrator to revoke the permit.”
B. Article IV, 9-83.C is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“Minor stormwater systems shall be sized to convey runoff from the tributary watershed under pre-development or
fully developed conditions as may create the greatest amount of runoff. The recurrence frequency for design
purposes shall be the 10-year event. The rainfall data shall be from ISWS Bulletin 70. Inlet capacity shall
generally be provided such that depth of ponding does not exceed 6 inches to facilitate the 10-year event. Pipe

elevation.”
C. Article IV, 9-83.L shall be appended to Article IV, 9-83 and shall read as follows:
“Fences."
1. Fences within drainage routes: Fences shall not be permitted:
a. where they impede the flow of storm water, or drainage; or,
b. below the high water elevation of a detention storage facility.
2. Fences within Easements – Affidavit and Release Certificate: Applications for fences installed in or across
an easement containing drainage rights shall have an affidavit and release attached, prepared by the
property owner, stating that he has read the requirements for fences located in easements and that he
agrees to comply with them and that he does for himself, his heirs, successors and assigns indemnify and
Title 18 - Stormwater Management Ordinance
2
hold harmless the City from any liability asserted by others in connection with the placement of the fence
and that they permit the removal of any fence or any other structure or form of landscaping within the
easement area by the City if the fence or landscaping impedes the flow of storm water or drainage. The
affidavit may be recorded at the owner’s expense by the City in the County Recorder of Deeds Office. In the
event the City shall determine it necessary to excavate or have access across the easement, the owner shall
remove the fence at the City’s direction and in the event of failure thereof, the City may remove the same at
owner’s expense and the City shall not be required to replace same.
3. Fences within Easements – Vertical Clearance: If the fence lies within an easement which contains
drainage rights, a minimum vertical clearance of four (4”) inches from the ground surface to the bottom of the
fence must be maintained. The vertical clearance shall be maintained for the entire length of that portion of
the fence that is installed in or across the Easement. Requests for a reduced vertical clearance requirement
may be submitted and will be considered in accordance with this section. Notwithstanding any guideline
given herein, the City Administrator may deny or approve a reduced vertical clearance which is in the
interest of public health and safety as he/she deems appropriate.
a. The vertical clearance may not be reduced in the following instances:
i. Fence around a storm water management basin or perpendicular to the emergency overflow
route of a storm water management basin.
ii. Fences that will impede the flow of storm water or drainage.
b. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

D. Article IV, 9-84.J.8 shall be appended to Article IV, 9-84.J and shall read as follows:
“Paved parking lots may not be utilized to provide any portion of the required site runoff storage volume.”
E. Article IV, 9-84.S shall be appended to Article IV, 9-84 and shall read as follows:
1. The site runoff storage requirements for the following projects shall be calculated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article IV, 9-84.S:
a. CMD Midwest Unit 1 (SSA #7) (Doc. 1915404).
b. CMD (SSA #5) (Ord. 1984-M-20).
c. CMD (SSA #4) (Ord. 1984-M-21).
2. Off-site regional stormwater detention has been provided for the three projects and SSA areas noted above.
The required off-site detention was calculated based on a “design percentage impervious surface”, with
said “design percentages” as follows:
a. CMD Midwest Unit 1 (SSA #7) (Doc. 1915404): 61.66%
b. CMD (SSA #5) (Ord. 1984-M-20): 56.67%
Title 18 - Stormwater Management Ordinance
3
c. CMD (SSA #4) (Ord. 1984-M-21): 56.67%
3. When development causes the percentage of impervious surface for any single lot to exceed the design
percentage noted above, site runoff storage shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth
in the 100-Year Detention Volume vs Percent Impervious nomograph provided as Figure T9-108.A of the
Kane County Technical Manual. The required volume shall be determined by establishing an initial volume
utilizing said Figure T9-108.A, based on the development proposal, and crediting the off-site regional
detention design percentage against that initial volume.
4. For illustrative purposes only: a site in SSA #7 with a proposed 65.3% imperviousness, which is greater
than the 61.66% imperviousness that the site was originally designed to accommodate in the regional
detention facility. Using said Figure T9-108.A (0.10 cfs/acre release rate), 65.3% hydraulically connected
imperviousness translates to 0.44 ac-ft./acre to be provided. However, using Figure T9-108.A (0.1 cfs/acre
release rate) at the “original design percentage impervious surface” of 61.66% imperviousness, 0.425
cfs/acre is to be “credited”. For a 2.5 acre site, 2.5 acres x 0.44 acre-ft./acre = 1.1 ac-ft. should be provided,
but 2.5 acres x 0.425 acre-ft./acre = 1.06 ac-ft. are credited. It is seen that (1.1 – 1.06), or 0.04 ac-ft. is to be
provided on-site for this example.
5. All other requirements of this chapter shall apply, including Requirements for Stormwater Mitigation / Best
Management Practices (BMPs) in accordance with Article V.
F. Article IV, 9-85.A.1 is deleted in its entirety and 9-85.A.2 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted
therefore:
“The engineer’s opinion of probable cost of otherwise providing the required Stormwater Management Measure
and the verifiable off-site Major, Minor or Subsurface Drainage System, including the value of the land required
and all construction costs. For this purpose, the land required shall be valued according to the use to which it will
ultimately be put if not used to provide the required Stormwater Management Measure. This cost shall be solely
determined by the Administrator. Challenges to land valuation and land area requirements are not considered in
this ordinance. The Administrator’s decision is final relative to this ordinance.”
G. Article VIII, 9-203.A.3 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“An irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the permitting authority, or such other adequate security as the
Administrator may approve, in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the approved estimated
probable cost to complete the construction of any required major and minor stormwater systems, stormwater
management measures (excluding category I BMPs) and special management areas.”
H. Article VIII, 9-203.C is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“The Administrator may approve periodic reductions in the amount of the security based upon the progress of
construction. At no time, however, shall more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the security be released prior to
approval of Record Drawings and final inspection. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the original amount of
the security shall be retained for a period of one year after completion of all required stormwater facilities.”
I. Article VIII, 9-204.A.2 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“An irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the permitting authority, or other adequate security upon approval by the
Administrator, in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the approved estimated probable cost
to install and maintain the required Erosion and Sedimentation Control Practices.”
J. Article VIII, 9-205.A.2 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“An irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Permitting Authority, or other adequate security upon approval by the
Administrator, in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the approved estimated probable cost
to install, monitor and maintain the native vegetated Category II BMPs or Watershed Benefit Measures.”
K. Article X, 9-258 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“Variances – Application Fee.
The following schedule of fees is established for the filing and review of all stormwater permit variances and the
activities related to said request:
1. Filing fee (payable when variance application is filed) fifty ($50.00) dollars:
Title 18 - Stormwater Management Ordinance
4
2. Reimbursement for professional services:
a. Recording fees;
b. Fees for attorney’s review and negotiations in connection with the filing, review and construction of the
application.
c. Fees for consultant’s review and consultation in connection with the filing review of the application
including meetings and associated tasks. Consultants may include but are not limited to Engineers
and Wetland specialists.
3. Reimbursement for City staff review: One and one-half times the hourly rate or pro rata salary of each City
staff member involved in reviews, meetings, inspections or any associated task relative to a variance
application.
The applicant shall pay all fees within 30 days of invoice by the City subsequent to performance of said tasks.
Any dispute of payment shall be sent in writing to the Administrator within 30 days of invoice by the City. Failure
to respond within the 30 day period shall result in a default of petitioner obligation and allow the Administrator to
cease consideration of the variance or revoke any permit granted including the subject variance.”
L. Article XI, 9-288.A.1 is deleted in its entirety and the following inserted therefore:
“Any person found guilty of an offense under this ordinance shall pay a civil fine in an amount not less than $50
and not more than $1,000. Each calendar day during which such violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the penalties provided in this Chapter, the City may recover reasonable attorney’s
fees, court costs, court reporter fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit against the person found
to have violated this chapter or the rules, regulations, permits or orders issued hereunder.”

2. Fractions. In the event that the calculation of the number of required Affordable Units results in a
fraction, the following rules shall apply: For that portion of the requirement that is to be satisfied by the
construction of Affordable Units, the fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number; a fraction
of exactly ½ shall not be counted as a required Affordable Unit. For that portion of the requirement that
is to be satisfied by payment of a fee in-lieu, any fraction shall be used in calculating the total fee in
lieu to be paid by the Developer.
3. Amount of Fee In-Lieu Per Unit. The amount of the per-unit fee in-lieu of Affordable Units shall be
determined annually by the City Council. If no fee has been determined by the City Council for the current

19.02.070 – Alternative Affordable Housing Plan
Title 19 - Inclusionary Housing
4
A. Alternative Affordable Housing Plan Criteria
As an alternative to compliance with the provisions of Section 19.02.060, the Developer may request the City
Council to approve, concurrent with the approval of the overall development and after receiving a
recommendation from the Housing Commission, one or more of the alternatives listed in this Section. The City
Council shall not approve an Alternative Affordable Housing Plan unless the Developer demonstrates and the
City Council finds in the affirmative that the Alternate Affordable Housing Plan is justified based on one or more of
the following criteria:
1. A demonstrated financial hardship exists that is not of the developer’s own making. Items to be
considered shall include but shall not be limited to:
a. The financial hardship must be equal to or greater than 10% of the total project cost and purchase
price, but cannot include any costs incurred as part of the normal and orderly development of the property.
b. Environmentally sensitive or natural areas to be protected are equal to or greater than 20% of the
total development site area (not including stormwater retention/detention facilities or park sites related to the
construction of the project).
2. The development site does not allow for the density bonus as stated in Section 19.02.080 due to
limitations on development capacity. Items to be considered shall include but shall not be limited to:
a. Insufficient water or sewer utility capacities.
b. Unique parcel configurations, which shall include but shall not be limited to steep slopes above an
8% grade or irregular shaped parcels that create unbuildable areas equal to or greater than 20% of the
development site.
3. The development will fulfill an alternative City Policy or goal such as redevelopment of a vacant,
underutilized, or blighted parcel that cannot otherwise be readily redeveloped and comply with all other applicable
requirements.
4. The creation of the Alternative Affordable Housing Plan represents an equal or greater opportunity to
