EL MONTE - MUNICIPAL CODE 2000 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of El Monte, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
> 
PREFACE 
The El Monte, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 2000, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Rachel Montes, Mayor, and Lorene Gutierrez, City Clerk. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2941, passed January 8, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 18, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Sections:

When any person is arrested in the city for violating any provision or failing to comply with any of the requirements of this code, and such person is not immediately taken before a magistrate as provided in the Penal Code of the state, the arresting officer shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court, which notice shall contain the name and address of such person to whom the notice is issued, the offense charged against him or her, and the time and place where and when such person shall appear in court. 
(Prior code § 1208)  
1.16.020 - Contents of a notice to appearGeneral. 
A.  Each notice to appear issued by a peace officer of the city as provided in Section 1.16.010 or other applicable ordinance of the city shall contain such information as required by law and shall be in a form as approved by the Chief of Police and the City Attorney. The Chief of Police is authorized to make changes from time-to-time in the form of the notice to appear as may be required by changes in state law or by changes in the El Monte Municipal Code. 
B.  The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person and the arrested person in order to secure release must give his or her written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
C.  The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein. Thereupon the magistrate shall fix the amount of bail which in his or her judgment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1275 of the Penal Code, will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant and shall indorse upon the notice a statement signed by him or her in the form set forth in Section 815a of the Penal Code. The defendant may, prior to the date upon which he or she promised to appear in court, deposit with the Magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the Magistrate, if the defendant shall not appear, either in person or by counsel, the Magistrate may declare the bail forfeited, and may in his or her discretion order that no further proceedings shall be had in such case. 
Upon the making of such order that no further proceedings be had, all sums deposited as bail shall forthwith be paid into the county treasury for distribution pursuant to Section 1463 of the Penal Code. 
D.  No warrant shall issue on such charge for the arrest of a person who has given such written promise to appear in court, unless and until he or she has violated such promise or has failed to deposit bail, to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment, or to comply with the terms and provisions of the judgment, as required by law. 
E.  Any person wilfully violating his or her written promise to appear in court is guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he or she was originally arrested. 
F.  When a person signs a written promise to appear at the time and place specified in the written promise to appear and has not posted bail as provided in Section 853.6 of the Penal Code, the Magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his or her arrest within twenty (20) days after his or her failure to appear as promised, or if such person promises to appear before an officer authorized to accept bail other than a Magistrate and fails to do so on or before the date which he or she promised to appear, then, within twenty (20) days after the delivery of such written promise to appear by the officer to a magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense. 
G.

Chapter 1.18 - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2865, § 2, adopted Sept. 15, 2015, repealed Ch. 1.18 and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 1.18, §§ 1.18.0101.18.130, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 2542, § 1(part), adopted in 2001; Ord. 2258, §§ 1, 5, 7, 8, adopted in 2002; and Ord. 2581, §§ 1, 2, 4, 5, adopted in 2003. 
 
1.18.010 - Findings and applicability. 
The city council of the city of El Monte finds and declares as follows: 
A.  Enforcement of the El Monte Municipal Code and adopted ordinances throughout the city is an important public service. A program for enforcement of local codes is vital to protect public health, safety, and welfare. The establishment of a comprehensive and effective code enforcement program that is able to utilize both administrative and judicial remedies against violations of the city's laws is best equipped to protect public health, safety, and welfare. 
B.  Government Code Section 53069.4 authorizes local jurisdictions to enact legislation making a violation of any local ordinance subject to an administrative fine or penalty. The state Legislature has also enacted other provisions of California law that allow local governments to impose administrative fines and/or penalties for violations of specified provisions of state law. The city council intends, pursuant to this statute, to establish an administrative citation program that: 
1.  Imposes a nonjudicial administrative fine and/or penalty for offenses of the El Monte Municipal Code (including, but not limited to, any other code adopted therein) and other state laws as authorized by statute; 
2.  Encourages prompt abatement or correction of prohibited conditions, uses or activities in the city; and 
3.  Creates deterrence against future violations of the city's laws. 
C.  The administrative citation remedy is not intended to replace any other remedy allowed by the El Monte Municipal Code or state law. It is intended to provide an alternative and/or additional means by which the city's laws may be enforced. 
D.  Use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city and is one remedy that the city has to address violations of the El Monte Municipal Code or other applicable provisions of state law. By adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its discretion or ability to utilize any administrative, civil, criminal, or other remedy available at law or equity, or any combination thereof, to address violations of the city's laws. 
E.  This chapter makes a violation of any provision, restriction, or requirement of this code or any code adopted by reference herein, any ordinance of the city, any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, or any condition of any permit, license, or other entitlement issued pursuant to this code subject to an administrative fine. 
F.  This chapter establishes the administrative procedures for the imposition, enforcement, collection, and administrative review of administrative fines and/or penalties pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.4. 
G.  An administrative fine in an amount adopted by resolution of the city council shall be imposed by means of an administrative citation issued by an enforcement officer, and shall be paid directly to the city of El Monte. Payment of a fine shall not excuse a failure to correct a violation, nor shall it bar concurrent or further enforcement actions by the city. 
H.  The city manager, or a designee thereof, may dismiss a citation at any time if a determination is made that it was issued in error, in which event any deposit of a fine shall be refunded. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015)

In the absence of an immediate danger, a citation for a violation pertaining to building, plumbing, electrical, or other similar structural or zoning issues shall not be issued pursuant to this chapter unless the responsible person has first been provided with a reasonable period of up to thirty (30) days, as determined by the officer, in which to complete the abatement or compliance actions. 
C.  An officer may issue a citation for a violation not committed in the officer's presence if the officer has determined, through investigation, that the citee did commit, or is otherwise responsible for, the violation. 
D.  Each day, or any portion thereof, that a prohibited condition, use or activity under the code is committed, continued or permitted shall constitute a separate violation for which an administrative fine may be imposed.

1.18.035 - Service of citation. 
A.  A citation may be served either by personal delivery to the citee or by first class mail through the United States Postal Service. The date of personal service shall constitute the issuance date of a citation.

D.  In addition to any fine imposed pursuant to this chapter, a reinspection fee and/or any associated costs expended (including, but not limited to, investigation, abatement, and legal) may be assessed against any responsible person in an amount established by resolution of the City Council if the responsible person does not timely and completely correct or abate a violation (with all requisite approvals, permits, entitlements, licenses, and/or inspections) after having received notification from the city to correct or abate same.

C.  Failure to pay an administrative fine within thirty (30) days after the issuance of an uncontested administrative citation or, if contested, within thirty (30) days after an order to pay pursuant to a decision by a hearing officer or judicial officer confirming the fine, shall also result in the imposition of an interest charge at a rate established by resolution of the City Council. Interest shall not accrue on a late penalty charge or reinspection fee. The rate of interest may be modified from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
D.  Administrative fines, reinspection fees, late penalty charges, investigation, and abatement costs, and any interest due shall be paid to the city at such location or address as stated in the citation, or as may otherwise be designated by the City Manager. 
E.  Payment of an administrative fine shall not excuse or discharge a citee from the duty to immediately abate a violation of the code, nor from any other responsibility or legal consequences for a continuation or repeated occurrence(s) of a violation of the code. 
F.  Abatement of a violation shall not excuse the obligation of a citee to pay an administrative fine or any other charges, fees, or costs imposed as a result of the issuance of a citation. 
G.  Unpaid administrative fines and other charges, fees, or costs imposed in accordance with this chapter shall constitute a debt that may be collected in any manner allowed by law, including, but not limited to: (1) the filing of a civil action in the Los Angeles Superior Court; and/or (2) the recordation of a lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office against citee-owned property that was the subject of the citation in the manner set forth in EMMC Section 1.19.040; and/or (3) by means of a special assessment against citee-owned property that was the subject of the citation in the manner set forth in EMMC Section 1.19.050; and/or (4) by means of collecting the debt using the California Franchise Tax Board "Inter-Agency Offset Program" (pursuant to Section 12419.10 of the California Government Code); and/or (5) by denying the issuance or renewal, in the manner set forth in EMMC Section 1.18.110, of any city approval, entitlement, license or permit to any citee who has failed to tender all unpaid administrative fines, late penalty charges, interest charges, or reinspection fees. The city shall be entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs arising from an action to collect an administrative fine and other charges, fees, or costs imposed in accordance with this chapter, if it is the prevailing party and provided it made the election to seek attorney's fees at the commencement of the action. A citee shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney's fees if the city made the election to seek attorney's fees at the outset of the action and the citee prevails thereon. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015)  
1.18.060 - Right to an administrative hearing. 
A.  Any citee may contest the violation(s), or that he or she is a responsible person, by filing an application requesting an administrative hearing on such forms as may be approved by the city. The appeal application shall be filed with the department or entity designated by the city on the application form. Application forms shall be available on the city's internet homepage or at the offices of the Neighborhood Services Division during the city's regular business hours. A completed application form must be filed along with any required appeal fee that may be indicated in the application form within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the issuance date of a citation. If a citee fails to timely file an appeal application, the citee shall have waived his/her right to an appeal hearing and the citation shall be deemed final. Also, except as otherwise provided under Section 1.18.070, below, if an appeal application that does not also include any required appeal fee and/or the advance deposit in the amount of the fine(s) set forth in the citation, such applications shall be deemed incomplete and may be considered untimely if the required appeal fee and advance deposit are not also submitted within the 21-day filing period referenced in this paragraph, above. It is the responsibility of each citee to ensure that his or her appeal application is complete and that all required appeal fees and advance deposits have been submitted along with the appeal application. The city is under no obligation to notify a citee when he or she fails to include the requisite appeal fee or advance deposit with his or her application prior to the expiration of the 21-day period for filing appeal applications. 
B.  Citees who do not timely file a request to contest the violation(s) or who fail to also submit the advance deposit or any appeal fee shall have waived the right to a hearing and the citation shall be deemed final. 
C.  A written request for a hearing shall, at a minimum, contain the following: 
1.  The citation number; 
2.  The name, address, telephone and any facsimile number and/or e-mail address, of the person contesting the citation; 
3.  A written statement explaining the factual and/or legal grounds upon which the city's issuance of the citation is being challenged by the citee along with any other documentary evidence the citee believes supports his/her challenge to the citation; and 
4.  The date and signature of the citee(s). 
D.  Except as otherwise authorized under Section 1.18.070, below, written requests for a hearing shall be accompanied by an advance deposit of the entire amount of the administrative fine stated in the citation. Failure to submit the deposit in the fine amount with the written request for hearing within the required period for filing the written request for hearing, shall render the application request for an administrative hearing incomplete and untimely, in which case the citee shall have waived the right to a hearing and the citation shall be deemed final. Fine deposits shall not accrue interest. Fine deposits shall be returned to the citee for those violations alleged in the citation that are overturned by the Hearing Officer or dismissed by the city. 
E.  A timely request for a hearing shall not excuse a citee from the duty to immediately abate a violation of the code, nor from any other responsibility or legal consequences for a continuation or repeated occurrence(s) of a violation of the code. 
F.  For purposes of Sections 1.18.060 through 1.18.90, where any deadline specifies that an application, deposit, fee or other item must be submitted or filed with the city or an entity designated by the city within a specified period of time, such application, deposit, fee or other items shall be deemed submitted or filed on the date it is actually received by and in the possession of the city or designated entity. Accordingly, if an application, deposit, fee or other item is deposited in the mail or given to a courier services for delivery to the city or the city's designated entity, such application, deposit, fee or other item shall not be considered submitted or filed until it is actually received by, and in the possession of, the city or the city's designated entity. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015; Ord. No. 2938, § 4, 11-20-2018)  
1.18.070 - Waiver of requirement to advance fine deposit. 
A.  If a citee who challenges a citation pursuant to Section 1.18.060, above, also contends that he or she is financially unable to submit the advance deposit required under subdivision D. of Section 1.18.070, above, the citee may also submit a separate application requesting that the city waive the requirement to advance such deposit along with the appeal application. The application to request a waiver of the requirement to submit an advance deposit shall be accompanied by documentation and other evidence which the citee believes supports his or her waiver request. The City Manager shall administratively designate which city employees shall have standing authority to review, evaluate and act on such waiver requests. Nothing in this section shall operate to waive a citee's obligation to pay any and all fine amounts due should a citation be upheld on appeal. 
B.  To be considered for a waiver, the citee's waiver application must be complete, signed by the citee, and must be accompanied by documents that enable the city to reasonably evaluate the citee's present inability to advance the deposit sums in the amount of the administrative fine. Documents suitable for such consideration may include, without limitation, accurate, complete and legible copies of state and federal income tax returns and all schedules for the preceding tax year; financial statements, loan applications, bank account records, income and expense records for twelve (12) months preceding submittal of the waiver form, as well as other documentation demonstrating the citee's financial hardship. The city may, in its sole discretion, request additional documents in order to determine a citee's financial ability to tender an advance deposit of the fine. Failure to submit sufficient evidence of a citee's financial inability to tender an advance deposit of the fine shall result in a denial of the hardship waiver. 
C.  The city shall issue a written decision regarding the application for a waiver within ten (10) calendar days from the date the waiver application is submitted. If the hardship waiver is denied, the written decision shall specify the reasons for the denial. Decisions regarding waiver requests are final and non-appealable. If a waiver request is denied, the citee shall tender the full amount of the advance deposit at the location specified in the denial notice and by the date and time specified in the denial notice. The failure of the citee to timely submit such advance deposit following the denial of a waiver request shall result in the appeal request being deemed incomplete and untimely and the citation shall be deemed final. 
D.  The city may, at a time chosen in its sole discretion and after a citation is final or confirmed, destroy or discard the documents submitted by a citee for a hardship waiver without prior notice to the citee. 
E.  All notices, including notices of decision to be issued by the city under this section may be issued by city personnel or by any entity under contract with the city to process and review. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015; Ord. No. 2938, § 5, 11-20-2018)  
1.18.080 - Administrative hearingProcedures. 
A.  An administrative appeal hearing shall be set for a date that is not less than fifteen (15) calendar days and not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date a timely and complete appeal application is received as provided under Section 1.18.060, above. A citee who files a request for an administrative hearing to challenge the issuance of a citation (hereafter "appellant") shall be notified in writing by first class mail of the date, time, and location of the hearing at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. The failure of an appellant to receive a properly addressed notice shall not invalidate the citation or any hearing or city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter. 
B.  At the place and time set forth in the notification of administrative hearing, the Hearing Officer shall hear and consider the testimony of the Issuing Officer, the appellant(s), and/or their witnesses, as well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the violation(s) alleged in the citation. 
C.  Administrative hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a violation and responsibility therefor by a preponderance of evidence. The issuance of an administrative citation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation. The appellant(s), and officer, if present, shall have an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. An appellant and the officer issuing the citation may represent himself/herself/themselves or be represented by anyone of his/her/their choice. An appellant may bring an interpreter to the hearing at the appellant's sole expense. The city may, at its discretion, record the hearing by stenographer or court reporter, audio recording, or video recording. The Hearing Officer may question any person who presents evidence or who testifies at any hearing. 
D.  An appellant may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration executed under penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any documents in support thereof shall be tendered to and received by the city at a return address indicated in the hearing notice referenced under subdivision A of Section 1.18.080, above, at least seven (7) city business days prior to the hearing. For purposes of this section "city business days" means Monday through Thursday and excludes Saturday, Sunday and Friday and any other date in which the City is closed for business. If an appellant elects to appear at the hearing by written declaration, the Issuing Officer who issued the citation shall not be required to attend or participate at the hearing. If the appellant fails to attend the scheduled hearing, or to otherwise submit a written declaration in a timely manner, the hearing shall be canceled and notice thereof shall be mailed to the appellant(s) by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing due to nonappearance of the appellant shall constitute the appellant's waiver of the right to appeal. In such instances, the citation (and corresponding fine and other applicable fees) shall be deemed final. The term "Issuing Officer" shall refer to the city employee who issued the citation under dispute, and may include, without limitation, a sworn officer of the El Monte Police Department, an official of the El Monte Neighborhood Services Division dully authorized to issue administrative citations on behalf of the city or any other city employee duly authorized by the city to issue citations on the city's behalf. 
E.  Hearings may be continued once at the request of an appellant or the Issuing Officer who issued the citation. The Hearing Officer may also continue the hearing for cause.

1.18.090 - Hearing officer decisionRight of appeal therefrom. 
A.  After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision to uphold or overturn the citation and shall state the reasons therefor. The city shall preserve all exhibits and evidence submitted at the hearing until all appeals have been exhausted. If the citation is upheld and the violation has not been fully corrected as of the date of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall order correction thereof in the decision and provide a deadline to complete said action(s). The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be final. If the citation is upheld and the appellant did not deposit the fine at the time the appellant requested an administrative appeal hearing, the Hearing Officer shall also order the payment of the fine (and other applicable fees and costs) within twenty (20) calendar days of the decision. 
B.  The appellant(s) shall be served by first class mail with a copy of the Hearing Officer's written decision. The date the decision is deposited with the U.S. Postal Service shall constitute the date of its service. The failure of an appellant to receive a properly addressed decision shall not invalidate any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter. 
C.  Decisions of the Hearing Officer are, in accordance with Government Code Section 53069.4(b), appealable to the superior court within twenty (20) days after the date of their service. Each decision shall contain a statement advising the appellant(s) of this appeal right and the procedures and court filing fee for its exercise. As required under Government Code Section 53069.4(b), the appellant shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal upon the city at the Office of the City Clerk. Such service may be made in person during the City's regular business hours or by first-class mail, provided that in both instances the notice of appeal must be received by the Office of the City Clerk within five (5) calendar days after the filing of the original court filed notice of appeal. Service upon any other division or department of the city, other than the Office of the City Clerk, shall be deemed defective. 
D.  If a Hearing Officer's decision is not appealed in a timely manner, the decision shall be deemed confirmed. 
E.  The superior court is the sole reviewing authority and an appeal from a Hearing Officer's decision is not appealable to the City Council. If an appellant prevails on appeal to the Superior Court, the city shall order the reimbursement of his or her filing fee, as well as the fine deposit in accordance with the court judgment. These monies shall be mailed to the appellant within forty-five (45) calendar days after the city's receipt of a notice of judgment or ruling from the Superior Court Clerk. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015; Ord. No. 2938, § 7, 11-20-2018)  
1.18.100 - Denial of city approvals, entitlements, licenses and permits for delinquent administrative citation fines, late penalty and interest charges, as well as for unpaid reinspection fees. 
A.  Cause to Deny Approvals, Entitlements, Licenses and Permits. The city may deny any city approval, entitlement, license, permit, or renewal thereof, due to the citee's nonpayment of all fines, late penalties and interest charges, as well as reinspection fees (hereafter, collectively, the "debt") that are due in connection with an uncontested citation, or with a final or confirmed citation. 
1.  The city's election not to exercise this remedy and to alternatively issue an approval, entitlement, license, permit, or renewal thereof does not constitute a satisfaction, discharge, or waiver of the debt. The issuance of any approval, entitlement, license or permit does not bar the city from denying the issuance of a different city approval, entitlement, license, permit, or renewal thereof, nor the election to use any other remedy to collect the debt. 
B.  Notice Denying an Approval Due to an Unpaid Debt. The department charged with receiving an application for a city approval, license, permit or entitlement, or renewal thereof, may, within five (5) business days after receiving an application, issue a written notice of denial to the citee and to the applicant therefor (hereafter in this section, collectively, the "citee"), stating that the application is denied for failure to pay the debt (a summary accounting for which shall be included therein). The notice shall also contain information concerning the right to appeal the denial and the time period and manner in which to do so. 
C.  Service of Notice. The notice issued under this section shall be served by first class mail to the citee. The date of its placement in a United States postal container shall be the date of service. Failure of the citee to receive a properly addressed notice shall not invalidate any action under this section. 
D.  Appeal. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the code, a citee seeking to appeal a denial pursuant to this section (hereafter the "appellant") may not challenge or contest the underlying basis for the issuance of the citation or citations that gave rise to the debt. For any other reasons to appeal a denial pursuant to this section, appellant shall file a written notice of appeal with the Office of the City Clerk, El Monte City Hall, 11333 Valley Boulevard, El Monte, CA 91731 within ten (10) calendar days of the date of service of the notice that contains the following information: 
1.  The full name, address and telephone number for each person filing the appeal. 
2.  The grounds for the appeal, including, if applicable, a completed or pending bankruptcy action whereby the debt has been discharged, or is subject to discharge. 
3.  A copy of the notice of denial that was issued pursuant to this section. 
Payment of a fee is not required for an appeal under this section. If the office of the City Clerk does not receive a notice of appeal in the required period, the appellant shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the denial. The appeal procedure in this section shall supersede all other appeal procedures in the code. 
The procedure outlined in this section shall be the only method of challenging a denial of a city approval, license, permit or entitlement, or renewal thereof, that was based solely on the city's contention that the citee has an outstanding debt. 
E.  Notice of Appeal Hearing. Upon receipt of a timely notice of appeal, the office of the City Clerk shall issue a notice of hearing before the hearing officer, via first class mail to the appellant at the address shown in the application. An appeal hearing shall be set within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the notice of appeal. 
1.  The date the notice of hearing is deposited in a United States postal container shall constitute the date of service. 
2.  The notice shall include the date, time, and location of the hearing, which must be no sooner than ten (10) calendar, days after the date of service of the notice of hearing. 
3.  The failure of an appellant to receive a properly addressed notice of hearing shall not invalidate any action under this section. 
F.  Administrative Appeal HearingProcedure. 
1.  At the place and time set forth in the notice of hearing, the hearing officer shall hear and consider the testimony of the appellant(s) and/or their witnesses, and of the representative, if present, of the department that issued the denial of the application, as well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the denial of the application. 
2.  This administrative hearing is informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The appellant bears the burden of proving he/she/it is not the citee that owes the debt, or that the entire debt has been paid to the city, or that the debt has been discharged in a bankruptcy action, or is subject to discharge in a pending bankruptcy action. The appellant(s), and department representative, if present, shall have an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. An appellant may bring an interpreter to the hearing at the appellant's sole expense. The hearing officer may question any person who presents evidence or who testifies at any hearing. 
3.  Failure of the appellant, or a representative thereof, to attend the hearing shall result in the hearing officer canceling the hearing and sending a notice thereof to the appellant by first class mail to the address stated in the appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing due to nonappearance of the appellant shall constitute the appellant's waiver of the right to appeal. In such instances, the denial of the application shall be deemed final, without right of appeal to the City Council. 
4.  Hearings may be continued once at the request of the appellant or the department who issued the denial of application. The hearing officer may also continue the hearing for cause. 
G.  Decision of Hearing OfficerNotice Thereof. 
1.  The hearing officer shall consider the evidence and testimony in reaching a decision, but shall not consider testimony or evidence that constitutes a challenge to the underlying basis for the issuance of a citation or citations that gave rise to the debt in rendering a decision. 
2.  The hearing officer shall affirm the denial of application if he or she determines the appellant is the citee with regard to the unpaid citation(s), and the entire debt has not been paid to the city. 
3.  The hearing officer shall overrule the denial of application if he or she determines: (a) the appellant is not the citee with regard to the unpaid citation(s); or (b) the entire debt has been paid to the city; or (c) the debt has been discharged, or is subject to discharge in a pending bankruptcy action, as established with satisfactory evidence of the appellant at the appeal hearing. 
4.  The appellant shall be served by first class mail with a copy of the hearing officer's written decision. 
5.  The decision shall be deemed final, without right of appeal to the City Council. 
A decision by a hearing officer to grant an appeal (i.e., to overturn the denial of a city approval, entitlement, license, permit, or renewal thereof) on any basis other than the debt having been paid or otherwise discharged by a bankruptcy does not constitute a satisfaction, discharge, or waiver of the debt, nor does such a decision bar the city from denying the issuance of a different city approval, entitlement, license, permit, or renewal thereof, nor the election to use any other remedy to collect the debt. 
H.  Effect on Existing Approvals, Entitlements, Licenses and Permits Pending Appeal. When the holder of a city approval, entitlement, license, or permit is notified in accordance with subsection B of this section that such approval, entitlement, license or permit will not be renewed unless a debt is paid, the approval, entitlement, license or permit shall remain in effect during the pendency of the appeal process described in subsections F and G of this section. When an approval, entitlement, license or permit is found to be eligible for renewal, through the appeal process, it shall remain in effect until the renewal is issued. When an approval, entitlement, license or permit is found to be ineligible for renewal, through the appeal process, it shall expire at such time as the holder has exhausted or failed to exhaust the appeal procedures described in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 2, 9-15-2015)  
1.18.110 - Penalties. 
Failure of a citee to comply with a corrective action within the time stated in any uncontested citation, or with regard to a correction order in any hearing officer decision that is deemed confirmed and not appealed to the superior court, or with regard to a correction order appealed to and upheld by the superior court, shall constitute a misdemeanor. A citee's willful nonpayment of administrative fines, late penalty charges, interest charges, other investigative fees, attorney's fees, or reinspection fees shall constitute a misdemeanor.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2865, § 3, adopted Sept. 15, 2015, repealed Ch. 1.19 and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 1.19, §§ 1.19.0101.19.190, pertained to administrative compliance citations and derived from Ord. 2542, § 2(part), adopted in 2001, and Ord. 2258, § 9, adopted 2002. 
 
1.19.010 - Enforcement. 
In addition to those public officers and employees authorized by state law, this code and any other ordinances of the city may be enforced by the Police Department of the city, city personnel designated by job description as being responsible for enforcement of the municipal code, and the City Manager or designee thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 3, 9-15-2015)  
1.19.020 - Recovery of code enforcement fees. 
The City Council finds and declares as follows: 
A.  Pursuant to California Government Code Section 54988 and California Health and Safety Code Section 17951 (and any successor statutes thereto), the El Monte building code, and any other applicable local, state, or federal law, as well as by the city's police powers as authorized by the California Constitution, responsible persons, who cause, allow, permit, suffer, or maintain a violation in, or upon, any real property located within the city, shall be charged fees (hereafter "code enforcement fees") by the city to defray its costs of code enforcement actions. 
Such fees shall not exceed the amount reasonably required to achieve this objective and are chargeable whether the city's code enforcement actions occur in the absence of formal administrative or judicial proceedings, as well as prior to, during, or subsequent to the initiation of such proceedings. 
1.  As used herein, "responsible person" means and includes any person that causes, creates, allows, permits, suffers, or maintains a public nuisance to exist or continue within the city, by any act or the omission of any act or duty, including, but not limited to, any person having legal title to, or who leases, rents, occupies or has charge, control or possession of, any real property in the city, including all persons shown as owners on the last equalized assessment roll of the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office. A responsible person shall also include, but shall not be limited to, employees, principals, joint venturers, officers, agents, and/or other persons acting in concert with, or at the direction of, and/or with the knowledge and/or consent of the owner and/or occupant of the lot, building or structure on, or in, which a public nuisance or violation exists or existed, as well as any persons with powers of attorney, executors of estates, trustees, or who are court-appointed administrators, conservators, guardians or receivers. "Responsible person," with regard to personal property, shall be any person who has legal title, charge, control, or possession of such property. The actions or inactions of a responsible person's agent, employee, representative or contractor may be attributed to that responsible person. 
2.  "Public nuisance" or "nuisance" means anything which is, or is likely to become, injurious or detrimental to health, safety or welfare, or is offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or that unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any sidewalk, public park, square, street or highway. Any condition, use, or activity that violates or is otherwise contrary to any provision of this code or any approval, license, permit, or other entitlement issued pursuant to or in accordance with this code, or that violates or is contrary to any applicable county, state, or federal law or regulation, shall also constitute a public nuisance. 
3.  As used herein, "violation" means and includes any prohibited activity, condition, or use on land or in connection with a building or a structure that is caused, allowed to exist, or maintained (whether due to an affirmative act, inaction, or omission) by a responsible person in disregard of, or nonconformity with, any other provision, regulation, prohibition, or requirement of the El Monte Municipal Code, or any applicable county, state, or federal laws or regulations. Any such violation shall also constitute an unlawful public nuisance for each and every day or part thereof during which it is allowed, committed, continued, maintained or permitted by a responsible person. 
4.  As used herein, "code enforcement fees" shall mean fees imposed by the city to defray its costs of code enforcement actions, pursuant to California Government Code Section 54988 and California Health and Safety Code Section 17951 (and any successor statutes thereto), the El Monte building code, and any other applicable local, state, or federal law, as well as by the city's police powers as authorized by the California Constitution, including, but not limited to, the time and other resources of public officials and city consultants expended by them in identifying, inspecting, investigating, seeking or causing the abatement of a violation at a real property. Examples of code enforcement actions include, but are not limited to, site inspections, drafting reports, taking photographs, procuring other evidence, engaging in meetings with other officials of the city or other agencies, engaging in conferences and communications with responsible persons, their agents or representatives, concerning a violation, as well as with attorneys for the city at any time, and appearances before judicial officers or reviewing authorities during the commencement or pendency of a judicial or administrative hearing. The time and resources that public officials and city consultants further expend to confirm that a real property remains free of a violation while a responsible person is on probation to a court or when a matter concerning a property remains pending before a reviewing authority in an administrative action shall also constitute code enforcement actions. 
B.  The amount(s) or rate(s) of code enforcement fees for city personnel time and other resources that are used for code enforcement actions shall be established, and may thereafter be amended, by resolution of the City Council. 
C.  The City Manager, or a designee thereof, is authorized to adopt regulations for the uniform imposition of code enforcement fees, and for related administrative actions pertaining to such fees. 
D.  The fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other fines, fees, interest or charges that responsible persons may owe in accordance with any other provision of the El Monte Municipal Code, or which are imposed pursuant to county, state or federal laws or regulations. 
E.  Code enforcement fees shall be recoverable in conjunction with any civil, administrative or criminal action to abate, cause the abatement or cessation of, or otherwise remove, a violation as defined in this section. 
1.  In every instance where an owner or other responsible person is required to obtain a permit, approval, license or entitlement under any provision of the El Monte Municipal Code in connection with the abatement of a violation, the city may condition the issuance of said permit, approval, license or entitlement on the prior payment of all code enforcement fees. 
F.  Unpaid code enforcement fees shall constitute a debt that is collectible in any manner allowed by law, including, but not limited to: (1) the filing of a civil action in the Los Angeles Superior Court; and/or (2) the recordation of a lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office provided the responsible person has a legal interest in the property on which the violation was located; and/or (3) by means of a special assessment provided the responsible person has a legal interest in the property on which the violation was located; and/or (4) by means of collecting the debt using the California Franchise Tax Board "Inter-Agency Offset Program" (pursuant to Section 12419.10 of the California Government Code); and/or (5) by denying the issuance or renewal, pursuant to EMMC Section 1.18.110, of any city approval, license, entitlement, or permit to any responsible person who has failed to pay code enforcement fees that are imposed pursuant to this section. The remedies may be concurrently used to collect unpaid code enforcement fees. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 3, 9-15-2015)  
1.19.030 - Recovery of attorney's fees. 
A.  A prevailing party in any action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding to abate, or cause the abatement of, a violation of this code or any public nuisance, or in any appeal or other judicial action arising therefrom, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees. Attorney's fees are not recoverable by any person as a prevailing party unless the City Manager, or a designee thereof, or an attorney for, and on behalf of, the city, elects in writing to seek recovery of the city's attorney's fees at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding. Failure to make such an election precludes any entitlement to, or award of, attorney's fees in favor of any person or the city. 
B.  Provided that the city has made an election to seek attorney's fees, an award of attorney's fees to a person shall not exceed the amount of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city in that action or proceeding. 
C.  Unpaid attorney's fees shall constitute a debt that is collectible in any manner allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 3, 9-15-2015)  
1.19.040 - Uniform lien procedures. 
A.  Unless a different procedure is authorized elsewhere in this code, where the code authorizes the city to record a lien for any unpaid fee, cost, charge, or other monies, the following procedures shall apply: 
1.  A lien may be recorded upon real property that is the subject of enforcement activity if the fine, fee, cost, charge, or other monies resulting from said enforcement activity are not paid within forty-five (45) calendar days of written notice thereof. This section shall not apply to owner-occupied residential dwelling unit(s) pursuant to Government Code Section 54988. 
a.  Said notice must have advised the owner(s) of the subject property in plain language of the city's intent to record a lien if the fine, fee, cost, charge, or other monies were not paid within forty-five (45) calendar days, the amount of the proposed lien, a description of the basis for the amount(s) comprising the lien, and an opportunity to appear before the City Council (or designee thereof) and to be heard regarding the amount of the proposed lien. 
b.  Where the City Council designates another hearing body should the property owner(s) exercise his/her/their right to be heard, the hearing body shall make a written recommendation to the City Council that shall include factual findings based on evidence introduced at the hearing. The City Council may adopt the recommendation without further notice of hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing before the City Council. Notice in writing of the de novo hearing shall be provided to the property owner(s) at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the scheduled hearing. 
2.  The lien shall be recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien. 
3.  A lien authorized by this section shall specify the amount of the lien for the city, the name of the city department or division on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date upon which the lien was created, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. 
4.  In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the information specified in subsection (A)(3) of this section shall be recorded by the city. A lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed in the grantor-grantee index. 
5.  A lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money judgment. 
6.  The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien, providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien, and of pursuing a foreclosure action to enforce the lien. 
(Ord. No. 2865, § 3, 9-15-2015)  
1.19.050 - Uniform special assessment procedures. 
A.  Unless a different procedure is authorized elsewhere in this code, where the code authorizes the city to impose a special assessment for any unpaid fee, cost, charge, or other monies, the following procedures shall apply: 
1.  A special assessment may be imposed upon real property that is the subject of enforcement activity if the fine, fee, cost, charge, or other monies resulting from said enforcement activity are not paid within forty-five (45) calendar days of written notice thereof. 
a.  Said notice must have advised the owner(s) of the subject property in plain language of the city's intent to impose a special assessment if the fine, fee, cost, charge, or other monies were not paid within forty-five (45) calendar days, the amount of the proposed assessment, a description of the basis for the amount(s) comprising the assessment, and an opportunity to appear before the City Council (or designee thereof) and to be heard regarding the amount of the proposed assessment. 
b.  Where the City Council designates another hearing body should the property owner(s) exercise his/her/their right to be heard, the hearing body shall make a written recommendation to the City Council that shall include factual findings based on evidence introduced at the hearing. The City Council may adopt the recommendation without further notice of hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing before the City Council. Notice in writing of the de novo hearing shall be provided to the property owner(s) at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the scheduled hearing. 
2.  The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of ad valorem taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment, except that if any real property to which the assessment would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the assessment that would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to the real property and instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
3.  A notice of special assessment shall be sent to the owner(s) of the subject real property by certified mail at the time the assessment is imposed which shall contain the following recitals: 
The property may be sold after three (3) years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. 
4.  The city attorney or city prosecutor shall establish the notice of special assessment form for use, or consideration, by the tax collector for the city in collecting a special assessment. 
5.  The notice of special assessment shall also be entitled to recordation with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office. 
6.  It shall be the duty of the City Manager (or designee thereof) to add the amounts of the assessment, or assessments, to the next regular bills for taxes levied against the respective real property in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Los Angeles County Department of Auditor-Controller. Failure of the cite to receive the notice of special assessment shall not invalidate these proceedings. 
7.  The amount of a special assessment shall also constitute a personal obligation of the owner's subject property.

Chapter 1.20 - ADMINISTRATIVE INSPECTIONS

Upon a determination by the City Attorney, City Administrator and Planning Director that sufficient cause exists for the city to seek an administrative inspection warrant for the purpose of determining the existence or nonexistence of any violation of this code or of any code adopted by reference in this code, the city may, after due notice as set forth herein, file a notice of intent to inspect real property with the Recorder's Office of the county of Los Angeles thereby putting all persons on notice that the city has determined that cause exists to believe that violations of the El Monte Municipal Code may exist on the indicated real property and that the city intends to seek an administrative inspection warrant for said premises.

Any notice of intent to inspect filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder shall automatically expire and be self-vacating ninety (90) days after being recorded. Any administrative inspection warranted acquired by the city for a property for which a notice of intent to inspect has been recorded shall be filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder and itself shall automatically expire and be self-vacating ninety (90) days after being recorded.

E.  Leave of Absence. The City Manager may grant a regular employee leave of absence with or without pay not to exceed one year. No such leave shall be granted except upon written request of the employee. Approval shall be in writing and a copy filed with the Human Resources Officer. Upon expiration of a regularly approved leave, or within a reasonable period of time after notice to return to duty, the employee shall be reinstated in the position held at the time leave was granted. Failure on the part of an employee on leave to report promptly at its expiration, or within a reasonable time after notice to return to duty, shall be cause for discipline. 
F.  Hours of Work. All offices of the city, except those for which special regulations are required, shall be kept open for business on all days outlined in the appropriate governing Memoranda of Understanding or in accordance with regulations prepared by the appropriate Department Head. 
G.  Attendance. Employees shall be in attendance at their work in accordance with the rules regarding hours of work, holidays, and leaves. All departments shall keep daily attendance records of employees which shall be reported to the Human Resources Officer in the form and on the dates specified. Failure on the part of an employee, absent without leave, to return to duty within twenty-four (24) hours after notice to return shall be cause for immediate discharge, and such employee automatically waives all rights under the Personnel Ordinance and Rules. 
H.  Holidays. All probationary and permanent regular employees employed on a weekly, semi-monthly or monthly pay basis shall be entitled to holidays with pay in accordance with the appropriate governing Memorandum of Understanding. 
1.  No employee shall be entitled to compensation for any holiday herein specified unless such an employee has been employed by the city on the day preceding and the day following such holiday. Employees who are on voluntary, unpaid leave on the day preceding or the day after the holiday shall not receive holiday pay. 
I.  Maternity Leave. Maternity leave shall be granted in accordance with Government Code Section 12945(b)(2), as amended. As currently written, state law requires the city to provide up to four (4) months leave of absence for pregnancies, childbirth or related medical conditions upon medical certification of a pregnant employee's inability to continue working (i.e., disability). Maternity leave as defined in this section is in addition to the leave requirements of the Family Medical Leave policy as outlined in the following section. 
J.  Family Medical Leave. 
1.  Statement of Policy. In accordance with the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) the City of El Monte will provide family and medical care leave for eligible employees, as defined. 
2.  Definitions. 
a.  "12-Month Period" means a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date leave is taken and continuous with each additional leave day taken. 
b.  "Child" means a child under the age of 18 years of age, or 18 years of age or older who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability. An employee's child is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes, a biological, adopted, foster or step-child. 
c.  "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves: 
i.  Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or in consequent to a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility; 
ii.  Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work of more than three (3) calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider; 
iii.  Continuing treatment of a health care provider for a chronic or long term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or 
iv.  Prenatal care by a health provider. 
d.  "Continuing treatments" means: 
i.  Two (2) or more visits to a health care provider; 
ii.  Two (2) or more treatments by a health care practitioner (e.g. physical therapist) on referral from, or under the direction of a health care provider or; 
iii.  A single visit to a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider (e.g. medication therapy). 
3.  Reasons for Leave. Leave is only permitted for the following reasons: 
a.  The birth of a child or to care for a newborn of an employee; 
b.  The placement of a child with an employee in connection with the adoption or foster care of the child; 
c.  Leave to care for a child, parent, or a spouse who has a serious health condition; or 
d.  Leave because of the serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his/her position. 
4.  Employees Eligible for Leave. An employee is eligible for leave if the employee has been employed for at least six (6) calendar months. 
5.  Amount of Leave. Eligible employees are entitled to a total of four hundred eighty (480) hours of leave in any twelve (12) month period. An employee's entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care expires twelve (12) months after the birth or placement. 
6.  Employee Benefits While on Leave. Leave under this policy is unpaid. While on leave, employees will continue to be covered by the City of El Monte's group health insurance to the same extent that coverage is provided while the employee is on the job. Employees may make the appropriate contributions for continued coverage under the preceding benefit plans by payroll deductions or direct payments made to these plans. Employee contribution rates are subject to any change in rates that occurs while the employee is on leave. 
7.  Substitution of Paid Accrued Leaves. If an employee requests leave for any reason permitted under this policy, he/she must exhaust all accrued leaves (except sick leave) in connection with the leave. The exhaustion of accrued leave will run concurrently with the leave under this policy. If an employee requests leave for his/her own serious health condition, in addition to exhausting accrued leave, the employee must also exhaust sick leave. 
8.  Medical Verification. Employees who request leave for their own serious health condition or to care for a child, parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition must provide written certification from the health care provider of the individual requiring care. If the leave is requested because of the employee's own serious health condition, the certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her position. 
a.  If the City of El Monte has reason to doubt the validity of a certification, the city may require a medial opinion of a second health care provider chosen by the city. If the second opinion is different from the first, the city may require the opinion of a third provider jointly approved by the city and the employee. The opinion of the third provider will be binding. 
b.  If an employee requests leave intermittently (a few days or hours at a time) or on a reduced leave schedule to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, the employee must provide medical certification that such leave is medically necessary. "Medically necessary" means there must be a medical need for the leave and that the leave can be best accomplished through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. 
9.  Employee Notice of Leave. Although the City of El Monte recognizes that emergencies arise which may require employees to request immediate leave, employees are required to give as much notice as possible of their need for leave. If leave is foreseeable, at least thirty (30) days notice is required. In addition, if an employee knows that he/she will need leave in the future, but does not know the exact date(s) (e.g. for the birth of a child or to take care of a newborn), the employee shall inform his/her supervisor as soon as possible that such leave will be needed. If the city determines that an employee's notice is inadequate or the employee knew about the requested leave in advance of the request, the city may delay the granting of the leave until it can, in its discretion adequately cover the position with a substitute. 
10.  Reinstatement Upon Return from Leave. Upon expiration of leave, an employee is entitled to be restored to the position of employment held when the leave commenced, or to an equivalent position. 
11.  As a condition of restoration of an employee whose leave was due to the employee's own serious health condition, which made the employee unable to perform his/her job, the employee must obtain and present a fitness-for-duty certification from the health care provider that the employee is able to work. Failure to provide such certification will result in denial of restoration. 
12.  Employees must fill out the applicable forms in connection with leave under this policy. 
K.  Police Department Holidays. The Police Department, being a safety department of city government, and working twenty-four hours per day, three hundred sixty-five (365) days per year, is unable to take allowed holidays in the conventional manner. Therefore, holidays will be governed by the appropriate governing Memorandum of Understanding. 
(Ord. 2579 § 10, 2003)  
2.72.110 - Pay adjustments. 
A.  Application of Rates. Employees occupying a position in the competitive service shall be paid a salary or wage within the range established for that position's class under the pay plan as provided by Section 2.72.050. The minimum rate for the class generally shall apply to employees upon original appointment. However, the appointing power may, when circumstances warrant it, appoint at other than the first step. Lateral transfers shall not affect an employee's salary rate. 
B.  Acting Pay. Shall be governed by the appropriate governing Memorandum of Understanding. 
(Ord. 2579 § 11, 2003)  
2.72.120 - Transfer, promotion, demotion, suspension and reinstatement. 
A.  Transfer. After notice to the Human Resources Officer, an employee may be transferred by the appointing power at any time from one position to another position in the same or comparable class. If the transfer involves a change form from the jurisdiction of one supervising official to another, the incoming department head must consent thereto unless the appointing power orders the transfer for purposes of economy or efficiency. Transfer shall not be used to effectuate a promotion, demotion, advancement, or reduction, each of which may be accomplished only as provided in the personnel ordinance and in these rules. No person shall be transferred to a position for which he/she does not possess the minimum qualifications. 
1.  An employee may also initiate a transfer to another position in the same or lower classification at the same or a lower salary for which they are qualified. To accomplish such a transfer the employee must apply to the Human Resources Office. With the approval of the Department Head for whom the employee requests to work, the employee shall be transferred when the first vacancy occurs. 
B.  Promotion. It is the policy of the City of El Monte to develop the skills of current employees and to promote from within. However, if promotion from within would perpetuate adverse impact against classes protected by federal or state law, or if current employees are not sufficiently qualified to perform the current essential functions of the vacant position, the appointing authority after consulting with the Human Resources Officer, may call for an open, competitive examination. 
C.  Demotion. The appointing power may demote a regular employee whose performance falls below standard, or for other disciplinary purposes. No employee shall be demoted to a position for which the employee does not possess the minimum qualifications. Written notice of the demotion shall be given to the employee fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the demotion and a copy shall be filed with the Human Resources Officer. In all cases of involuntary demotion, the appointing power shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 2.72.140. Any regular employee may request voluntary demotion to any vacant position for which he/she is qualified. 
D.  Reinstatement. An employee who has resigned with a good record shall be reinstated within two years to his/her former position, if vacant, or to a position in the same or comparable class. If the employee is reinstated within thirty (30) calendar days, the employee is eligible for restoration of all unpaid benefits, however, the employee's anniversary date will be set forward one month. 
(Ord. 2579 § 12, 2003)  
2.72.130 - Non disciplinary separation from the service. 
A.  Lay-off. The appointing power may abolish a position within a class in the competitive service because of lack of work or lack of funds, which, in turn, may require the layoff of one or more employees. When a position within a class is abolished thereby necessitating a layoff, the following procedures shall be followed: 
1.  An employee shall be ranked by classification grouping in accordance with his/her appointment to the specific classification. Groupings in descending order are: 
a.  Police classification grouping (ranked from highest compensated to least compensated. Refer to Appendix I). 
b.  Miscellaneous classification grouping (ranked from highest compensated to least compensated. Refer to Appendix I). 
2.  Position reductions within classification groupings shall be in inverse classification seniority order with the least senior employee appointed to the classification affected first. 
3.  An affected employee shall be allowed to displace a less senior employee within any equal or descending classification within his/her grouping by an exercise of city seniority, providing such displacing employee is fully qualified to perform the essential functions of the displaced employee. No training other than familiarization/orientation shall be conducted by the city. An employee failing to qualify after displacing a less senior employee by an exercise of city seniority shall be laid off. 
4.  An employee who, by an exercise of city seniority, displaces a less senior employee shall be compensated at the step in the new classification equal to or closest to his/her present step rate of pay provided that no increase in base pay results. 
5.  An employee last holding a position of higher rank shall have first opportunity, by classification seniority to revert to a position classification formerly held whether such employee is temporarily displaced within the classification grouping or separated from the city through voluntary layoff. 
6.  An employee laid off by the city by the above reduction in force procedure shall be recalled in accordance with city seniority to a position within his/her former classification grouping, which he/she is qualified to perform. Recall shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
7.  No person outside the competitive service (with the exception of the City Manager) shall be assigned to perform the essential functions of a position from which a regular employee was laid off, for more than sixty (60) days. Whenever possible the city shall lay off employees outside the competitive service before any layoffs of regular employees. 
B.  Resignation. An employee wishing to leave the competitive service in good standing shall file with the supervising official at least two (2) weeks before leaving the service, a written resignation stating the effective date and reasons for leaving. The resignation shall be forwarded to the Human Resources Officer with a statement by the appointing power or Department Head as to the resigned employee's service performance and other pertinent information concerning the cause for resignation. Failure to comply with this rule shall be entered on the service record of the employee and may be cause for denying future employment by the city. The resignation of an employee who fails to give notice shall be reported to the Human Resources Officer by the Department Head immediately. 
(Ord. 2579 § 13, 2003)  
2.72.140 - Disciplinary actions. 
A.  Cause and Extent. Disciplinary action may be taken against a regular employee for cause. The extent of the disciplinary action taken shall be commensurate with the offense, and the prior employment history of the employee. Exempt employees, outside the competitive service, serve at the will of the appointing power and may be disciplined at any time without cause or rights of appeal. 
B.  Kinds of Action. The disciplinary actions that may be taken are dismissal, demotion, suspension, reduction in step within a range, written reprimand or any appropriate combination of these.

8.  Inexcusable absence without leave. 
9.  Abuse of sick leave, i.e., taking sick leave without a doctor's certificate when one is required, or misuse of sick leave. 
10.  The conviction of either a misdemeanor or a felony involving moral turpitude shall constitute grounds for discipline of any employee. The record of conviction shall be conclusive evidence only of the fact that the conviction occurred. The Human Resources Officer and/or appointing power may inquire into the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime in order to fix the degree of discipline. 
11.  Discourteous treatment of the public or a co-worker. 
12.  Improper or unauthorized use of city property. 
13.  Violation of the rules and regulations published and posted in any department. 
14.  Refusal to subscribe to any oath or affirmation which is required by law in connection with city employment.

16.  Inattention to duty, tardiness, indolence, carelessness or negligence in the care and handling of city property. 
17.  Mental or physical infirmity or defects which render the employee unfit for the proper performance of his duties if no reasonable accommodation can be made. 
18.  Outside employment that interferes with the employee's performance of his/her city duties and which is not specifically authorized by the appointing power or City Manager. Prior to the imposition of any discipline under this provision, the employee will first be afforded the opportunity to give up the outside employment or modify it in a manner acceptable to the city. 
19.  The refusal of any employee of the city to appear when subpoenaed under oath before any Grand Jury having jurisdiction over any then pending cause or inquiry in which the investigation of government bribery or misconduct in city office is involved, shall constitute of itself sufficient ground for the discipline of such city employee. 
20.  Willful violation of any of the provisions of the ordinances, resolutions or any rules, regulations or policies which may be prescribed by the City Council or City Manager. 
21.  Improper political activity. Example: Those campaigning for the election or non-election of any candidate in national, state, county or municipal elections while on duty or in a city uniform on or off duty; or the dissemination of political material of any kind while on duty or in uniform. 
a.  Activities not affected. Nothing in these rules and regulations shall be construed to prevent any employee from becoming or continuing to be a member of a political club or organization, or from attendance at a political meeting, or from enjoying entire freedom from all interference in casting his/her vote or from seeking or accepting election or appointment to public office, provided however, that a person holding a position in the classified service must resign his/her position in the classified service upon being elected to the office of any elective office of the city. 
D.  Disciplinary Action, Authority to Take. 
1.  The City Manager shall have authority to take disciplinary action.

c.  A factual summary of the grounds upon which the charges are based; 
d.  Notice of the employee's right to respond to the charges either orally or in writing to the appointing power; 
e.  The employee's right to review and copy all the materials upon which the intended discipline is based; 
f.  The date, time and person before whom the employee may respond within ten (10) days; 
g.  A statement that the failure to respond at within the time specified in the Notice shall constitute a waiver of the right to respond prior to final discipline being implemented. 
2.  Final Notice. If, after the response or the expiration of the employee's time to respond to the Notice of Intent, the appointing power decides to proceed with the disciplinary action, a Final Notice shall be served upon the employee either in person or by certified mail which shall set forth the reasons for the discipline imposed, and the effective date thereof. 
3.  Removal of Employee from Duty. Where retention in active work status would be detrimental to the best interest of the city, the employee or other employees, the employee may be removed from duty immediately. However, such removal shall not cause the employee loss of pay or benefits. 
4.  Appeal for Employees. 
a.  Within ten (10) working days after service upon the employee of the final notice (fifteen (15) days if service is by certified mail), the employee may appeal the disciplinary action.

c.  An appeal shall contain a notice of the employee's intent to appeal, setting forth specific facts upon which the appeal is based, a specific reference to the disciplinary action upon which the appeal is taken and the nature of the relief sought. Every notice of appeal shall be signed by the employee or the employee's representative. If the employee will be represented during the appeal hearing, the employee shall identify his or her representative in the notice. 
d.  The City Manager, upon receipt of a timely appeal, which contains all of the required information, shall submit to the employee a list containing seven (7) names from the California State Mediation and Conciliation Office, one of whom shall act as Hearing Officer. The names shall be numbered consecutively. 
e.  Within ten (10) consecutive calendar days after service of the list containing the names, the employee and then the City Manager may alternate and strike one name from the list. 
f.  Upon expiration of the said ten (10) day period, the Hearing Officer shall be deemed for all purposes to be the Judge whose name appears on the list with the lowest number next to his or her name. 
g.  If no name remains on the list, another list of seven (7) new names shall be requested. Within ten (10) consecutive calendar days after service of the new list, the same process of alternate striking shall be followed. Upon expiration of said ten (10) day period, the Hearing Officer shall be deemed for all purposes to be the Judge whose name appears on the list with the lowest number next to his or her name. 
h.  If for any reason the person who is designated as Hearing Officer is unable or unwilling to serve as such, the name on the list with the next lower number and whose name was not stricken shall be Hearing Officer. In the event that none of those named on the list are unwilling or unable to serve as Hearing Officer, the City Manager shall prepare and submit a new list to the employee containing not less than seven (7) different names from the State Mediation and Conciliation Office. The above procedures shall be followed until a Hearing Officer is selected. 
i.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employee and the City Manager may mutually agree upon a qualified person to act as Hearing Officer. 
j.  The designated Hearing Officer shall set a time and place for the conduct of the de novo appeal hearing and shall give not less than fifteen (15) consecutive days notice thereof to the employee and to the appointing power. 
k.  Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare findings of fact and a determination, which shall include all of the issues presented by the appeal. The Hearing Officer shall serve a copy of the proposed findings and determination upon the employee and upon the appointing power. The findings and determination made by the Hearing Officer shall be deemed final and conclusive unless the employee or City Manager files a written appeal to the City Council within ten (10) consecutive calendar days following the service of the findings and determination upon the employee. Where a timely appeal is filed appealing the decision of the Hearing Officer to the City Council, a transcript of proceedings before the Hearing Officer shall be prepared which shall include all documents presented in evidence at the hearing, and including any document not accepted in evidence by determination of the Hearing Officer. The transcript together with the findings and determination of the Hearing Officer shall be transmitted to the City Council. The City Council shall set a time and a place for a hearing on the appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer. The action of the City Council on the appeal shall be limited to a review of the transcript and the submission by the parties of written or oral arguments in support of and/or in opposition to the Hearing Officer's findings and determination. The City Council shall not accept any further evidence unless there is a showing of good cause that the evidence proposed to be presented was not available at the time of the hearing before the Hearing Officer through no fault of the party offering the same. The City Council may consider the evidence in such a case or may refer the matter to the Hearing Officer for a further review based upon the evidence involved. 
l.  The City Council shall act upon the appeal based upon the transcript and such written or oral arguments, which have been presented to it by the parties. The City Council may overturn the determination of the Hearing Officer; or accept the same; or modify it in whole or in part. 
m.  The action of the City Council shall be final and conclusive subject only to judicial review. 
F.  Hearing Procedure. 
1.  All hearings before the Hearing Officer shall be conducted de novo and shall be closed unless the employee requests in writing five (5) days before the hearing that the hearing be open. 
2.  Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum may be issued by either party and shall be enforced by the Hearing Officer. 
3.  The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rules, which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil and criminal actions and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. The Hearing Officer shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The Hearing Officer shall rule on the admission or exclusion of evidence. 
4.  Each party shall have these rights: To be represented by legal counsel or other person of his or her choice; to call and examine witnesses; to introduce evidence; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination; to suspend for reconsideration; to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called him or her to testify; and to rebut the evidence against him or her. If the employee does not testify in his or her own behalf, he or she may be called and examined as if under cross-examination. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation. 
5.  The hearing shall proceed in the following order, unless the Hearing Officer for good cause, otherwise directs: 
a.  The appointing power shall be permitted to make an opening statement; 
b.  The employee shall then be permitted to make an opening statement; 
c.  The appointing power shall produce evidence; the appointing power shall have the burden of proof and burden of producing evidence showing by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of facts which support the imposition of the discipline; and 
d.  The employee may then open his or her defense and offer his or her evidence in support thereof; the employee bears the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence for any affirmative defenses asserted; 
e.  The parties may then, in order, respectively offer rebutting evidence only, unless the Hearing Officer for good reason, permits them to offer evidence upon their original case; 
f.  Closing arguments shall be permitted and written briefs may be permitted. The appointing power shall have the right to open the closing arguments followed by the employee. The appointing power then has a right to reply. 
g.  The Hearing Officer shall determine relevancy, weight, and credibility of testimony and evidence. During the examination of a witness, all other witnesses, except the parties, shall be excluded from the hearing unless the Hearing Officer, for good cause, otherwise directs. 
G.  Appeal for Safety Employees. 
1.  There is created an Appeals Commission. The Appeals Commission shall discharge the duties as delegated to it in this section. The Appeals Commission shall consist of a five (5) member board as appointed by the City Council. Subject to the approval of the City Council, each City Councilmember and the Mayor shall nominate one member to serve on the Appeals Commission for a term in office on the Appeals Commission which is no longer than the remaining term of the City Councilmember who has nominated the member of the Appeals Commission. The method for designating the order in which City Councilmembers may nominate persons to serve as members of the Appeals Commission for vacancies which may exist or occur on the Appeals Commission from and after August 1, 1992 shall be as provided in City Ordinance No. 2374. Members of the Appeals Commission shall serve at the pleasure of the City Council. Notwithstanding the expiration date of the term of a particular member of the Appeals Commission, each Commissioner shall continue to serve at the pleasure of the City Council until his or her successor is nominated and appointed. 
2.  The members of the Appeals Commission shall be compensated at the rate of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per meeting; but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month, in performance of their duties. 
3.  If a vacancy shall occur on the Appeals Commission otherwise than by expiration of a term, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of such term by the nomination of the City Councilmember or Mayor, who originally nominated such member, subject to the approval of the City Council. 
4.  The members of the Appeals Commission shall be qualified electors of said city. No person shall be appointed to said Board who holds any salaried public office or employment; nor shall any member, while a member of the Board or for a period of one year after he or she has ceased for any reason to be a member, be eligible for appointment to any salaried employment in the service of the city other than a city elective office. 
5.  The Appeals Commission shall meet from time-to-time at the request of the Human Resources Officer. Three (3) members of the Appeals Commission shall meet for the purpose of discharging the duties of the Appeals Commission to consider such a matter as referred to it by the Human Resources Officer and two (2) members shall be considered a quorum for the purpose of conducting business. The three (3) members of the Appeals Commission shall be designated lot as drawn by the Human Resources Officer from time to time as may be necessary to consider a particular matter of business. Not less frequently than once per year, the Appeals Commission shall conduct a meeting of its entire membership for the purpose of reviewing the administrative procedures of the Appeals Commission for considering the matters as may be referred to the Appeals Commission under this chapter. At such a meeting where all five (5) members of the Appeals Commission may be present, the Appeals Commission shall not consider any matter as may be referred to the Appeals Commission under this section. 
6.  Any safety employee in the competitive service, who has been demoted, dismissed or reduced in pay, shall be entitled to receive a written statement of the reasons for such action within three (3) days, and he or she shall have three (3) days' time thereafter within which to answer in writing thereto. A copy of such charges and answer shall be filed with the Personnel Clerk. In the event the employee files an answer, a copy of such written charges and of such answer shall be transmitted by the Personnel Clerk to the Appeals Commission. Within ten (10) days from the date of filing his or her answer to the written charges, or in the event such written charges have not been made available to him or her within the time prescribed, then within ten (10) days after the action taken to demote, dismiss or reduce the pay of the employee, he or she may file a written demand with the Personnel Clerk requesting a hearing before the Appeals Commission. The Board shall then investigate the case and conduct a hearing as provided by this chapter and by the rules. 
7.  Reductions in pay which are part of a general plan to reduce salaries and wages as an economy measure or as part of a general curtailment program shall not constitute reductions in pay entitling employees to a hearing under the provisions of this section or of this chapter. 
8.  Any safety employee in the competitive service shall have the right to appeal to the Appeals Commission relative to any situation affecting his employment status or conditions of employment, except in instances where the right of appeal is prohibited by this chapter. Thereupon the Board shall make such investigation as it may deem necessary and within twenty (20) days after the request for hearing was filed by the employee, the Board shall hold a hearing, at which time it shall hear evidence for and against such employee. Hearings may be informally conducted and the rules of evidence need not apply. 
9.  Within ten (10) days after concluding the hearing, the Appeals Commission shall certify its findings and recommendations to the Council or other official from whose action the appeal was taken.

Title 3 - REVENUE AND FINANCE 
Chapters:  
Chapter 3.01 - SEWER SERVICE CHARGE 
Sections: 
 
3.01.010 - Establishment of sewer service charge. 
A.  The record owner of any real property parcel which is connected with and discharges sewage into the city's sewer system, shall pay a sewer service charge to the city. All record owners of real property parcels connecting to the city's sewer system shall be charged for such service in accordance with the use classifications, strength factors and rates set forth by City Council ordinance. As set forth in greater detail under Section 3.01.100, proceeds of the sewer service charge are intended to fund the operations, maintenance and capital costs associated with the city's sewer system. This sewer service charge shall remain in effect until repealed or modified by ordinance of the City Council. 
B.  Except as otherwise permitted under Section 3.01.020, below, the sewer service charge use classifications, strength factors and corresponding rates may be established, adjusted and/or amended from time to time by way of an uncodified City Council ordinance provided any such action is undertaken in compliance with applicable provisions of Article XIIID, Section 6 of the California Constitution and Health and Safety Code Section 5470 et seq., as the same may be amended or renumbered from time to time. The uncodified City Council ordinance setting forth the most recent schedule of use classifications, strength factors and corresponding rates shall be maintained by the City Clerk, the El Monte Finance Division and the El Monte Engineering Division as public records available for viewing and inspection. 
C.  The record owner of any real property parcel for which the sewer service charge has been imposed shall be responsible for payment of the sewer service charge. Any agreement to the contrary between a property owner and a third party, including a tenant, will not relieve the property owner of the responsibility to pay the sewer service charge. 
(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.020 - Calculation of sewer service chargeChanges in use classification. 
A.  The amount of the annual sewer service charge levied upon each real property parcel shall be based on flow and strength methodology patterned after the methodology used by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County which estimates the hydraulic loading and strength characteristics among varying classes of sewer system users. So that the established sewer service charge rates may keep up with inflation, the uncodified City Council ordinance setting such rates may provide for the annual increase of the rates at the beginning of each fiscal year; provided that any such annual inflationary increases may not exceed amounts equal to the lesser of the following: four (4) percent; or the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all items for the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County area over the course of the preceding fiscal year. No such annual inflationary increases may be imposed without first holding a noticed public hearing on the matter and any increases in excess of the amounts authorized under this section shall require the conduct of a majority protest public hearing in compliance with Article XIIID, Section 6 of the California Constitution. 
B.  Whenever the land use classification of a real property parcel connected with the city's sewer system is changed, the rate of the sewer service charge imposed upon the parcel shall be adjusted in the following fiscal year and imposed in accordance with the rate of the sewer service charge then in effect for the new use classification. 
C.  Whenever a real property parcel connected with the city sewer system is lawfully divided into two (2) or more separate real property parcels, each resulting real property parcel that is connected with the city sewer system shall be subject to the sewer service charge set forth under this chapter in accordance with the rate applied to the resulting land use classification associated with each resulting real property parcel. Any adjusted sewer service charge imposed upon the resulting real property parcels shall be adjusted in the following fiscal year and imposed in accordance with the rate of the sewer service charge then in effect for use classification of each new real property parcel. 
D.  Whenever two (2) or more real property parcels are lawfully merged to form a single real property parcel connected with the city sewer system, the resulting real property parcel shall be subject to the sewer service charge set forth under this chapter in accordance with the rate applied to the resulting land use classification associated with new real property parcel. Any adjusted sewer service charge imposed upon the resulting real property parcel shall be adjusted in the following fiscal year and imposed in accordance with the rate of the sewer service charge then in effect for use classification of the new real property parcel. 
E.  If a real property parcel connects to the city's sewer system without payment of a sewer service charge, the Director is authorized to require back charges in the event that the real property parcel has been discharging into the city sewer system. The back charges may be imposed for up to four (4) years in arrears. 
(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.030 - Collection on tax roll. 
The city elects to have sewer service charges for each fiscal year collected on the Los Angeles County tax roll in the same manner, by the same persons, and at the same time as, together with and not separately from, the ad valorem property tax. Except as provided for in Section 5473.8 of the California Health and Safety Code, the sewer service charge shall constitute a lien against each real property parcel with respect to which it has been charged. 
(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.040 - Remedies for collection and enforcement of charges. 
The remedies for collecting and enforcing the sewer service charge set forth in this chapter shall be cumulative and may be pursued alternatively, or any thereof may be used consecutively when the City Council so determines. If any one of such remedies is, or may be, invalid, all valid remedies shall remain effectual. The costs of collection and of the enforcement of the remedies for the collection of sewer charges may be from the revenues from such charges. Any holder of any bond outstanding at any time, which bond is payable from sewer charge revenues, may compel the use of any or all of the remedies provided in this chapter. The holder of any bond payable from the sewer service charge revenues, by mandamus, may compel the City Council to increase the sewer charges to the extent which will make them sufficient to provide enough moneys for the payment of the bonds. 
(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.050 - Compensation of county. 
Consistent with subsection (B)(1) of Section 3.01.100, the Assessor, Auditor-Controller, Tax Collector and/or other subdivision of the County of Los Angeles may be compensated for services rendered on behalf of the city in connection with the levy, collection and enforcement of the sewer service charge in accordance with an agreement between the city and such entities for the collection of taxes, assessments, or property-related fees or charges for the city. 
(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.060 - Confirmation of chargesWritten report hearing. 
A.  On or before the close of each fiscal year, the Director, shall cause a written report to be prepared and filed with the City Clerk. The written report shall contain a description of each real property parcel subject to the sewer service charge and the total sewer service charge sum to be levied upon the parcel for the upcoming fiscal year. The total annual sewer service charge sum levied upon each parcel shall be computed in conformity with the methodology and rates set forth by the uncodified City Council ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 3.01.020. The written report shall also contain all such information as may be required under Section 5473 of the California Health and Safety Code. 
B.  The City Clerk shall give notice of the filing of the written report pursuant to Section 5473.1 of the California Health and Safety Code and shall also give notice of the time and place for a public hearing before the City Council with respect to the written report. Such public hearing shall be set no later than the first Tuesday in July of each year. If the public hearing is continued, such hearing shall be completed no later than the fifteenth day of July so as to provide sufficient time to format and forward all information and data to the appropriate county collection entities for timely placement on the upcoming property tax bill. The foregoing notwithstanding, the failure of the City Council to meet any of the internal deadlines set forth under this subsection shall not preclude the City Council from having the charge authorized under this chapter placed on the annual tax bill so long as the county deadlines for submitting all information and data can still be met. 
C.  At the time and place set forth in the City Clerk's notice of public hearing, the City Council shall hear and consider all objections or protests, if any, to the written report. If the City Council finds that protest is made by the owners of a majority of the real property parcels described in the report, then the report shall not be adopted and the charges shall be collected separately from the tax roll and not constitute a lien against any real property parcel. 
D.  Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council may adopt, revise, change, reduce or modify any charge or overrule any or all obligations and shall make its determination upon each charge as described in the written report. The determination of the City Council shall be final. 
E.  No later than the tenth day of August of each year, the City Clerk, as set forth under Section 5473.4 of the California Health and Safety Code, shall file with the Director a copy of the written report approved by the City Council. The City Clerk shall endorse upon the report a statement over the City Clerk's signature that the report has been finally adopted by the City Council. No later than the tenth day of August of each year, the Director in cooperating with the Deputy City Manager for Administrative Services shall ensure that all information and data approved by the City Council pursuant to this section is forwarded to the appropriate county collecting agencies for timely placement on the annual property tax bills.

(Ord. 2723 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.01.090 - Reconsideration and appeal. 
A.  The procedures of this section shall be available to: (1) the record owner(s) of a real property parcel that is not connected to, or is temporarily disconnected from, the city sewer system, provided such nonconnection or disconnection occurred lawfully or is otherwise permitted under the El Monte Municipal Code or the laws of the state of California; (2) the record owner(s) of a real property parcel who contend(s) that an incorrect use classification or strength factor has been applied to the real property parcel in calculating the amount of the sewer service charge due for a given fiscal year; (3) the record owner(s) of any real property parcel who dispute(s) the basis for the denial of any discount or exemption afforded under Sections 3.01.070 and/or 3.01.080, excluding denials based on the late submission of a discount application; and (4) the record owner(s) of a real property parcel who for any other reason contend(s) the amount determined and charged upon the real property parcel pursuant to Section 3.01.060 (Confirmation of chargesWritten report hearing) is incorrect or has been erroneously or illegally collected. 
B.  Following the City Clerk's issuance of notice of the written report referenced under Section 3.01.060(B) but no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing referenced under Section 3.01.060(B) and (C), the record owner(s) of a real property parcel may submit to the City Clerk an application requesting the reconsideration of any calculation or determination reflected in the written report which relates to any of the matters enumerated under subsection A of this section, above. Any reconsideration request submitted after the time period set forth under this subsection shall be treated as an appeal and shall be subject to the appeal provisions of subsection C of this section. The Director may require that reconsideration requests be made in a specific format (or on a specific form) and the Director may further request that additional supporting documentation and/or data be provided by the applicant. Upon receiving an application pursuant to this subsection, the Director shall conduct an investigation. Based on the Director's examination of the application, any documentation and data submitted by the applicant and such other additional evidence as the Director may obtain, the Director shall render a decision which either affirms or amends the prior calculation or determination. Any such amendment to a prior calculation or determination shall be reflected as an amendment to the written report submitted for City Council approval at the conclusion of the public hearing called for under Section 3.01.060. The record owner(s) of a real property parcel may appeal the Director's decision as to a reconsideration request pursuant to the procedures set forth under subsection C of this section, below. 
C.  Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the proceeds of the charges established under this chapter 3.01, including all interest accrued thereupon (the "sewer charge proceeds") may not be used to pay costs and expenses entirely unrelated to the operation, maintenance or capital costs of the city's sewer system. The foregoing notwithstanding, sewer charge proceeds may be used to reimburse the city's general fund or other special funds of the city for the payment of indirect costs that benefit and are therefore properly allocable to the city sewer system. The total aggregate sum of sewer charge proceeds that may be used to reimburse the city's general fund or any special fund for the payment of indirect costs during any one fiscal year may not exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total sewer charge proceeds collected by the city during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the reimbursement to the general fund and/or special fund is made. For purposes of this chapter, the term "indirect costs" means those costs and expenses charged against the general fund or any other special fund of the city that are not readily identifiable with the operation, maintenance or construction functions of the sewer enterprise but are necessary for the general operation of the sewer enterprise and the conduct of the activities it performs. For purposes of illustration, "indirect costs" may include the cost of insurance coverage that extends to sewer enterprise facilities, equipment and personnel, human resources administration for personnel who serve the sewer enterprise, financial management, accounting, procurement, payroll, treasury, legal services, city management and other general and administrative costs which benefit the sewer enterprise. The sewer charge proceeds may not be loaned to the city's general fund or any other special fund of the city wherein such inter-fund loan is not repaid in full to the sewer fund within the same fiscal year in which the inter-fund loan was originally made. 
D.  Any refund an applicant may be entitled to shall be returned to the applicant as a cash refund. The payment of such cash refunds by the city shall not relieve the record owner(s) of the obligation to remit any unpaid sums stated on the record owner(s) property tax bill. Refunds are intended to reimburse a record owner for overpaid sewer service charge sums that have already been paid by the record owner for the fiscal year in question; or to offset the out-of-pocket cost to the record owner for the pending payment of an unpaid or partially paid property tax bill that includes sewer service charges sums that are in excess of the sums later determined to be appropriate by the hearing officer.

C.  Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the proceeds of the charges established under this Chapter 3.01, including all interest accrued thereupon (the "sewer charge proceeds") may not be used to pay costs and expenses entirely unrelated to the operation, maintenance or capital costs of the city's sewer system. The foregoing notwithstanding, sewer charge proceeds may be used to reimburse the city's general fund or other special funds of the city for the payment of indirect costs that benefit and are therefore properly allocable to the city sewer system. The total aggregate sum of sewer charge proceeds that may be used to reimburse the city's general fund or any special fund for the payment of indirect costs during any one fiscal year may not exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the total sewer charge proceeds collected by the city during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the reimbursement to the general fund and/or special fund is made. For purposes of this chapter, the term "indirect costs" means those costs and expenses charged against the general fund or any other special fund of the city that are not readily identifiable with the operation, maintenance or construction functions of the sewer enterprise but are necessary for the general operation of the sewer enterprise and the conduct of the activities it performs. For purposes of illustration, "indirect costs" may include the cost of insurance coverage that extends to sewer enterprise facilities, equipment and personnel, human resources administration for personnel who serve the sewer enterprise, financial management, accounting, procurement, payroll, treasury, legal services, city management and other general and administrative costs which benefit the sewer enterprise. The sewer charge proceeds may not be loaned to the city's general fund or any other special fund of the city wherein such inter-fund loan is not repaid in full to the sewer fund within the same fiscal year in which the inter-fund loan was originally made.

Within sixty (60) calendar days following July 1, 2025, the City Council shall form an ad hoc Sewer Fund Oversight Committee (hereinafter, the "Committee") tasked with studying the operations, maintenance and capital replacement needs for the city sewer system. Within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of its formation, the Committee shall conduct its first meeting and shall thereafter meet as frequently as the Committee and/or the City Council deem necessary or desirable. Within one year from the date of its first meeting, the ad hoc committee shall develop and prepare a written report to the City Council which evaluates both the short-term and long-term operations, maintenance and capital replacement needs of the city sewer system; and makes recommendations as to potential adjustments to the sewer service charges rates then in existence. Upon the receipt of the written report, the City Council shall have one year to decide whether or not to adjust the sewer service charge rates in accordance with all or some of the recommendations set forth in the written report of the Sewer Fund Oversight Committee; and shall evidence such determination by uncodified City Council ordinance. If the City Council elects to adjust the sewer service charge rates, the City Council shall comply with all such procedures as may be required for such adjustment including those procedures set forth under Article XIIID, Section of the California Constitution. Nothing in this section shall prevent the City Council from forming such other ad hoc committees as may be desirable to study and make recommendations as to the operations, maintenance and capital replacement need of the city sewer system.

Editor's note This chapter and the transactions and use tax imposed under this chapter was first enacted by a vote of the people held on November 4, 2008 and was originally approved as Measure GG.

3.14.030 - Purpose. 
This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes: 
A.  To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose. 
B.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
C.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes. 
D.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2725 § 1 (part), 2008)  
3.14.040 - Contract with state.

(Ord. 2725 § 1 (part), 2008)

For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. 
(Ord. 2725 § 1 (part), 2008)

Chapter 3.16 - UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
Sections: 
 
3.16.010 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax of the City of El Monte." 
(Prior code § 6600.1)  
3.16.020 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of this chapter certain words and terms are hereafter defined and shall have the meaning thus ascribed: 
"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
"Operator" means a person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
"Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or nor received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
"Tax Administrator" means the City License Officer. 
"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit or right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired. 
(Prior code §§ 6600.26600.7)  
3.16.030 - Imposition and rate. 
Tax imposed for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten (10) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. 
(Prior code § 6601)  
3.16.040 - Exemptions. 
A.  The tax enacted by this chapter shall not be imposed upon any person or agency defined in the following subsections: 
1.  Exempted by Law. Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
2.  Foreign Agencies. Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
B.  Procedure. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. 
(Prior code §§ 66026602.1, 6602.36602.4)  
3.16.050 - Collection procedureOperator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Prior code § 6603)  
3.16.060 - Registration. 
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from him or her a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Prior code § 6603.1)  
3.16.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
The Tax Administrator shall prepare and revise from time-to-time one or more tax reporting forms to be completed by operators and submitted to the city together with each remittance of the tax imposed by this chapter. The tax as imposed by this chapter shall be remitted to the city in monthly installments unless a shorter remittance period is ordered by the Tax Administrator. On or before the last day of the month following the close of the reporting month, each operator shall transmit to the Tax Administrator the tax as impounded under this chapter during the preceding or reporting month, together with such completed forms which identify the total rents charged and received by the operator. A completed form shall include a statement by the operator which identities and describes the posted room rates, as such term is defined by the Civil Code Section 1863, which were applicable during the reporting period. At the time the completed form is submitted to the Tax Administrator, the full amount of the tax collected shall also be remitted to the Tax Administrator. Returns and tax payments are due immediately upon cessation of business by an operator for any reason. All taxes collected by operators under this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any operator, provided the Tax Administrator has first determined that a shorter reporting period is necessary or appropriate in order to insure prompt remittance of the tax and/or submission of accurate tax reporting information. In particular cases, the Tax Administrator may determine that the submission of supplemental accounting, rent cash receipt, transient occupancy tax trust account deposit records, occupancy reports, and other operator business records are necessary or appropriate in connection with the submission of a report (or series of reports) by an operator. 
(Ord. 2497 § 1, 1999: Ord. 2496 § 1, 1999: prior code § 6603.2)  
3.16.080 - Penalties and interest. 
Penalties shall apply and interest be due as provided in the following subsections: 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provision of this chapter shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Prior code §§ 6603.36603.3.5)  
3.16.090 - Tax administrator determinations. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.16.100. 
(Prior code § 6603.4)  
3.16.100 - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 6603.4.1)  
3.16.110 - Records. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Prior code § 6603.5)  
3.16.120 - Refunds. 
Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in the following subsections provided a claim in writing therefor stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator. 
(Prior code § 6603.6)  
3.16.130 - Credits. 
An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected as not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(Prior code § 6603.6.1)  
3.16.140 - Claims. 
A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in Section 3.16.120, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(Prior code § 6603.6.2)  
3.16.150 - Proof. 
No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this chapter unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Prior code § 6603.6.3)  
3.16.160 - Action to collect. 
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Prior code § 6603.7)  
3.16.170 - Audits. 
The city may, for good cause, conduct an audit of the books and records of a motel. If there is substantial deviation in the amount of taxes as a result of the audit, the cost of the audit is to be borne by the operator together with the imposition of appropriate penalties. 
(Added during 1999 recodification)

A.  No tax (or any portion of such a tax as specified in this section) which is approved, imposed and levied by the city pursuant to this chapter shall apply to: 
1.  Charges imposed by the service supplier relating to late payments by the service user, returned check fees and other late collection penalties, interest charges and the like of the service supplier; 
2.  The city and other public agencies; 
3.  Any person or service user in the event that the imposition of such tax upon that person or service user would be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California; 
4.  Any individual residential service user who resides in the city who is at least sixty-two (62) years of age or older, provided the combined adjusted gross income as used for federal income tax reporting purposes of all members of the household does not exceed the limits for "very low family income" set by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in its document entitled "Revised Income Limits for Public Housing and Section 8 programs and Medium Family Incomes" for Los Angeles County;

7.  Notwithstanding any provision of Section 3.20.080 to the contrary, no service user shall pay the tax imposed by Section 3.20.080 on "multichannel video programming distributor services," as this term is defined in 47 United States Code Section 522(12), which are provided to the service user by a multichannel video programming distributor which holds a "franchise," as this term is defined in 47 United States Code Section 522(9), which has been initially authorized by the city pursuant to Section 7630, et seq., of this code; and 
8.  The city may hereafter establish other classifications of persons or services which may be declared to be exempt, in whole or in part, from the levy, payment and collection of any tax which is otherwise imposed by this chapter. Such other classifications shall be described by resolution of the City Council and the resolution shall also contain a description of the duration of the exemption and any special tax administrating eligibility verifications and other procedures applicable to the granting of the exemption authorized by resolution of the City Council pursuant to this subsection (A)(8). 
B.  The exemptions authorized by subsections (A)(3)(8) of this section shall not relieve the service supplier from the duty to collect the applicable tax amount from any service user who may be eligible to claim such an exemption or relieve any service user from the duty and liability to pay the applicable tax amount to the service supplier, unless an exemption has been applied for by the service user and granted by the Tax Collector in accordance with the provisions of this section. Any service user exempt from the payment of any of the taxes imposed by this chapter because of the provisions of subsections (A)(2)(3) of this section may file an application with the Tax Collector for approval of an exemption. Such an application shall be submitted by the service user/applicant upon a form supplied by the Tax Collector and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption. 
C.  The Tax Collector shall review all such applications and shall certify as exempt those applicants determined to be qualified hereunder. The Tax Collector shall notify all service suppliers affected that such exemptions have been approved. Upon the receipt of such notice, the service supplier shall not be required to continue to bill any further tax imposed by this chapter on such exempt service user until further notice by the Tax Collector is given. The service supplier shall eliminate such exempt service user from its tax billing procedure no later than sixty (60) days after the receipt of such notice from the Tax Collector. 
D.  All exemptions authorized under this section shall continue for so long as the prerequisite facts supporting the initial eligibility for exemption shall continue; provided, however, the exemption shall automatically terminate upon the earlier date of any change in the service address (or residence in the case of an individual), assignment of a different customer account number by the service supplier or by virtue of a discontinuance, suspension, termination of service to the person who has otherwise been found to be eligible for such an exemption; provided however, that such individual may nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each change of address or residence in the city. 
E.  The Tax Collector shall have the power and right to demand evidence of the continued eligibility of a service user for an exemption under the provisions of subsections (A)(3)(8) of this section. Such evidence may include, but need not be limited to, copies of business records, letters, statements from public agencies such as the Social Security Administration, copies of income tax returns, and such other evidence concerning the service user or other members of this household which may tend to prove or disapprove such eligibility. The failure of a service user to provide such evidence within thirty (30) days following a written by the Tax Collector, shall be grounds for the cancellation of service user's eligibility for exemption under the provisions of this section, effective ten (10) days following the date of mailing of a notice of cancellation by the Tax Collector. 
F.  Any person or service user who has been confirmed to be exempt from payment of any amount of tax(es) approved in this chapter, pursuant to this section, shall notify the Tax Collector within ten (10) days of any change in the facts or circumstances which might disqualify such person or service user from further eligibility to either claim or maintain such an exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of an exemption authorized by this section when the basis for such exemption either does not exist or ceases to exist. 
G.  If the Tax Collector determines that an application for exemption is incomplete, or that the applicant has failed to truthfully set forth facts in support of the claim for exemption or if the applicant is not eligible for an exemption, then in such event, the application for the exemption shall be denied in a written notice mailed to the applicant. The applicant shall thereafter have a right to file an amended application for an exemption or to appeal the Tax Collector's decision to the City Administrator within ten (10) days after the date of mailing of the Tax Collector's notice of denial. In the case of an appeal, the City Administrator shall review the facts in consultation with the City Attorney and the City Administrator shall render a final written determination on such appeal. 
H.  The Tax Collector shall annually prepare a list of the service users who have submitted applications and been found to be exempt by the Tax Collector under the provisions of subsections (A)(3)(8) of this section, and furnish a copy thereof to each service supplier. The list shall contain the name of the service user, together with the current address to which such is supplied. 
I.  The Tax Collector shall adopt and thereafter may modify from time to time as appropriate, additional written procedure for the administration of this section, as provided in Section 3.20.170. 
(Ord. 2695 § 2 (part), 2007; prior code § 6270.4)  
3.20.051 - Alternative tax payment option. 
A.  Any person or service user subject to any tax imposed under this chapter and/or Chapter 3.22 (Communication Users' Tax) may opt to pay a fixed tax sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) per calendar year. This fixed tax sum shall be paid in lieu of any actual, aggregate tax sums which would otherwise be collected on behalf of the city by a service supplier in amounts that would otherwise be due pursuant to this chapter and/or Chapter 3.22 during any given calendar year. The fixed tax sum shall be paid directly to the city by the person or service user in bi-annual increments of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) which shall be due and payable on or before the close of business on January 1st and July 1st of each calendar year. If January 1st or July 1st falls on a date in which the city is closed for business, the applicable deadline shall be extended to the close of business on the next business day in which the city is open for business. 
B.  In order to qualify for the tax payment alternative set forth under this section, a prospective applicant must submit, under penalty of perjury, true and correct documentation (e.g., utility bills and other like documentation) demonstrating to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that over the twelve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding the submission of the application, the aggregate amount of taxes collected from, or otherwise paid by, the applicant pursuant to this chapter and/or Chapter 3.22 exceeded the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00). 
C.  If approved by the Tax Administrator, participation under the alternative payment procedures set forth under this section shall become effective upon January 1st or July 1st, which ever date most immediately follows the date upon which the application was approved; the first incremental payment of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) shall be due and payable at this time. Consistent with subsection A of this section, above, incremental payments of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) shall be due and payable to the city on January 1st and July 1st of each calendar year until such time as the applicant opts out of or the applicant's participation is terminated, all in accordance with subsections D and E of this section, below. 
D.  An applicant may opt out of the alternative payment procedures afforded under this section at any time, provided such request is submitted to the Tax Administrator in writing; thereafter, the applicant shall be taxed, and such tax collected, in the manner otherwise provided under this chapter and/or Chapter 3.22 effective January 1st or July 1st whichever date most immediately follows the date upon which the Tax Administrator receives the written request to opt out of the alternative payment procedures set forth under this section. 
E.  Notwithstanding, any other provisions set forth under this chapter or Chapter 3.22 relating to the disposition of delinquencies and/or the imposition of collection penalties, the Tax Administrator may unilaterally terminate an applicant's participation under the alternative payment procedures set forth herein in the event the applicant fails to timely pay any or all sums due under this section. Such termination shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date the Tax Administrator issues written notice of any delinquency to the delinquent applicant, unless all delinquent sums owed are actually received by the city prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day grace period. In the event of termination, a terminated applicant shall be barred from reapplying under this section for a period of one year. Upon the effective date of the termination, the applicant shall be taxed, and such tax collected, in the manner otherwise provided under this chapter and/or Chapter 3.22. 
F.  The terms "person," "service user" and "service supplier" as used in this section include all persons, service users and service suppliers within the meaning of this chapter and within the meaning of Chapter 3.22. For purposes of this section, the terms "person," "service user," and "service supplier" shall be construed to have the broader, more encompassing meaning in the event of any conflict or inconsistency as between the meanings set forth under this chapter and the meanings set forth under Chapter 3.22.

The cogenerated electricity service user shall pay the tax approved by this section to the Tax Collector in the manner provided in Section 3.20.110C. 
1.  If the cogenerator sells the energy for consumption by other service users in the city, the value of the cogenerated electricity sold to each such service user in the city shall be based upon the actual charges made for such service, and the amount of the tax approved by this section shall be collected from the service user by the cogenerator/nonutility supplier. The cogenerator shall install and maintain an appropriate metering system for meaning the number of kilovolts of cogenerated electricity provided to the service user such that the cogenerator and the Tax Collector may verify compliance with the obligation of the service user to pay the tax amount approved by this subsection F.

A.  The tax shall be collected by the service supplier insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the charges made in accordance with the regular service billing practice of the service supplier. In the event that any amount paid by a service user to a service supplier includes less than the full amount of the charge and tax imposed by this chapter which accrued during the billing period, such an amount and any subsequent payments by a service user shall be applied to the utility service charges: first (or net of the amount of the tax imposed under this chapter) until such other charges of the service supplier have been fully satisfied; and second, any remaining balance shall be applied to the tax amount due from service user under this chapter. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of a refusal to pay a tax amount approved by this chapter, Section 3.20.140E shall apply. 
B.  The duty of the service supplier to collect the tax approved by this chapter from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a service user receives more than one billing from the service supplier relating to one or more billing periods or relating to one or more separate service accounts, the duty of the service supplier to collect the amount of the tax approved by this chapter from the service user shall arise separately for each billing period and/or for each separate account payable by that service user. 
C.  Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Section 3.20.090 or Section 3.20.100 hereof, which produces electricity or gas for self-use, as applicable, or any service user who purchases gas or electricity directly from a nonutility supplier which does not collect the applicable tax amount approved and levied by this chapter from the service user, or any such service user who does not otherwise pay the full tax due for the use of such gas or electricity (as applicable), shall report said fact to the Tax Collector and shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Collector within thirty (30) days of use of such gas or electricity. In lieu of paying the actual amount of any of the taxes referenced in the first sentence of this section, the service user may, at its option, remit to the Tax Collector within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of the tax payable based upon an average monthly estimated payment pattern for use of comparable amounts of gas or electricity (as applicable), provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, to the Tax Collector within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter. A credit, if approved by the Tax Collector, may he applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. The Tax Collector may require the service user to identify its nonutility supplier and provide, subject to audit, invoices, books of account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used and the cost of price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide satisfactory evidence relating to the calculation of the tax, or, if the Tax Collector may determine the amount of the tax payable by applying the tax rate to the equivalent service charges which the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used had been provided by a gas corporation or electrical corporation, as applicable, which is a primary provider of gas or electricity within the city. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be prepared by the Tax Collector. 
D.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the city from directly billing any service user or directly collecting from any service user the amount of any tax approved by this chapter in accordance with such direct tax billing and/or direct tax collection procedure as may be provided by rule or regulation of the Tax Collector approved by resolution of the City Council.

A notice of the assessment shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes and penalties imposed and the time and place when such assessment shall be submitted to the City Council for confirmation or modification. The City Clerk shall mail a copy of such notice to the service supplier and to the service user at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing and shall post such notice for at least five (5) continuous days prior to the date of the hearing. Any interested party having any objections may appear and be heard at the hearing provided his objection is filed in writing with the City Clerk prior to the time act for the hearing. At the time fixed for considering such assessment, the City Council shall hear the same, together with any objections filed as provided in this subsection, and thereupon may confirm or modify such assessment by motion.

A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the city, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter within the city or distributed from a location within the city; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail. 
B.  The city shall make available, upon request, an accurate description of its jurisdictional boundaries based on street addresses and/or ZIP Plus Four, in an electronic format. If a service supplier relies upon such information provided by city, it shall not be responsible for any errors in taxation that may result. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.080 - Duty to collectProcedures. 
A.  Collection by Service Suppliers. The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be performed as follows: 
1.  The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 3.22.120 shall apply. 
2.  The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a service user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. 
B.  Filing Return and Payment. Each person required by this chapter to remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.090 - Collection penaltiesService suppliers. 
A.  Taxes collected from a service user are delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging moneys between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this section shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the city's account on the following business day. 
B.  If the person required to collect and/or remit the communication users' tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one or more services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax collected on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid. 
C.  The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator. 
D.  For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
E.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of this chapter to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other public agencies imposing a communication users' tax, or otherwise legally established, to create a central payment location or mechanism. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.100 - Actions to collect. 
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person's noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C). 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.110 - Deficiency determination and assessmentTax application errors. 
A.  The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any service user or service supplier required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section 3.22.110 if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit. 
B.  The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person or entity allegedly owing the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person or entity allegedly owing the tax may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter. 
C.  If the person or entity allegedly owing the tax fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city. If the person or entity allegedly owing the tax requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person or entity at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person or entity to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced. 
D.  At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to the person or entity owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3.22.160 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 3.22.160 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon. Both the Tax Administrator and the City Manager may designate an independent Hearing Officer to conduct any of the hearings or other proceedings contemplated under this section and such Hearing Officer shall render a decision in the manner provided herein. 
E.  Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen (15) percent on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax assessed under this chapter shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection. 
F.  All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.120 - Administrative remedy-Nonpaying service users. 
A.  Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain name service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section 3.22.120 if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit. 
B.  In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen (15) percent of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid. 
C.  The Tax Administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address. 
D.  If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen (15) percent of the amount of the total tax that is owed. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.130 - Additional powers and duties of the Tax Administrator. 
A.  The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. 
C.  Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the city at any time. 
D.  The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 3.22.110 of this chapter for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness. 
E.  Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of seventy-five hundredths (0.75) percent per month, prorated for any portion thereof. 
F.  The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter. 
G.  Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the noncollection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the noncollection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedence. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.140 - Records. 
A.  It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time. 
B.  The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to conduct the inspection. 
C.  The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a nondisclosure agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. 
D.  If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and (2) upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city. 
E.  If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on such person for each day following: (1) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or (2) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.150 - Refunds. 
Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a person or service supplier, it may be refunded as provided in this section: 
A.  The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a service user or service supplier, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor, or administrator has submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided by this section. 
B.  The filing of a written claim pursuant to Government Code Section 935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the city pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Government Code Sections 945.6 and 946. The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set forth in Government Code Section 912.4. If the Tax Administrator/City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by Government Section 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the City Council on the last day of the period within which the City Council was required to act upon the claim as provided in Government Code Section 912.4. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913. 
C.  Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection A of this section, the Tax Administrator may, at his or her discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected and remitted any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter, to claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the city upon a subsequent monthly return(s) to the Tax Administrator, provided that: (1) such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous collection of said tax; (2) the Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and amount of such credit has been reasonably established; and (3) in the case of an overpayment by a service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to the city, the Tax Administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier to the service user in an amount equal to the requested credit. 
D.  Notwithstanding subsections A through C of this section, above, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the city within the three (3) years next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment by the Tax Administrator in connection with an audit instituted by the Tax Administrator pursuant to Section 3.22.130(D). A service supplier shall not be entitled to said credit unless it clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an underpayment pursuant to this section qualify a service supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the one-year written claim requirement of this section. 
(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.160 - Appeals.

Any person aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.22.150 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this section. Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (See Government Code Section 935(b)). Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim or action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. 
B.  If any person is aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.22.150 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator; he or she may appeal to the City Manager by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days of the date of the decision, deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator which aggrieved the service user or service supplier. 
C.  The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before an independent Hearing Officer selected by the City Manager, no more than forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the appeal.

At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the Tax Administrator, and any other interested person may present such relevant evidence as he or she may have relating to the determination from which the appeal is taken. 
D.  Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the city's files, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision.

(Ord. 2695 § 1 (part), 2007)  
3.22.200 - No increase in tax percentage or change in methodology without voter approval. 
A.  Regarding Section 3.22.050, the city may not increase the tax percentage or change a methodology for calculating the tax so as to result in an increase in a tax imposed on a person, without voter approval. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, pursuant to Government Code Section 53750, the city may make the following changes without voter approval: 
1.  Reduce the percentage rate, and at any time thereafter increase such percentage rate, so long as the subsequent increase does not exceed the rate previously approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter; 
2.  Change the methodology so as to reduce the amount of the tax being levied, and at any time thereafter change the methodology, so long as the subsequent change in methodology does not result in an increase in the amount being levied under the methodology previously approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter; 
3.  Change a methodology or definition so as to avoid or eliminate a discriminatory tax on taxpayers that are similarly situated, so long as the change does not result in an increase in the amount levied on such class of similarly situated taxpayers under the methodology or definition previously approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter; 
4.  Establish a class of persons that is exempt or excepted from one or more taxes hereunder, and at any time thereafter, discontinue such exemption or exception; 
5.  Decide that all or a part of a tax imposed under Section 3.22.050 should not be enforced for administrative reasons, and at any time thereafter, decide to enforce the full amount of such tax as previously approved by the voters in the enactment of this chapter; or 
6.  Establish, and at any time thereafter change, the value and/or apportionment (including a "safe harbor" percentage) of taxable and nontaxable services that are bundled or packaged under a combined charge, in response to changes in the marketing of combined services and the components thereof, or in reevaluating the values thereof (See Section 3.22.060).

The intent of this section is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during the transition period from the prior telephone and video users' tax to the new communication users' tax (which transition period ends April 1, 2008) and to permit communications service providers, during that transition period to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax. 
B.  Collection of Tax by Service Providers. Service providers shall begin to collect the tax imposed by this chapter as soon as feasible after the effective date of the chapter, but in no event later than permitted by Section 799 of the California Public Utilities Code.

The business establishment shall be required to notify the Director and the Permit Committee in writing within seven (7) calendar days of the date any of the information required under this subsection (A)(l) of this Section changes. 
2.  Cart Inventory; Compliance with Mandatory Cart Signage Requirements. The cart containment plan shall include a complete inventory of all carts located on the premises whether owned by, furnished to, or otherwise used by the business establishment in its operations. Each such cart shall be identified by serial number of such other numbering system as may be employed by the business establishment. The cart containment plan shall identify those measures that must be, or have been, undertaken by the business establishment to comply with the mandatory cart signage requirements set forth under Section 8.54.040 (Mandatory Cart Signage) of Chapter 8.54 of this code and shall require that any cart owned by, furnished to, or otherwise used by the business establishment comply with these requirements. If full compliance with the signage requirements is not complete as of the date the containment plan is approved, the plan shall set forth a time frame for full compliance not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days from the date of approval. No later than the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month following the approval of a cart containment plan, the business establishment shall be required to provide the Director and the Permit Committee with an updated inventory list identifying all carts which are no longer in its inventory, all new carts added to its inventory and all carts which remain in its inventory since the last reporting. 
3.  Notice to Customers. The cart containment plan shall require that written notice be provided to customers in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese stating that the unauthorized removal of carts from the premises is prohibited under the laws of the state of California and a violation of this code. Such notice may be provided in the form of flyers distributed on the premises, warnings printed on shopping bags or direct mail. In addition, the business establishment shall be required to place and maintain cart removal warning signs which meet all of the following minimum specifications: (i) meet or exceed eighteen (18) inches in width and twenty-four (24) inches in height; (ii) using block lettering not less than one-half inch in width and two (2) inches in height, contain a statement in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese, warning that the unauthorized removal of carts from the premises, or possession of a cart in a location other than the premises, is a violation of the laws of the state of California and this code; and (iv) be conspicuously affixed to an interior wall of the building in which the business establishment is located or permanently and prominently displayed within two (2) feet of all building entrances and exits. The cart containment plan shall detail the specific means by which the business establishment shall comply with this element. 
4.  Daily Cart Confinement. All carts located on the premises of the business establishment (other than an establishment open for business twenty-four (24) hours per day) shall be collected at the end of each business day by employees of the business establishment and shall be collectively confined in a secure manner at the cart confinement area on the premises as designated in the cart containment plan until the commencement of the next business day. All carts located on the premises of any business establishment open for business twenty-four (24) hours per day, other than carts then currently in use by a customer, shall be collected by employees of the retail establishment and returned to the designated cart confinement area on the premises at least twice per calendar day between the hours of one p.m. and five p.m. and the hours of eight p.m. and one a.m. for each day the business establishment is open for business. The provisions of this element shall not apply to carts which are physically confined within an enclosed building. The cart containment plan shall set forth the means by which the business establishment shall comply with the provisions of this element. 
5.  Retrieval from Immediate Vicinity of Premises. The business establishment shall designate employees in sufficient number to assure that all public streets and sidewalks immediately abutting the outer perimeter of the premises are patrolled no less often than once every six (6) hours. Each cart found as a result of such patrols shall be immediately retrieved by the business establishment so as to prevent it from blocking sidewalks or rolling onto streets. The cart containment plan shall identify the areas to be patrolled as required by this element; the number of personnel designated to undertake such patrols; the manner, frequency and times of such patrols; and the procedures to be employed by the business establishment to identify and retrieve any lost, stolen or abandoned carts. The cart containment plan shall require that the business establishment maintain a daily log indicating the time and frequency of such patrols and the names of the person undertaking such patrols on behalf of the business establishment. Each daily log shall be maintained by the business establishment for a minimum of three (3) years and shall be made available for inspection and copying within forty-eight (48) hours following any oral or written request for inspection and copying by the Director or the Permit Committee. 
6.  Employee Training. The business establishment shall implement and maintain a periodic training program for its new and existing employees designed to educate such employees concerning the requirements of the cart containment plan and the provisions of state law prohibiting the unauthorized removal of carts from the premises of a business establishment. The cart containment plan shall describe the elements of the employee training program. 
7.  Retrieval Personnel. Each business establishment shall provide personnel for purposes of the retrieval of lost, stolen or abandoned carts. Such personnel may be either employees of the business establishment or one or more independent contractors hired by the business establishment to provide cart retrieval services, or a combination of both. The cart containment plan shall either (i) identify the number of employees assigned to cart retrieval duties, the number of total hours per week that each assigned employee will perform such services (in addition to any on-premises retrieval duties to which such employee may be assigned), and the training each such personnel has received or will receive concerning the retrieval of lost, stolen or abandoned carts; or (ii) include a copy of each contract with a cart retrieval service. For purposes of this Section, those identified in the cart containment plan as providing cart retrieval services, shall be referred to in this Section as "retrieval personnel."

Each vehicle used by retrieval personnel shall bear conspicuous signs on the vehicle identifying either the name of the business establishment for which such retrieval service is being performed or, if applicable, the name of the cart retrieval service with which the retail establishment has contracted for such service. The cart containment plan shall set forth the means by which the business establishment shall comply with this element. 
8.  Physical Containment Measures. The cart containment plan shall identify all such physical containment measures installed or otherwise employed by the business establishment in compliance with Chapter 17.06 (General Regulations) of Title 17 (Zoning) of this code. Each business establishment shall maintain all such physical containment systems, devices and/or equipment in good working order. All such physical containment measures must remain in operation at all times. With respect to containment systems involving wheel locking or stopping mechanisms used in conjunction with an electronic or magnetic barrier, such systems may be rendered temporarily inoperable by the business establishment for the limited purpose of undertaking scheduled repairs and/or maintenance, provided that the City is given at least three (3) business days prior written notice of such work and provided such notice also includes the approximate times at which the system shall be rendered inoperable and the estimated time in which all such work shall be completed. All such repairs and maintenance shall be completed within seven (7) calendar days from the estimated date of completion. During any period in which the system is inoperable regardless of the cause, the business establishment shall dispatch employees or security guards to deter or stop customers from removing carts from the premises. 
B.  Compliance Required. Each business establishment subject to this Section shall comply with the terms, conditions and requirements of this Section, its approved cart containment plan and the underlying business permit to which the cart containment plan corresponds.

G.  Use of Shopping Carts Following Revocation Prohibited. No business establishment subject to the requirements of this chapter shall provide or make available carts for use by its customers or otherwise use carts in its operations following the date of any decision revoking a business permit unless and until a new business permit and cart containment plan is approved by the Permit Committee for such business establishment.

Editor's note Ord. No. 2878, § 9, April 5, 2016, repealed former ch. 5.56, §§ 5.56.0105.56.160, and enacted a new ch. 5.56 as set out herein. Former ch. 5.56 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2779, § 2, adopted October 18, 2011. 
 
5.56.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The City Council finds and declares as follows: 
A.  The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, while recognizing massage as a legitimate business interest that provides benefits to its patrons in a therapeutic setting. 
B.  This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the State Constitution, Sections 51030 et seq. of the Government Code, Sections 460, 4600 through 4620 and Section 16000 of the Business and Professions Code, Section 13 of the Chiropractic Act (initiative measure approved by the electors November 7, 1922, as amended), and California Assembly Bill 1147. 
C.  There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by persons improperly trained and/or educated in providing massage services, and this chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss. 
D.  There is opportunity for acts of prostitution, lewdness, and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments, as well as problems relating to human trafficking in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments are often brothels in disguise. The establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity and would thereby benefit the public health. 
E.  The provisions of this chapter are intended to enhance the efficient processing of permits for massage establishments, owners and managers and the ongoing regulation of those permittees and certificate holders by the city. The provisions of this chapter in no way limit the authority of the city to inspect massage establishments or conduct investigations to ensure permittees are complying with applicable rules and regulations. 
F.  The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are intended to stop the practice of massage establishments changing ownership upon the discovery of criminal activity by law enforcement authorities. 
G.  The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are intended to be in addition to, and not in lieu of, (i) the requirement to obtain a valid business license issued pursuant to Chapters 5.04 (Business Licenses General) and 5.08 (Business License Taxes) of Title 5 (Business Licenses and Regulations) of the El Monte Municipal Code; (ii) where applicable, the requirement to separately apply for and secure any discretionary land use approvals required under Title 17 (Zoning) of the El Monte Municipal Code; (iii) the requirement to obtain any and all building permits required under Title 15 (Building and Construction) of the El Monte Municipal Code; (iv) the requirement to obtain any certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy required under Chapter 17.16 (Certificate of Occupancy) of Title 17 (Zoning) of the El Monte Municipal Code; or (v) or any other permit, authorization or approval which may be required under the laws of the United States of America, the State of California, the County of Los Angeles, the El Monte Municipal Code or any other public agency or entity with jurisdiction over the applicants profession or business operations. 
H.  The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are intended to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution, and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved within the confines allowed by state law. 
I.  The provisions of this chapter are not intended to be exclusive and compliance therewith shall not excuse noncompliance with any state or local laws or regulations that are uniformly applied to other professional or personal service businesses. 
J.  The California Massage Therapy Council ("CAMTC") can better, and more efficiently, regulate massage technicians in order to best protect the public and it is in the public interest that all persons providing massage in the city have a certificate from CAMTC.

A.  The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

8.10.020 - Requirements and prohibitions. 
A.  Tobacco Retailer Permit Required. It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer in the city without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer's permit pursuant to this chapter for each location at which that activity is to occur. Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailer's permit is a nuisance as a matter of law. 
B.  Lawful Business Operation. In the course of tobacco retailing or in the operation of the business or maintenance of the location for which a permit issued, it shall be a violation of this chapter for a permittee or any of the permittee's agents or employees, to violate any local, state, or federal law applicable to tobacco products. 
C.  Display of Permit. Each tobacco retailer permit shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the permitted location. 
D.  Positive Identification Required. No person engaged in tobacco retailing shall sell or transfer a tobacco product to another person who appears to be under the age of twenty-seven (27) years without first examining the identification of the recipient to confirm that the recipient is at least the minimum age under state law to purchase and possess the tobacco product. 
E.  Minimum Age for Persons Selling Tobacco. No person who is younger than the minimum age established by state law for the purchase or possession of tobacco products shall engage in tobacco retailing. 
F.  Self-Service Displays Prohibited. Tobacco retailing by means of a self-service display is prohibited. 
G.  False and Misleading Advertising Prohibited. A tobacco retailer or proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer permit, including, for example, a person whose permit has been revoked: 
1.  Shall keep all tobacco products out of public view. The public display of tobacco products in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing without a permit under Section 8.10.120; and 
2.  Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products that promotes the sale or distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer's location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at that location. 
H.  Packaging and Labeling. No tobacco retailer shall sell any tobacco product to any consumer unless such product: (1) is sold in the original manufacturer's packaging intended for sale to consumers; and (2) conforms to all applicable federal labeling requirements.

1.  Any little cigar unless it is sold in a package of at least twenty (20) little cigars.

(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011; Ord. No. 2935, § 3, 9-4-2018)  
8.10.030 - Limits on eligibility for a tobacco retailer permit.

8.10.040 - Application procedure. 
A.  Application for a tobacco retailer's permit shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. 
B.  It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer's permit. No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a permit as a determination by the city that the proprietor has complied with all laws applicable to tobacco retailing. A permit issued contrary to this chapter, contrary to any other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 8.10.110(D) of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to vest in any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's permit any status or right to act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.

1.  The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the business seeking a permit.

3.  A single name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all communications and notices (the "authorized address") required by, authorized by, or convenient to the enforcement of this chapter. If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (C)2 above. 
4.  Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer's permit is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer's permit by the California Board of Equalization.

6.  Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this chapter as specified on the application form required by this section. 
D.  A permitted tobacco retailer shall inform the department in writing of any change in the information submitted on an application for a tobacco retailer's permit within ten (10) business days of a change. 
E.  Permit applications must be submitted prior to January 1 of the calendar year for which the permit will be in effect. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.050 - Issuance of Permit. 
A.  Upon the receipt of a complete application for a tobacco retailer's permit and the permit fee required by this chapter, the department shall issue a permit unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one or more of the following bases for denial exists: 
1.  The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this chapter. 
2.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location for which this chapter prohibits issuance of tobacco retailer permits. However, this subparagraph shall not constitute a basis for denial of a permit if the applicant provides the city with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm's length transaction. 
3.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a proprietor to whom this chapter prohibits a permit to be issued. 
4.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to this chapter, that is unlawful to this Municipal Code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other law. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.060 - Permit renewal and expiration. 
A.  Renewal of Permit. A tobacco retailer's permit is invalid if the appropriate fee has not been timely paid in full or if the term of the permit has expired. The term of a tobacco retailer permit is one year commencing on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the same calendar year. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer's permit and submit the permit fee no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term. 
B.  Expiration of Permit. A tobacco retailer's permit that is not timely renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To renew a permit not timely renewed pursuant to subsection (A), the proprietor must: 
1.  Submit the permit fee and application renewal form; and 
2.  Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor: 
a.  Has not sold and will not sell any tobacco products after the permit expiration date and before the permit is renewed; or 
b.  Has waited the appropriate ineligibility period established for tobacco retailing without a permit, as set forth in Section 8.10.120(A) of this chapter, before seeking renewal of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.070 - Permit Nontransferable. 
A.  A tobacco retailer's permit may not be transferred from one person to another or from one location to another. A new tobacco retailer's permit is required whenever a tobacco retailing location has a change in proprietor(s). 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and permit ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless: 
1.  The location has been fully transferred to a new proprietor or fully transferred to entirely new proprietors; and 
2.  The new proprietor(s) provide the city with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor(s) have acquired or is acquiring the location in an arm's length transaction. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.080 - Permit conveys a limited, conditional privilege. 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's permit any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of, any other provision of applicable law, including but not limited to, any provision of this Municipal Code, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code Section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer permit does not make the retailer a "retail or whole tobacco shop" for the purposes of California Labor Code Section 6404.5. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.090 - Fee for permit. 
By resolution, the city council shall establish and may from time to time adjust a schedule of fees for the issuance of a tobacco retailer's permit under this chapter. Fees shall be calculated so as to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this chapter, including, for example, issuing a permit, administering the permit program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecutions of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the regulatory program authorized by this chapter. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.100 - Compliance monitoring. 
A.  Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the department. In addition, any sworn peace officer or City of El Monte Code Enforcement Officer may enforce the penal provisions of this chapter. The city may designate any number of additional persons to monitor compliance with this chapter. 
B.  The department or other person designated to enforce the provisions of this chapter shall check the compliance of each tobacco retailer at least once per twelve-month period. Nothing in this paragraph shall create a right of action in any permittee or other person against the city or its agents. 
C.  Compliance checks shall be conducted so as to allow the department to determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco retailer is conducting business in a manner that complies with laws regulating youth access to Tobacco. When the department deems appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance with other laws applicable to tobacco retailing. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011)  
8.10.110 - Suspension/revocation of permit. 
A.  Suspension of Permit for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer permit shall be suspended or revoked if any court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of the evidence, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the permittee, or any of the permittee's agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements, conditions, or prohibitions of this part or has pleaded guilty, "no contest" or its equivalent, or admitted to a violation of any law designated in Section 8.10.020 of this chapter. A tobacco retailer or proprietor whose permit has been suspended is deemed not to have a valid tobacco retailer permit during the suspension period for purposes of this chapter. 
B.  Tobacco Retailer Permit Suspension/Revocation.

4.  After revocation for four or more violations of this part at a location within any three-year period, no new permit may issue for the location until one year has passed from the date of revocation. 
C.  Appeal of Suspension/Revocation. A decision of the department to suspend or revoke a permit is appealable to the City Manager and/or designee and must be filed with the City Clerk or within ten (10) days of mailing of the department's decision. If such an appeal is made, it shall stay enforcement of the appealed action. An appeal to the City Manager or designee is not available for a suspension or revocation made pursuant to subsection (D) of this section. 
D.  Revocation of Permit Wrongly Issued. A tobacco retailer permit shall be revoked if the department finds, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a permit under Section 8.10.050 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the permit issued. The decision by the department shall be the final decision of the city. Such a revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new permit application. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011; Ord. No. 2789, 3-20-2012)  
8.10.120 - Tobacco retailing without a permit. 
A.  In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of evidence, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that any person has engaged in tobacco retailing at a location without a valid tobacco retailer's permit, either directly or through the person's agents or employees, the person shall be ineligible to apply for, or to be issued, a tobacco retailing permit as follows: 
1.  After a first violation of this section at a location within any five-year period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm's length transaction), until thirty (30) days have passed from the date of the violation. 
2.  After a second violation of this section at a location within any five-year period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm's length transaction), until ninety (90) days have passed from the date of the violation. 
B.  Tobacco products offered for sale or exchange in violation of this section are subject to seizure by the department or any peace officer and shall be forfeited after the permittee and any other owner of the tobacco products seized is given reasonable notice and an opportunity to demonstrate that the tobacco products were not offered for sale or exchange in violation of this chapter. The decision by the department may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 8.10.110(C). 
C.  For the purposes of the civil remedies provided in this chapter: 
1.  Each day on which a tobacco product is offered for sale in violation of this chapter; or 
2.  Each individual retail tobacco product that is distributed, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this chapter; 
shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2781, § 1, 11-15-2011; Ord. No. 2789, 3-20-2012)  
8.10.130 - Enforcement.

(Ord. No. 2908, § 1, 1-24-2017)  
8.20.261 - C&D diversion requirements. 
A.  Sixty-five (65) percent waste diversion, or the State-mandated construction and demolition diversion percentage as set forth and established in the current edition of the California Green Building Standards Code, whichever is greater, for covered projects. Each covered project applicant shall cause at least sixty-five (65) percent, or the State-mandated construction and demolition diversion percentage, whichever is greater, by weight of C&D materials generated by the covered project to be diverted from landfilling or other form of disposal. 
B.  Calculating Compliance. As a means of confirming compliance with subsection A of this section, the diversion of C&D materials shall be calculated by dividing (1) the total weight of C&D materials generated by but diverted from a covered project; by (2) the total weight of all wastes generated by the covered project. The total weight of all wastes generated by a covered project equals the sum of: (1) all C&D materials generated by but diverted from the covered project; plus (2) the weight of all other waste generated by the covered project. The calculations used to ascertain compliance with the diversion requirements of this section must be based upon the data documented by and derived from weight receipts and recycling receipts issued by any and all facilities that receive an applicant's C&D materials and/or nondiverted wastes. The City Council, by resolution, may also require such additional documentation as may be required to precisely and reliably verify compliance provided the city's request for such additional documentation does not conflict with approved guidelines or protocols of the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. 
C.  Performance Security. 
1.  Any person who applies for a demolition, building, encroachment and/or grading permit in connection with a covered project shall submit, along with an application for the same, a performance security in an amount time to time, amended, by way of a City Council resolution.

2.  If the Chief Building Official determines the applicant has complied with the diversion mandates of this section, he or she shall cause the performance security to be released to the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date the Chief Building Official issues written notice of compliance. The performance security shall also be released if the Chief Building Official determines that the performance security was erroneously paid or collected; or that permit(s) applied for in connection with the covered project have been expressly withdrawn in writing before any work authorized under any permit(s) has commenced; in either event, the performance security shall be refunded within thirty (30) days from the date the Chief Building Official is reasonably satisfied that either circumstance applies. 
3.  If the Chief Building Official determines the applicant has failed to comply with the diversion mandates of this section, the applicant shall forfeit that percentage of the total deposit equivalent the percentage by which the applicant has failed to meet the mandated diversion requirements (example: if fifty two percent (52%) diversion is reached as compared to the sixty-five (65%) diversion requirement, then eighty (80%) of the security deposit may be returned to the applicant). The applicant's failure to meet the diversion requirements of this section notwithstanding, the amount of a partial refund afforded an applicant may be increased if the work performed pursuant to a city-issued permit(s) results in the covered project obtaining certification under the "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design" ("LEED") green building rating system of the United States Green Building Council. The amount of the refund credit shall be in accordance with a credit schedule established, and from time to time amended, by City Council resolution. The amount of the credit received shall correlate with the level of certification obtained and such other criteria as may be established by City Council resolution.

Chapter 8.44 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
Sections: 
 
8.44.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  In order to further the stated goals of the city and to protect its citizens and their property from conditions which are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and community appearance, or hazardous or injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public, the City Council has determined that this chapter pertaining to nuisance abatement is necessary to effectively abate or prevent the development of such conditions in the city. 
B.  It is the intention of the City Council, in adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter, to set forth guidelines for determining what conditions constitute a public nuisance; to establish a method for giving notice of the conditions and an opportunity to correct; and finally in the event the public nuisance is not abated or corrected, to provide a procedure for a hearing and determination of the facts and manner in which the conditions shall be corrected or removed. 
C.  It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a just, equitable, and practical method, in addition to any other remedy available at law or equity, whereby lands or buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, dangerous, unsanitary, cluttered with weeds and/or debris, abandoned vehicles, machinery or equipment, or are a menace, or hazard to life, limb, safety, health, morals, property values, aesthetic standards, or the general welfare of the city, may be required to be repaired, renovated, vacated, demolished, made safe, or cleaned up by removal of offensive conditions. 
D.  In addition to the abatement procedures provided herein, this chapter declares certain conditions to be public nuisances and that maintenance of such conditions shall be a misdemeanor. 
E.  This chapter is not intended to enforce Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions (CC&R's) on property, nor to supersede them. This chapter will be enforced uniformly within the city regardless of CC&R's. Therefore, this chapter does not abrogate the right of any homeowner's association or private citizen to take action, legal or as otherwise provided in the CC&R's, to force compliance with the CC&R's applicable to their tract or association even though the CC&R provisions may be the same, more restrictive, or may not be covered by this chapter.

(Ord. 2704 §§ 13, 14 (part), 15 (part), 2007; Ord. 2691 § 1 (part), 2007)  
8.54.110 - Declaration of public nuisance. 
A.  The abandonment of carts on public property or upon the public right-of-way (including, but not limited to, public streets and sidewalks) as well as the unauthorized abandonment of carts upon private property constitutes a public nuisance that adversely effects the public health, safety and welfare in multiple ways set forth in subsection B of this section below. 
B.  The El Monte City Council has adopted this chapter in consideration of the following findings: 
1.  Abandoned carts contribute to visual blight that adversely impacts the image and quality of life in a community by contributing to a sense and atmosphere of neglect, decay, and public apathy. Abandoned carts can also become unsightly receptacles for trash and other debris and can even become trash themselves when damaged. The proliferation of abandoned carts also has an adverse impact on property values and generally undermines efforts to promote individual responsibility for the maintenance, upkeep and appearance of a community. 
2.  Abandoned carts are potential hazards to pedestrians and motorists alike as they can roll onto, or block, pedestrian and motor vehicle rights-of-way and even block sidewalk access to wheelchair bound residents and other persons with impaired mobility. 
3.  As determined by the American Academy of Pediatrics and news media reports on the subject, the design of many carts poses an inherent danger to young children in the form of tip-overs even when parents are present. It follows that abandoned carts pose an even greater threat to children who are attracted to carts, in the absence of any parental supervision whatsoever, when such devices are left abandoned on public streets, parks or other places where children pass or congregate. 
4.  Stolen and abandoned carts are all too frequently used to facilitate the unlawful scavenging of recyclable materials from City-authorized waste receptacles thereby undermining the City's efforts to meet certain recycling and waste diversion goals. 
5.  A significant number of the carts collected at the City's expense included carts that were not promptly collected by business establishments, including those who purportedly retain the services of companies in the business of shopping cart or laundry cart retrieval. The delayed or untimely retrieval of carts increases the likelihood that they will cause harm and/or be misused. 
6.  Although the installation of physical containment measures will involve an initial investment in containment equipment, a long term savings should be realized by business establishments, consumers/residents, and the City as the need for costly ongoing retrieval is diminished. 
7.  Section 22435 et seq. of the California Business and Professions Code (hereinafter, the "State Scheme"). The state scheme relates to the following: (i) the manner by which abandoned carts which satisfy certain marking and identification requirements set forth under Business and Professions Code Section 22435.1 may be impounded by municipalities; (ii) the circumstances under which certain statutorily specified penalties and costs may (or may not) be imposed upon the owner of a properly marked cart as a result of its abandonment by a third-party and subsequent impoundment by a municipality; and (iii) the circumstances under which the removal, alteration or abandonment of a properly marked cart may be deemed unlawful and thereby become punishable as a misdemeanor. 
8.  In recognition of finding in subsection (B)(7) of this section, this chapter is not in conflict with, or otherwise preempted by, the provisions of the state scheme in that provisions of this chapter do not expressly conflict with any provision of the state scheme and largely track the provisions of the state scheme. 
9.  This chapter is found to satisfy the provisions of Business and Professions Code Section 22435.8 which provides that the state scheme (Business and Professions Code Section 22435 et seq.) "shall not invalidate an ordinance of, or be construed to prohibit the adoption of an ordinance by, a City...which ordinance regulates or prohibits the removal of shopping carts or laundry carts from the premises or parking area of a retail establishment except to the extent any provision of such an ordinance expressly conflicts with any provision of the [State Scheme].

As used in this subsection (D) of Section 8.60.046 the words "short-pay agreement" mean an agreement in writing in which the beneficiary agrees to release its lien on a property in return for payment of an amount less than the secured obligation affecting the property. As also used in this subsection (D) of Section 8.60.046, the words "short-pay demand statement" means a written statement issued subsequent to and conditioned on the existence of a short-pay agreement that is prepared in response to a written demand made by a trustor or an authorized agent of such trustor, whereby a beneficiary sets forth an amount less than the outstanding debt, together with any other terms and conditions under which the beneficiary will execute and deliver a reconveyance of the deed of trust securing the note that is the subject of the short-pay demand statement. 
2.  All property which is proposed to be transferred, sold or otherwise conveyed by a trustor to a third party bona fide purchaser following the recordation of a notice of default and the issuance by the beneficiary (or its agent) of a short-pay demand statement, shall prior to the completion of such transfer, sale or other conveyance, be subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 17.16.040. The beneficiary, and each of its agents who cause to be recorded the reconveyance of the deed of trust securing the note that is subject to the short-pay agreement, shall each be responsible for obtaining compliance with Section 17.16.040, in the event that the bona fide purchaser may fail to provide the City with an acceptable surety for such compliance prior to the recordation of the reconveyance of the deed of trust described in the short-pay demand statement.

Chapter 8.70 - MOBILEHOME PARK RENT STABILIZATION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2860, § 2, adopted Aug. 4, 2015, amended Ch. 8.70 in its entirety, in effect repealing and reenacting said chapter to read as set out herein. The former Ch. 8.70, §§ 8.70.0108.70.160, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2829, § 1, adopted Sept. 3, 2013; Ord. No. 2837, § 2, adopted May 13, 2014; Ord. No. 2843, § 2, adopted July 8, 2014; Ord. No. 2852, § 3, adopted March 30, 2015; and Ord. No. 2855, § 3, adopted June 2, 2015. 
 
8.70.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  The purposes of this chapter are to: 
1.  Prevent excessive and unreasonable increases in mobilehome park space rents. 
2.  Preserve the availability of available mobilehome park spaces in the city. 
3.  Enable mobilehome owners to preserve their equity in their mobilehomes. 
4.  Permit mobilehome park owners to receive a fair return. 
5.  Help preserve the affordability of space rents within the city. 
B.  In the city, there are thirty-three (33) mobilehome parks with one thousand four hundred twenty-seven (1,427) spaces for mobilehomes. 
C.  The mobilehome parks in the city are very diverse in terms of size and facilities. 
D.  The survey conducted as part of the study found a very low level of household incomes among mobilehome owners. Forty-eight (48) percent of the households responding to the city had an annual income under fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). Fourteen and three-tenths (14.3) percent had an annual income between fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) and nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars ($19,999). 
E.  A survey of fifty (50) mobilehome parks in other cities in the area confirmed that the rate of vacant spaces is very low  one and thirty-four hundredths (1.34) percent  and indicated that turnover in mobilehome ownership in mobilehome parks is low  usually under ten (10) percent per year and commonly under five (5) percent per year. 
F.  Of the fifty (50) parks surveyed in other cities, none reported a higher average rent than one thousand twenty-five dollars ($1,025.00). In the largest mobilehome park in the city, which contains over one-quarter of the mobilehome spaces in the city, the average rent is one thousand two hundred forty-three dollars ($1,243.00). 
G.  If a mobilehome owner in the city cannot afford the rents in the mobilehome park he or she is residing in and desires to move into another mobilehome park, it would be necessary for him or her to purchase a mobilehome already in the other park, because only newer mobilehomes would be accepted in another mobilehome park. 
H.  The survey conducted as part of the study found that sixty-three and nine-tenths (63.9) percent of mobilehome park residents who responded live in singlewide mobilehomes and thirty-five and four-tenths (35.4) percent live in doublewide mobilehomes. 
I.  The survey conducted as part of the study, found that a majority of respondents had purchased their mobilehomes for under fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). Eighty (80) percent of the singlewide homes purchase prices costs fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) or less. 
J.  Approximately ninety (90) jurisdictions in California have rent stabilization ordinances. Generally, such ordinances apply to all of the mobilehome parks in the jurisdiction except for very small parks (e.g. less than ten (10) spaces). 
K.  For the purposes of meeting constitutional fair return standards under rent stabilization, a maintenance of net operating income ("MNOI") standard is a "fairly constructed formula." Rainbow Disposal Co. v. Escondido Mobilehome Rent Review Bd. (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th 1159. 
L.  Adoption of this chapter is not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to Section 15060(c)(2), as the activity will not result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and Section 15060(c)(3), as the activity is not a project as defined in Section 15378 of the CEQA Guidelines because it has no potential for resulting in physical change to the environment, directly or indirectly.

A.  Annual Rent Increases Starting in 2016. Starting in 2016, on or after May 1 of each year, the rent may be increased over the allowable rent as of May 1 of the prior year by one hundred (100) percent of the percentage increase in the CPI last reported as of January 30 in the current year over the CPI last reported as of January 30 in the prior year.

(Ord. No. 2860, § 2, 8-4-2015)  
8.70.080 - Fair return standard. 
A.  Right of the Mobilehome Park Owner to Request Special Rent Increase. It is expected that a rent increase within the limits of Section 8.70.060 will provide the mobilehome park owner with a fair and reasonable return. However, in the event a rent increase as set forth in Section 8.70.060 does not provide the park owner with a fair and reasonable return, the mobilehome park owner may request an increase in excess of said amounts by filing a petition for rent adjustment in order to obtain a fair return, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 8.70.080 and 8.70.090. 
B.  Presumption of Fair Return. For the purposes of determining the rent adjustment necessary to provide the park owner with a fair and reasonable return, it shall be presumed that the net operating income, as described below, received by the park owner in the base year, provided the park owner with a fair and reasonable return. 
C.  Base Year and Current Year. 
1.  "Base year" means the 2012 calendar year. The base year net operating income shall be determined by subtracting the actual operating expenses for the base year from the gross income realized during the base year. 
2.  "Current year" net operating income shall be determined by annualizing the rents in effect as of the day of the mobilehome park owner's filing of a petition for rent adjustment to determine the annualized gross income and subtracting from such amount the operating expenses during the immediate preceding calendar year. 
D.  Adjustment of Base Year Net Operating Income. The park owner or mobilehome owners may present evidence to rebut the presumption of fair return in Section 8.70.080 based upon evidence provided by the mobilehome park owner to the city of gross income, operating expenses, and the determination of net operating income for the base year and current year. The presumption of fair return in Section 8.70.080 may be rebutted if at least one of the following findings is made: 
1.  Exceptional Expenses in the Base Year. The park owner's operating expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating operating expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. The following factors shall be considered in making such a finding: 
a.  Extraordinary amounts were expended for necessary maintenance and repairs. 
b.  Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of services provided. 
c.  Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the application of prudent business practices. 
2.  Exceptional Circumstances in the Base Year. The gross income during the base year was disproportionately low due to exceptional circumstances. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating base year gross rental income consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The following factors shall be considered in making such a finding: 
a.  If the gross income during the base year was lower than it might have been because some residents were charged reduced rent. 
b.  If the gross income during the base year was significantly lower than normal because of the destruction of the premises and/or temporary eviction for construction or repairs. 
c.  The pattern of rent increases in the years prior to the base year and whether those increases reflected increases in the CPI. 
d.  Base period rents were disproportionately low in comparison to the base period rents of other comparable parks in the city. 
e.  Other exceptional circumstances. 
E.  Calculation of Net Operating Income. 
1.  Net Operating Income. Net operating income shall be calculated by subtracting operating expenses from gross rental income. 
2.  Gross Rental Income. 
a.  Gross rental income shall include:

vii.  Costs of Capital Replacements. Costs of capital replacements plus an interest allowance to cover the amortization of those costs where all of the following conditions are met: 
(A)  The capital improvement is made at a direct cost of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per affected rental unit or at a total direct cost of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), whichever is lower.

(F)  At the end of the amortization period, the allowable monthly rent is decreased by any amount it was increased because of the application of this provision. 
(G)  The amortization period shall be in conformance with a schedule adopted by the City Manager unless it is determined that an alternate period is justified based on the evidence presented in the hearing. 
viii.  Legal Expenses. Attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with successful good faith attempts to recover rents owing, successful good faith unlawful detainer actions not in derogation of applicable law, and legal expenses necessarily incurred in dealings with respect to the normal operation of the park to the extent such expenses are not recovered from adverse or other parties, subject to the following requirements: 
Reasonable fees, expenses, and other costs incurred in the course of successfully pursuing rights under or in relationship to this chapter and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter including costs incurred in the course of pursuing successful fair return petitions. Said expenses shall be amortized over a five-year period, unless the City Manager concludes that a differing period is more reasonable. 
Recovery of expenses incurred in the course of preparing and presenting a fair return petition shall be limited when a park owner rejects a settlement offer and then does not recover more than proposed settlement. The purpose of this limitation is to encourage both park owners and mobilehome owners to minimize, to the extent possible, the cost and expense of fair rate of return mobilehome space rent administrative proceedings by providing a mechanism for the early settlement of fair rate of return administrative proceedings. 
At any time after filing a fair rate of return rent application, the designated representative of the residents of the mobilehome park may serve an offer in writing to the mobilehome park owner who has filed that petition to stipulate to a compromise amount for the fair rate of return rent increase requested in the petition. The designated representative shall also file a copy of this written settlement offer with the city in a separately sealed envelope and with a statement on the outside of the envelope stating that it is a written settlement offer pursuant to this subsection. 
The sealed copy of the written settlement offer that is so filed with the city is not to be opened by the city until it is either accepted by the park owner or, if it is not accepted by the park owner, after a final rent increase award or denial has been made on the park owner's petition by either the City Manager or by the hearing officer. Upon receiving such offer to compromise, the mobilehome park owner has seven (7) days to accept the offer by filing a written acceptance with the City Clerk. 
A mobilehome park owner is not entitled to recover a portion of application expenses, fees, or other costs that are incurred following the submission of a prevailing offer and the residents may recover reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the residents after the rejection of a "prevailing" offer. The designated mobilehome owners' representative shall be determined to have made a prevailing offer if a settlement offer has been made and that offer has not been accepted by the park owner within seven (7) days after the making of that offer, and the park owner's rent increase award fails to exceed the amount of that settlement offer. 
Allowable legal expenses which are of a nature that does not recur annually shall be amortized over a reasonable period of time. At the end of the amortization period, the allowable monthly rent shall be decreased by any amount it was increased because of the application of this provision. 
ix.  Interest Allowance for Expenses that are Amortized. An interest allowance shall be allowed on the cost of amortized expenses; the allowance shall be the interest rate on the cost of the amortized expense equal to the "average rate" for thirty-year fixed rate on home mortgages plus two (2) percent. The "average rate" shall be the rate Freddie Mac last published in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) as of the date of the initial submission of the petition. In the event that this rate is no longer published, the index which is most comparable to the PMMS index shall be used. 
b.  Exclusions from Operating Expenses. Operating expenses shall not include the following: 
i.  Mortgage principal or interest payments or other debt service costs. 
ii.  Any penalties, fees or interest assessed or awarded for violation of any provision of this chapter or of any other provision of law. 
iii.  Land lease expenses. 
iv.  Political contributions and payments to organizations which are substantially devoted to legislative lobbying purposes. 
v.  Depreciation. 
vi.  Any expenses for which the landlord has been reimbursed by any utility rebate or discount, security deposit, insurance settlement, judgment for damages, settlement or any other method or device. 
vii.  Unreasonable increases in expenses since the base year. 
viii.  Expenses associated with the provision of master-metered gas and electricity services. 
ix.  Expenses which are attributable to unreasonable delays in performing necessary maintenance or repair work or the failure to complete necessary replacements (e.g., a roof replacement may be a reasonable expense, but if water damage occurred as a result of unreasonable delays in repairing or replacing the roof, it would not be reasonable to pass through the cost of repairing the water damage). 
c.  Adjustments of Operating Expenses. Base year and/or current operating expenses may be averaged with other expense levels for other years or amortized or adjusted by the CPI or may otherwise be adjusted, in order to establish an expense amount for that item which most reasonably serves the objectives of obtaining a reasonable comparison of base year and current year expenses. Grounds for such adjustments include, but are not limited to: 
i.  An expense item for a particular year is not representative; 
ii.  The base year expense is not a reasonable projection of average past expenditures for that item in the years immediately preceding or following the base year; 
iii.  The current year expense is not a reasonable projection of expenditures for that item in recent years or of future expenditures for that item; 
iv.  A particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other comparable standard for the area, the park owner shall bear the burden of proving the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that it is found that the expense is unreasonable it may be adjusted to reflect the normal industry standard; 
v.  A base year expense is exceptionally low by industry standards and/or on an inflation adjusted basis is exceptionally low relative to current year expenses although the level or type of service has not changed significantly; 
vi.  An increase in maintenance or management expenses is disproportionate to the percentage increase in the CPI, while the level of services has not changed significantly and/or is not justified by special circumstances. 
F.  Rent Increases for Periods Preceding Date that a Park Owner May Implement Rent Increases pursuant to this Section. In the event that the period for determining the allowable rent increase pursuant to this section exceeds one hundred twenty (120) days, the park owner may recover increases that would have been permitted if the rent increase decision had been made within one hundred twenty (120) days. The allowance for these increases may be amortized or may be factored into the prospective allowable increase in order to avoid undue hardship on the mobilehome owners. 
G.  Per Space Rent Adjustment pursuant to Fair Return Standard. The allowable rent increase per mobilehome park space pursuant to this section shall not be increased as a result of the fact that there are exempt spaces in the park. 
H.  Assurance of a Fair Return. It shall be presumed that the MNOI standard provides a fair return. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City Manager or hearing officer from granting an increase that is necessary in order to meet constitutional fair return requirements.

Chapter 8.79 - TENANT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE 
 
8.79.010 - Findings. 
The City Council finds and determines that: 
A.  Some rental units in the city have severe building code violations which are so extensive and extreme that they threaten the health and safety of tenants and require the units or rooms to be vacated to allow for repairs to take place. 
B.  Such building code violations are often caused by deferred maintenance and may breach the landlord's implied warranty of habitability and sometimes constitute constructive eviction of the tenant household from its residence. 
C.  Health and Safety Code Section 17975 requires property owners or designated agent to pay certain relocation expenses when the need to relocate arises from violations which are so extensive and of such a nature that the immediate health and safety of the tenants is endangered. 
D.  Financial hardship often arises because relocating generally requires large sum of moneys, including first and last month's rent, deposits, moving expenses and utility deposits for a new residence. Low-income tenants are typically unable to obtain such sums and, as a result, are at great risk of becoming homeless. 
E.  Health and Safety Code Sections 17975.1 and 17975.2 specify the timing and level of payments the property owner must provide. If a tenant is entitled to relocation benefits, the Building Official or designee must provide either telephonic or written notice to the tenant of his or her entitlement to the benefits. Written notice may be satisfied by posting notice on the premises stating that tenants may be entitled to relocation benefits. 
F.  The delayed payment of relocation benefits by the property owner, or designated agent, may impose extreme hardship upon tenants who then must themselves obtain the large sums of money necessary to relocate. Delayed payment may also require the city to expend general funds to provide tenants with financial assistance for relocation. Any requirement to pay relocation benefits should contain disincentives for delayed payment in the form of appropriate penalties. 
G.  Health and Safety Code Section 17975.5 authorizes the city to adopt an ordinance that allows the city at its sole discretion, to advance relocation payments to tenants where the property owner, or designated agent, fails, neglects, or refuses to pay displaced tenants and to subsequently collect from the property owner any amount paid to displaced tenants, along with an additional penalty amount, which shall not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00.) 
H.  This chapter is adopted pursuant to Health and Safety Code Sections 17975 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 2921, § 3, 8-1-2017)  
8.79.020 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply: 
"Displaced tenant" means a tenant that is ordered to move out of a residential unit or structure by an order to vacate issued by the city or another enforcement agency. 
"Order to vacate" means the first notice sent by an authorized city official to the property owner and posted on the affected property declaring that, due to a failure to repair or maintain, the unit or structure must be vacated. 
"Property owner" means the owner of the property at the time the order to vacate is issued, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and any successor in interest. 
"Residential unit or structure" means any dwelling, apartment, room or place which is the place of permanent or customary and usual abode of any person or household. Residential unit or structure shall include mobile homes located in mobilehome parks, provided that the city has assumed enforcement authority over such parks from the State Department of Housing and Community Development. 
"Tenant" means any resident of the affected property who is a tenant as that term is used in California Civil Code Sections 1940 et seq. 
"Vacation date" means the date by which a tenant is required to vacate a unit or structure, pursuant to an order by an authorized city official. 
(Ord. No. 2921, § 3, 8-1-2017)  
8.79.030 - Eligibility for relocation benefits and appeal. 
A.  A tenant shall be eligible for relocation assistance and payments pursuant to this chapter and Health and Safety Code Sections 17975 et seq. when the city determines that the condition of a building or portion thereof is such that a residential unit cannot be safely occupied by that tenant while the building or portion thereof is being brought into code compliance. 
B.  Exceptions: A tenant shall not be eligible for relocation assistance and payments under the following conditions: 
1.  Within twenty-nine (29) days from the vacation date, the tenant is offered the right to return to the rehabilitated unit upon clearance by the appropriate code enforcement official. The tenant may still assert his/her rights and remedies under the law to recover its losses and damages for the period in which it was required to vacate the premises; 
2.  The property owner provides a replacement dwelling of comparable size and appurtenances to the tenant; 
3.  The tenant has caused or substantially contributed to the condition giving rise to the order to vacate or unreasonably prevented the property owner or designated agent from undertaking maintenance or repairs that would have prevented or rectified the code violation. Nor shall any relocation benefits be payable to a tenant if any guest or invitee of the tenant has caused or substantially contributed to the condition giving rise to the order to vacate, as determined by the Building Official or designee. The Building Official or designee shall make the determination whether a tenant, tenant's guest, or invitee caused or substantially contributed to the condition, giving rise to the order to vacate; 
4.  If the residential unit or structure becomes unsafe or hazardous as a result of a natural disaster or act of God; 
5.  If the residential unit or structure is operated as an emergency or temporary shelter for homeless persons (whether such persons have assigned rooms or beds, and regardless of duration of stay by any occupant) by a nonprofit organization or public agency owning, leasing, or managing such dwelling unit; or 
6.  The tenant is in default in payment of rent, unless rent is being lawfully withheld by the tenant. 
C.  The Building Official shall have sole discretion to determine the amount, type and duration of the relocation benefits pursuant to this chapter and Health and Safety Code Sections 17975 et seq. The property owner or designated agent and any displaced tenant or his or her representative shall be entitled to meet with the Building Official to present facts demonstrating that relocation benefits should or should not be paid. The Building Official or designee shall make a determination based on the provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, and the factual information submitted by the parties or otherwise readily available and shall communicate his or her determination in writing to the tenant and the property owner or designated agent. When notice to the property owner of the Building Official's relocation benefits determination is not reasonably possible because immediate vacation is necessary, the property owner shall have only the appeal right set forth in Section 8.79.050. 
D.  When the property owner or tenant wishes to contest a determination regarding eligibility or relocation payment amounts made by the Building Official, such party should file a written request for a hearing with the city manager or designee within seven (7) days of the determination. Any property owner requesting an appeal must first deposit with the Building Official the full unpaid amount in dispute, unless the property owner can demonstrate significant hardship or other extraordinary circumstances to The Building Official that would justify a waiver of such deposit. The City Manager or designee shall hold a hearing and shall use reasonable efforts to render his or her decision on any such appeal within thirty (30) days of a timely hearing request. The City Manager's or designee's decision shall be final with no appeal to the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 2921, § 3, 8-1-2017)  
8.79.040 - Payment of relocation costs by city. 
A.  In the event the property owner or designated agent fails, neglects or refuses to pay relocation benefits as required by this chapter to a displaced tenant, the City Council with a recommendation from a committee consisting of the City Manager, City Attorney, Economic Development Director, and the Chief Building Official may at its sole discretion and within budgetary limitations, opt to make payment of such relocation benefits as determines is necessary to assist the displaced tenant to relocate, up to the amount payable by the property owner under this chapter and Health and Safety Code Section 17975.2. 
B.  The city may recover from the property owner any amount paid to a tenant pursuant to this chapter. As a penalty for failure to make a timely payment to the displaced tenant, the city shall also be entitled to recover from the property owner an additional amount, not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), which is equal to one-half (½) the amount so paid. The city shall also be entitled to recover from property owner its actual costs (including direct and indirect costs) of administering the provision of benefits to the displaced tenant. 
C.  Any amount paid by the city and any applicable penalties and administrative costs shall be a personal obligation of the property owner and may be recorded as a lien against the property with the county recorder if the property owner fails to pay the city. 
D.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall require the city to pay any relocation benefits to any tenant, or to assume any obligation, requirement, or duty of the property owner or designated agent pursuant to this chapter. 
E.  The damages which a displaced tenant may receive from the property owner under Health and Safety Code Section 17975.2 shall be reduced by the amount of any benefits received from the city. 
(Ord. No. 2921, § 3, 8-1-2017)  
8.79.050 - Recovery of relocation costs by cityNotice, hearing, appeal. 
A.  Prior to instituting any action to collect relocation payments from the property owner or to record a lien pursuant to this chapter, the Building Official or designee shall send to the property owner by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at the property owner's address as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, an itemized accounting of all benefits paid by the city to the property owner's tenants, and any penalties or costs the city is seeking to recover. 
B.  If the property owner contends that not all of the benefits are chargeable to the property owner because the recipients were not displaced tenants, or on other grounds, the property owner shall submit a written appeal to the Building Official within twenty (20) days after receipt of the itemized accounting. The Building Official, or designee, shall hold an administrative hearing for the purpose of determining the amount of benefits and any penalties or costs. 
C.  The Building Official's decision may be appealed to the City Manager within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the service of the Building Official's written decision.

The decision shall include reference to this section and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. 
D.  If the property owner fails to obtain a more favorable decision than that set forth in the itemized accounting, the property owner or designated agent shall be liable to the city for the costs of the administrative hearing and appeal, not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The failure to receive the itemized accounting shall not relieve the property owner of any obligation to the city. 
E.  Notwithstanding Section 8.79.040(b) of this chapter, if there are fewer than ten (10) days between the first posting and mailing of the order to vacate and the vacation date, and if the city advances relocation benefits to any tenant, no penalty shall be payable by the property owner if reimbursement is made to the city within thirty (30) days after the date an itemized accounting from the city is mailed as set forth in this section.

Chapter 9.08 - GRAFFITI PREVENTION, PROHIBITION AND REMOVAL 
Sections: 
 
9.08.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of this section is to help prevent the spread of graffiti and to establish a program for its removal from city-owned property and non-city owned property within the city of El Monte. 
B.  California Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed material from private as well as public property. The City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and unless the city causes it to be removed from city-owned and non-city owned property within the city of El Monte, it tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
C.  It is the purpose of the City Council of the city of El Monte, through the adoption of this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement, including the application of graffiti on walls, natural objects and structures. Such acts are destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community.

b.  The police chief, code enforcement supervisor, department of public works supervisor or his or her designee or any additional city department head, as authorized by the City Council, shall notify, in writing the owner or possessor of the property upon which graffiti has been abated by the city, the cost of said abatement in accordance with Section 25845 of the Government Code.

From the date of such recording, the balance due will constitute a lien on the property. The lien will continue in full force and effect until the entire amount due, together with interest as the maximum legal rate accruing from the date of the completion of the abatement, is paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no lien shall be placed on a single-family residence which is owner occupied.

The city may also, in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the State of California, cause the amount due to the city by reason of its abating graffiti together with interest at the maximum legal rate, accruing from the date of completion of the abatement, to be charged to the owners of the property, on the next regular bill.

Such drawing shall be open to the public and conducted at a time and date designated by the Director. 
O.  Each machine shall conform to the Director's as well as the Permit Committee's rules and regulations, including, without limitation, reasonable design standards.

Editor's note The schedule of fire protection water service charges set forth under subsection A of Section 13.040.040 are supported by that certain water rate study prepared by CDM Smith, Inc., working in association with Tuckfield Associates dated October 28, 2014 ("Water Rate Study"). The Water Rate Study was accepted and approved by the City Council at its meeting of October 28, 2014 and affirmed at its meeting of December 16, 2014 following the close of a duly noticed majority protest hearing in which the City Clerk determined that the total number of affected real property parcels for which written protests were submitted was less than fifty (50) percent of the total number of affected parcels.

(Ord. No. 2846, § 5, 11-12-2014)  
13.04.050 - Billing and collections of water service commodity charges and water service meter base charges. 
A.  The charges set forth under Sections 13.04,020 through 13.04.040 of this chapter are billed to water customers on a bi-monthly basis in arrears For purposes of illustration only, charges applicable to the months of January and February of a given year will be billed by the city in the month of March of the same year and charges applicable to the months of March and April of a given year, as another example, will be billed by the city in the month of May of the same year and so on. Each water service bill issued by the city is due and payable as soon as it is tendered by the city to a water customer and shall become delinquent if not paid in full within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the bill is issued by the city. If a water service bill is becomes delinquent, a penalty in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the amount of the bill shall also be added to the balance due and payable to the Water Department and such adjusted amount shall be immediately due and payable by the water customer to the city. If a water service bill becomes delinquent, the Water Department shall also issue a shutoff notice to the water customer and the city shall also assess and include to the water customers outstanding account balance five dollars ($5.00) for the delivery cost of the shut-off notice. The foregoing notwithstanding, the issuance of a shut-off notice by the city shall not be pre-condition to the water customers ongoing duty to immediately pay all past due sums, plus interest, applicable processing fees and penalties. If the delinquent bill, plus all penalties and fees, is not paid in full by the lock-off date indicated in the shut-off notice and water service is disconnected by the city, an additional penalty amount of thirty dollars ($30.00) shall be charged to the water customer. 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, billings may be made and charges collected for service furnished to any consumer at such times as the City Council shall consider to be in the best interest of the Water Department and the water customer so billed. 
C.  If a water meter is "locked off" (i.e., shut off) by the Water Department due to nonpayment by the water customer, and the lock is damaged or removed, a ten dollar ($10.00) charge will be added to the water customer's account to replace the lock. If a lock is removed from a meter, the meter may be subject to immediate removal by the Water Department without further notice to prevent fraud, further damage or unauthorized use of water services. A fifty dollar ($50.00) charge will be added to the customer's account in the event of such removal by the city. In the event that a meter has been removed by the Water Department and thereafter the customer's premises is reconnected to the public water supply system without the prior approval of the Water Department, the city may impose a civil penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each day following the date of removal of the meter to the date of discovery of the illegal service connection in addition to all other civil and criminal penalties which may be imposed upon the customer under applicable law. The customer's account must be paid in full before a water meter which has been removed by the Water Department pursuant to this subsection will be reinstalled. 
D.  If a water customer account is closed, and the final billing is not paid within thirty (30) days after the closing date, the balance due on the closed and delinquent account (plus all penalties and fees) will be transferred to any other open Water Department account that is in the customer's name. An additional twenty-five dollar ($25.00) charge shall be payable by the customer for the transfer of such a balance to an open account. 
E.  The owner of real property which is rented for occupancy to third parties shall be liable for nonpayment of a water service account otherwise payable to the Water Department by their tenant(s) as provided in this subsection. After a water shut-off order has been executed on a service connection as provided in this section, above, the Water Department shall not restore water service or authorize a change in the name in the customer account unless the owner of the property (or the new tenant on behalf of the owner) has first paid the delinquent amount to the Water Department, plus all penalties and fees. The charges imposed under Sections 13.04.020 through 13.04.040 are established under the authority of Division 5, Part 3, Chapter 6, Article 4 (Sanitation and Sewerage Systems) of the California Health and Safety Code (Health and Safety Code Section 5470 et seq.) To the fullest extent permitted by law, all delinquent sums owed to the city which are imposed under the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a lien upon the real property parcel corresponding to the delinquent water service account. Accordingly, the city, having complied with the procedural requirements of Government Code Section 53755(a)(3) and the procedural and approval requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 5473, may, pursuant to and in compliance to Health and Safety Code Section 5473a, collect all such delinquent sums on the tax roll in the same manner, by the same persons, and at the same time as, together with and not separately from its general taxes. 
F.  A charge of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), or an amount equal to the actual cost to the Water Department, whichever is greater, shall be payable by each customer who requests maintenance work from the Water Department at a time other than regular business hours for Water Department field service personnel ("after hours charge").

The former Ch. 13.20, §§ 13.20.01013.20.270, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 2568 §§ 14, 6, 8, 9, 2002; Ord. 2529 § 1 (part), 2001; and Ord. 2573 §§ 17, 2002. 
 
13.20.010 - Definitions. 
Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this Chapter 13.20 shall be defined as that term in the current municipal NPDES permit, or if it is not specifically defined in either the municipal NPDES permit, then as such term is defined in the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and/or the regulations promulgated thereunder. If the definition of any term contained in this chapter conflicts with the definition of the same term in the current municipal NPDES permit in effect at the city at the time of development application, then the definition contained in the municipal NPDES permit shall govern. The following words and phrases shall have the following meanings when used in this chapter: 
"Automotive service facility" means a facility that is categorized in any one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. For inspection purposes, city need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511, provided that these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to stormwater.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the "Low Impact Development (LID) Ordinance of the city of El Monte" and may be so cited. 
(Ord. No. 2840, § 2(Exh. A), 6-10-2014)  
13.20.020 - Stormwater pollution control measures for development planning and construction activities. 
A.  Objective. The provisions of this section contain requirements for site design and post-construction BMP operation and maintenance of development and redevelopment projects to comply with the city of El Monte's municipal NPDES permit (permit) currently in effect at the time of development application submittal, to lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth practices, and integrate LID design principles to mimic predevelopment hydrology through infiltration, evapotranspiration and rainfall harvest and use. 
B.  Scope. This section contains requirements for stormwater pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the city of El Monte to further define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, to develop LID principles and requirements, including but not limited to the objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, and to grant alternative compliance for technical infeasibility, as allowed by the municipal NPDES permit currently in effect at the time of development application, and collect fees from projects granted exceptions. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city of El Monte shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section. Any guidance documents supporting implementation of the municipal NPDES permit requirements, currently in effect at the time of development application submittal, meeting application in this chapter, are hereby incorporated by reference. 
C.  Applicability. This section is applicable to projects as defined below: 
1.  All development and redevelopment projects, termed "planning priority projects," as defined in the municipal NPDES permit currently in effect at the time of the development application, shall comply with subsection E of Section 13.20.020. 
2.  Street and road construction projects of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface, in addition to complying with all other applicable provisions of Section 13.20.020, shall follow USEPA guidance regarding "Managing West Weather with Green Infrastructure: Green Streets" (December 2008, EPA-833-F-08-009) to the maximum extent practicable. This subsection applies to standalone streets, roads, highways, and freeway projects, and also applies to streets within larger projects, including capital improvement projects (CIPs). 
3.  Single family hillside homes (as defined in City Code Section 13.20.010 subsection C), in addition to complying with all other applicable provisions of Section 13.20.020, shall implement the following measures: 
i.  Conserve natural areas. 
ii.  Protect slopes and channels. 
iii.  Provide storm drain stenciling and signage. 
iv.  Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would results in slope instability. 
v.  Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in slope instability. 
4.  Any other project, as deemed appropriate by the department, submitted for complete discretionary or non-discretionary permit application filed with the department after December 31, 2012. 
D.  Effective Date. The planning and land development requirements contained in this chapter shall become effective thirty (30) days from the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. This includes all applicable projects listed in subsection C of Section 13.20.020 that are discretionary permit projects or project phases that have not been deemed complete for processing, or discretionary permit projects without vesting tentative maps that have not requested and received an extension of previously granted approvals within thirty (30) days of adoption of the ordinance. Projects that have been deemed complete within thirty (30) days of adoption of the ordinance are not subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
E.  Stormwater Pollution Control Requirements. All applicable projects listed in subsection C of Section 13.20.020 shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volumes to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use. All applicable projects shall prepare a LID plan that is submitted to and approved by the Department. All LID plans shall comply with the following: 
a.  Low impact development standards and BMP implementation hierarchy: All project applicants shall: 
i.  Properly select, design and maintain LID and hydromodification control BMPs to address pollutants that are likely to be generated, reduce changes to pre-development hydrology, assure long-term function and avoid breeding of vectors. 
ii.  Prioritize the selection of BMPs to remove stormwater pollutants, reduce stormwater runoff volume, and beneficially use stormwater to support an integrated approach to protecting water quality and managing water resources in the following order: 
1.  On-site infiltration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use; then 
2.  On-site biofiltration, offsite groundwater replenishment, and/or off-site retrofit. 
a.  If using biofiltration due to demonstrated technical infeasibility, then the volume to be biofiltrated shall be calculated using the following equation: 
B v = 1.5 * [SWQD v - R v ] 
Where: 
B v = biofiltration volume 
SWQD v = the storm water runoff from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour storm or the 85th percentile storm, whichever is greater 
R v = volume reliably retained on-site 
b.  Retain onsite the stormwater quality design volume (SWQDv) as required per the permit currently in effect at the time of development application submittal. 
c.  When one hundred (100) percent onsite retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially or fully, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID plan and approved by the Department. Technical infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to: 
i.  The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite. 
ii.  Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within ten (10) feet of surface grade. 
iii.  Locations within one hundred (100) feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water. 
iv.  Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern. 
v.  Locations with potential geotechnical hazards. 
vi.  Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement. 
d.  Projects that have successfully demonstrated technical infeasibility for full retention of the SWQDv to the Department, shall implement alternate compliance measures (alternate mitigation options) as designated in the permit currently in effect at the time of development application submittal. 
e.  Additional alternative compliance options, such as offsite infiltration, may be available to the project. The project applicant should contact the Department to determine eligibility. Alternative compliance options are as further specified in the permit currently in effect at the time of development application submittal. 
f.  A multi-phased project shall comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by: 
i.  Designing a system acceptable to the Department to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire site during the first phase; and/or 
ii.  Implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of development or redevelopment of the project during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. 
iii.  For purposes of this subsection, "multi-phased project" shall mean any planning priority project implemented over more than one phase and the site of a multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the development or redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such development or redevelopment. 
g.  Minimize hydromodification impacts by maintaining the project's pre-development storm water runoff volumes, flow rates, and durations by maintaining the erosion potential (EP) in streams at 1, or implementing hydromodification control BMPs and/or LID strategies, or other restoration measures to meet hydromodification control criteria as designated in the permit currently in effect at the time of development application submittal. 
h.  Department may exempt certain applicable projects listed in subsection C of Section 13.20.020 from hydromodification control requirements where assessments of downstream channel conditions and proposed discharge hydrology indicate that adverse hydromodification effects to beneficial uses of natural drainage systems are unlikely: 
i.  The replacement, maintenance or repair of existing, publicly-maintained flood control facilities, storm drains, or transportation networks. 
ii.  Redevelopment of a previously developed site in an urbanized area that does not increase the effective impervious area or decrease the infiltration capacity of pervious areas compared to the pre-project conditions. 
iii.  Projects that have any increased discharge directly or via a storm drain to a sump, lake, area under tidal influence, into a waterway that has an estimated one-hundred-year peak flow of twenty-five thousand (25,000) cubic feet per second or more, or other receiving water that is not susceptible to hydromodification impacts. 
iv.  Projects that discharge directly or through a storm drain into concrete or other engineered (not natural) channels (e.g. channelized or armored rip rap, shotcrete, etc.) which, in turn, discharge into receiving water that is not susceptible to hydromodification impacts. 
v.  Single family homes that incorporate LID BMPs. 
F.  LID Plan Review. The applicant for any development project shall submit a LID plan to the Department for review and approval that provides a comprehensive, technical discussion of how the development project will comply with this Section 13.20.020. A deposit and fee to recover associated review costs shall be required. Timing for obtaining LID plan approval shall be as follows: 
a.  For subdivisions, the LID plan shall be approved prior to the tentative map. 
b.  For any development project requiring a conditional use permit (CUP) or other discretionary entitlement required under (City Code Section 16.38.010, General Purposes), the LID plan shall be approved prior to the issuance of any such CUP or other discretionary entitlement. 
c.  For all development projects, the LID plan shall be approved prior to issuance of a grading permit for the development project, or when no grading permit is required, prior to the issuance of a building permit. When no grading or building permit is required, LID plan approval shall be prior to the commencement of any development activity or as otherwise indicated in the non-discretionary land use approval. 
G.  Ongoing Maintenance. 
a.  All project's LID and hydromodification control features shall be maintained and shall remain operable at all times and shall not be removed from the project unless and until such features have been replaced with other LID and/or hydromodification control features in accordance with this section. 
b.  Unless excused by the Department, all LID plans shall include an operation and maintenance plan and monitoring plan for all LID practices, LID BMPs and hydromodification control features incorporated into the project. 
c.  The owner of the subject development project site shall record a covenant or agreement, approved by the Department, in the office of the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk indicating that the owner of the subject development project site is aware of and agrees to the requirements in this subsection. The covenant or agreement shall also include a diagram of the development project site indicating the location and type of each LID and hydromodification control feature incorporated into the development project. The time to record such convenient or agreement shall be as follows: 
i.  For any subdivision, prior to final map approval.

15.07.060 - Processing. 
The requirements and procedures for the processing of an art in public places application shall be as follows:

B.  The project applicant shall submit to the Planning Division a completed art in public places application form in a timely manner as set forth under the city guidelines. 
C.  The Planning Division shall, upon receipt of the application, submit the application to the Art Coordinator. The Art Coordinator shall review each project applicant's initial art work proposal; work with each project applicant to modify and/or refine each art work proposal to ensure its conformity with the city guidelines and to maximize its aesthetic compatibility with its anticipated surroundings; and make recommendations on each art work application based on his or her determinations. The Art Coordinator, in consultation with Economic Development staff, shall also ascertain the required value of the art work and the required amount of in-lieu fees in the event the project applicant elects to pay such fees as an alternative to the installation of art work. 
D.  Within sixty (60) days from the date the application is submitted to the Art Coordinator, the Art Coordinator shall submit to the Advisory Committee a written proposal based on the Art Coordinator's investigation and determinations and his or her consultations with the project applicant. 
E.  Within thirty (30) days from the date upon which the Advisory Committee receives a recommended proposal from the Art Coordinator, the Advisory Committee shall review and comment upon the recommendation and in its sole and absolute discretion, formulate and make a recommendation of its own to the City Council. The Advisory Committee's failure to make a recommendation to the City Council within the time allotted shall result in the Art Coordinator's recommendation becoming the recommendation of the Advisory Committee. 
F.  The City Council shall either approve the art work proposal as recommended by the Advisory Committee; approve the art work proposal subject to additional modifications and/or conditions acceptable to the project applicant; or deny the art work proposal. All City Council approvals shall be final. 
If the City Council denies an initial art work proposal, the project applicant, within thirty (30) days of the denial, shall submit a written notice to the City Clerk indicating that the project applicant has elected: (1) to have the art work proposal reconsidered at the Advisory Committee level so that the Advisory Committee in consultation with the Art Coordinator and the project applicant may develop and submit a revised and reformulated proposal for City Council approval within thirty (30) days from the filing date of the project applicant's written request; or (2) to contribute appropriate funds into the art in public places fund in lieu of installing art work. Subject to the restrictions of subsection G of this section, a project applicant may make successive written requests to have a denied proposals reconsidered at the Advisory Committee level until a proposal acceptable to the City Council is developed. All written requests to have a revised proposal reconsidered at the Advisory Committee level shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date of a denial. 
The City Council reserves the right to approve a revised and reformulated art work proposal as proposed; approve a revised and reformulated art work proposal subject to additional modifications and/or conditions acceptable to the project applicant; or deny such revised and reformulated proposals. Subject to the restrictions of subsection G of this section, denials of initial art work proposals or revised and reformulated art work proposals shall be final if the project applicant subsequently elects to contribute to the art in public places fund in lieu of installing art work; or upon the project applicant's failure to timely request that a denied proposal be reconsidered at the Advisory Committee level. 
G.  When the project applicant has elected to acquire and install an art work, no building permit may be issued until the City Council has approved an art work proposal, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the approved art work has been installed. 
H.  In the event the City Council has approved an art work proposal but the art work itself cannot be completed before the completion of the overall private project, the project applicant may request that a certificate of occupancy be issued absent installation of the art work, provided the project application first submits to the El Monte Economic Development Department a cashier's check in an amount equivalent to the required value of the art work. The Economic Development Department shall hold the funds in trust until the art work is completed, permanently installed and inspected for compliance with this chapter. As an additional condition to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy pursuant to this subsection, the project applicant shall be required to execute a three (3) party written agreement between the project applicant, the proposed artist and the city of El Monte regarding the artist's payment plan, using the funds held in trust by the Economic Development Department. The agreement shall provide that the city will be authorized to determine the final location of the art work, should there be any complications over the arrangement. Should the art work not be installed after six (6) months from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the city shall control the decision-making regarding the funds in trust and completion of the public art work. Any project applicant who is issued a certificate of occupancy pursuant to this subsection, must install the approved art work no later than six (6) months from the date the certificate of occupancy is issued. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the city from denying a certificate of occupancy pursuant to provisions of the El Monte Municipal Code and/or state law unrelated to the subject matter of this chapter. 
I.  If the project applicant has elected to make an in-lieu contribution to the art in public places fund, no building permits shall be issued until such contribution has been paid.

The application shall be made in writing and filed with the Public Works Director prior to the issuance of a building permit authorizing construction of the project that is subject to the fee. The application shall state completely and in detail the applicant's factual basis, supported by studies or reports for a fee waiver. 
1.  The applicant may elect to pay the full fee under protest at the time of the submittal of the fee waiver application in order to obtain a building permit in advance of the determination of the fee waiver application.

2.  The Public Works Director shall consider the application and respond in writing setting forth the reasons for approval, denial, or request for additional information within sixty (60) days. The decision of the Public Works Director is appealable pursuant to subsection G of Section 15.08.010. 
3.  The application process under this section is limited in scope to applications for fee waivers based on the absence of any impact of development on city facilities and services. The application process for a development fee waiver under the specific facts of a particular development project site pursuant to this section is not applicable to a fee protest under Government Code Section 66020 et seq.

15.34.054 - Administrative fines and penalties. 
A.  Purpose. 
1.  This Section 15.34.054 authorizes the imposition of administrative fines or any person who violates any provision of this Chapter 15.34 in order to encourage and obtain compliance with the provisions of this Chapter 15.34 for the benefit and protection of the entire community. This section governs the imposition, enforcement, collection and administrative review of all administrative fines related to: the possession, use, storage, sale and/or display of those fireworks classified as "dangerous fireworks" in Health and Safety Code Section 12500 et seq. with the exception of a pyrotechnic licensee when operating pursuant to that license; and the use of "safe and sane fireworks" as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 12550 et seq. on or at the dates, times and/or locations other than those permitted by this chapter. Said administrative fines are imposed under the authority of Government Code Section 53069.4, Health and Safety Code Section 12557, and the city's police power. 
2.  The issuance of citations imposing administrative fines may be performed at the discretion of the officials of the city authorized hereunder; and the issuance of a citation to any person constitutes but one remedy available to the city to redress violations of this Chapter 15.34 by any person. By adopting this Section 15.34.054, the city does not intend to limit its authority to employ any other remedy, civil or criminal, to redress any violations of this code by any person, which the city may otherwise pursue. 
3.  The imposition of fines related to "dangerous fireworks" under this Chapter 15.34 shall be limited to persons who possess, sell, use and/or display, or the seizure of twenty-five (25) pounds or less (gross weight) of such "dangerous fireworks." 
4.  Fines collected pursuant to this Chapter 15.34 related to "dangerous fireworks" shall not be subject to Health and Safety Code Section 12706, which section provides that certain fines collected by a court of the state be deposited with, and disbursed by the County Treasurer. However, the city shall provide cost reimbursement to the State Fire Marshal pursuant to regulations to be adopted by the State Fire Marshal addressing the State Fire Marshal's cost for the transportation and disposal of "dangerous fireworks" seized by the city, which costs will be part of any administrative fine imposed. Unless and until said regulations have been adopted by the state of California, the city shall hold in trust two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or twenty-five (25) percent of any fine collected, which ever is greater, to cover the cost reimbursement to the State Fire Marshal for said cost of transportation and disposal of the "dangerous fireworks." 
5.  Every person who applies for and receives a "block party permit" in accordance with Chapter 12.07 or other applicable code provision, or similar license or approval required by the city to close a street or otherwise reserve or use a piece of city property shall comply with all conditions imposed upon the issuance of such permit, license or approval, including but not limited to taking all reasonable efforts necessary to ensure that "dangerous fireworks" are not used at said event. A violation of this condition of such permit, license or approval shall be subject to a separate administrative fine under the provisions of this Chapter 15.34. Likewise, any person who fails to obtain any "block party permit", license or other such approval from the city, in accordance with Chapter 12.07 or other applicable provision of the code, when such person is so required by the code shall be subject to a separate administrative fine under this Chapter 15.34 as well as an additional administrative fine if "dangerous fireworks" are used at and during said event. 
6.  Because of the serious threat of fire or injury posed by the use of "dangerous fireworks" that can result from persistent or repeated failures to comply with the provisions of this code and the effect of such conditions or activities on the safety and the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and to the public health, safety and welfare, this Chapter 15.34 imposes strict civil liability upon the owners of residential real property for all violations of this code existing on their residential real property. Each contiguous use, display and/or possession shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to a separate administrative fine. 
B.  Issuance of Administrative CitationsContents. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided under this Chapter 15.34, the procedures contesting the issuance of an administrative citation pursuant to this Chapter 15.34 shall be those procedures set forth under Sections 1.18.060 through 1.18.090 of Chapter 1.18 of the El Monte Municipal Code. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Chapter 15.34 and the provisions of Section 1.18.060 through 1.18.090 of Chapter 1.18, the provisions of this Chapter 15.34 shall govern and control but only to the extent of the conflict and no further. 
2.  Whenever a Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) determines that a violation of the code has occurred, the CEO may issue an administrative citation on a city- approved form listing the code violation(s) and the amount of the administrative fine required to be paid by the responsible person(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter 15.34. 
3.  Furthermore, an administrative fine or fines may be imposed on any person for failure to comply with any condition or requirement imposed on any "block party permit," license and/or approval issued under or pursuant to Chapter 12.07 or other applicable EMMC provision. 
4.  Each administrative citation shall contain the following provisions:

b.  The address or description of the location of the violation;

d.  The section or sections of this code that were violated; 
e.  A description of the violations(s); 
f.

g.  Notice of the procedure to request an administrative hearing to contest the citation (including the form to be used, how to obtain the form, and the period within which the request must be made in order for it to considered timely); 
h.  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of any witnesses to the violations(s); 
i.  The name and signature of the CEO who issued the citation and the name and signature of the citee, if he or she is physically present and will sign the citation at the time of issuance. The refusal of a citee to sign a citation shall not affect its validity or any related subsequent proceedings, nor shall signing a citation constitute an admission that a person is responsible for a violation of the code; 
j.  Any other information deemed necessary by the Director for enforcement or collection purposes. 
C.  Administrative Fines.

The developer shall be guided by the principles of erosion prevention described in the following subdivisions or by any other acceptable principles or practices. 
1.  The erosion and sedimentation control plan should be fitted to the topography and soil class so as to create the least potential for soil loss. Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize inevitable soil loss through land disturbing activity, such as: 
a.  Natural vegetation should be retained wherever possible; 
b.  Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary vegetation or mulching should be installed promptly to minimize inevitable soil loss and to ensure that soil losses are kept below the tolerable limits; 
c.  Erosion control elements shall be implemented as soon as practical in the development process, except that the time elapsed shall not exceed sixty (60) days after the cessation, termination or completion of grading, whichever comes first. 
2.  Exposure of the soil through land disturbing activity should be held to the smallest practicable area and to the shortest practicable period of time consistent with maximum tolerable soil loss levels. 
3.  Appropriate provision should be made to accommodate increased storm water runoff and consequent soil loss occasioned by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. In addition to the use of vegetation and limitations on soil exposure as prescribed herein, such provisions may include but are not limited to: 
a.  Installing and maintaining sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps to substantially reduce sediment from runoff water. 
C.  Whenever an erosion and sedimentation control permit is required, a security deposit in the per the current Engineering Department fee schedule shall be required to guarantee that provisions of the permit are met. Any measures which are temporary and portable, such as sand bags and Visqueen, may be deposited so as to not interfere with normal construction activity during dry weather. However, any necessary measures shown on the approved plan shall be in place during any storm event. 
1.  If those erosion control measures shown on the plan are not in place within twenty-four (24) hours of the prediction of a storm event by the U.S. Weather Service, the City Engineer may have such measures installed and charge any costs thereof against the security deposit. 
2.  If any sedimentation does collect in the public right-of-way, it shall be cleaned up within twenty-four (24) hours of the end of each storm event. Failure to do so may permit the City Engineer to have the street cleaned and charge any costs thereof against the security deposit.

C.  If the permit is allowed to expire pursuant to Section 15.40.100, the inspection fee shall be refunded, less any direct costs incurred by the city. 
D.  If all improvements approved under the grading permit, including all public improvements, are not completed by the date shown on the valid grading permit, then an additional inspection fee, equal to the actual cost to the city, shall be required. The amount of such additional fees shall be deducted from the security deposit. 
(Ord. No. 2933, § 2, 8-21-2018)

A.  General Requirement. Any business establishment that uses carts in its operations, or that provides, or otherwise makes available carts for use by its customers, shall be required to employ and/or install physical containment devices and/or equipment designed to prevent the unauthorized removal of such carts from premises where they are located. 
B.  Containment Options. In the furtherance of subsection A of this section, each business establishment shall be required to employ and/or install one or more of the following physical containment measures: 
1.  Equipping all carts with a wheel locking or stopping mechanism used in conjunction with an electronic or magnetic barrier running along or within the perimeter of the premises. Such wheel locking or stopping mechanism must activate when the shopping cart crosses the electronic or magnetic barrier; 
2.  Equipping all carts with devices and/or equipment which physically prevents the carts from being removed from the interior of any building or structure in which they are used; 
3.  Installing physical barriers within all buildings or structures which physically prevent carts from being removed from the interior of any building or structure in which they are used; 
4.  Installing a physical barrier system designed to reliably prevent the removal of carts from the territorial boundaries of the premises, provided, however, that such barrier system be designed to be architecturally and aesthetically consistent and compatible with other on premise improvements. 
Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the El Monte Planning Commission, or the El Monte City Council on appeal, from requiring one or more of the containment measures enumerated above, or any other physical containment measures which are not so enumerated, as mitigating conditions for the approval of any discretionary land use authorization (e.g., conditional use permits, modifications, variances, design review approvals, subdivision maps, parcel maps and the like). 
C.  Approval by Planning Services Manager. Commencing upon the effective date of this section, below, every new or existing business establishment must either: (i) submit documentation which to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Services Manager proves that the business establishment has installed any one or more of the measures set forth under subsections (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this section and that such system is operational and in good working condition; or (ii) submit to the Planning Services Manager a proposal for the installation and construction of a barrier system as contemplated under subsection (B)(4) of this section. The Planning Services Manager shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of submission to review any proposal for a barrier system contemplated under subsection (B)(4) of this section and may thereafter approve the proposal as proposed; deny the proposal as proposed; or approve the proposal subject to modifications and amendments aimed at enhancing its cart containment reliability and/or its architectural and aesthetic consistency with other on-premises improvements to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Services Manager. No new business establishment shall be issued a certificate of occupancy until the requirements of this section are satisfied. No existing business shall be issued a business permit as contemplated under Chapter 5.25 (Use of Shopping and Laundry Carts) of this Code until the requirements of this section are satisfied. 
D.  Implementation of Supplemental Measures. In addition to the physical containment option set forth under subsection (B)(4) of this section, the Permit Committee may require the employment and/or installation of any one of the options set forth under subsections (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this section, if the Permit Committee finds that the option set forth under subsection (B)(4) does not reliably prevent the removal of carts from the premises. If the number of carts removed from the premises, or otherwise found abandoned, exceeds eight (8) carts per month during any ten (10) months of the calendar year following the installation of the containment measure contemplated under subsection (B)(4) of this section, such containment measure shall not be considered reliable for purposes of this subsection. The Permit Committee may direct the employment and/or installation of the additional measures in the course of any renewal of a business permit or in the course of any revocation proceedings as both processes are set forth under Chapter 5.25 of this Code. 
E.  Compliance Period.

17.08.100 - Reduction of required spaces. 
A.  The alternating use of parking facilities may be approved in cases where parties wish to cooperatively establish and operate parking facilities and where these uses generate parking demands primarily during hours when the remaining uses are not in operation (for example, if one use operates during the daytime or on weekends and the other use operates during the evenings or weekdays only). The burden of proof for a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces, however, shall remain with the applicant, and documentation shall be submitted substantiating the reasons for these requested parking reductions. An alternating use agreement may be approved by the City Planning Commission upon finding that such a reduction is appropriate and only under the following circumstances: 
1.  That a sufficient number of spaces shall be provided to meet the greatest parking demand of the alternating uses; 
2.  That satisfactory statements have been submitted by the parties operating such facilities, describing the nature of the uses and times when such uses operate so as to indicate the lack of conflict between them; 
3.  That additional documents or agreements as may be deemed necessary in each particular case to assure provision for and the maintenance of the required parking spaces have been provided; and 
4.  That a deed restriction is placed upon the property specifying permitted uses and other restrictions as deemed appropriate. 
B.  Parking requirements for a secondary use within the same building as the primary use (for example, a restaurant in a hotel or a shop within a sport facility) may be reduced by up to one-half, upon the determination by the Planning Division that such a reduction is justified. 
C.  The City Planning Commission may reduce the number of parking spaces required for senior housing by up to fifty (50) percent based upon a finding that the proposed development is located in proximity to commercial activities and services, and is adequately served by public transportation systems. 
D.  The City Planning Commission may permit up to one-half of the required parking spaces to be uncovered for dwelling units provided exclusively for low- and moderate-income and senior citizen households. 
E.  The City Planning Commission, based upon a finding that such is appropriate, may count city-owned public parking facilities within one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet of a use, measured from the use's nearest public access to such parking, in waiving all or part of the parking requirements if the sum of the required parking for such facilities is less than the existing parking provided.

Chapter 17.11 - WATER EFFICIENCY 
Sections: 
 
17.11.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  The state legislature has found that: 
(1)  The waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands; 
(2)  The continuation of California's economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses; 
(3)  It is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource; 
(4)  Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development; and 
(5)  Landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient; and 
(6)  Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use. 
(b)  Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this model ordinance is to: 
(1)  Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water; 
(2)  Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible; 
(3)  Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes; 
(4)  Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount; 
(5)  Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies; 
(6)  Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and 
(7)  Encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance or its local landscape ordinance. 
(c)  Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California's environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the Ordinance, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by: 
(1)  Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits. 
(2)  Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas. 
(3)  Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment. 
(4)  Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion. 
(5)  Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action.

Chapter 17.12 - SIGN STANDARDS AND SIGNAGE REGULATION[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2831, § 4, adopted Sept. 24, 2013, changed the title of Ch. 17.12 from "Signs Standards" to "Sign Standards and Signage Regulations." 
 
17.12.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish sign regulations that are intended to: 
A.  Aid the public's orientation and to advertise and identify business and activities; 
B.  Promote the appearance of the city as an attractive place to live, work, and trade by controlling and regulating the design, quality of materials, location, scale, illumination, and maintenance of signs; and 
C.  Provide minimum standards designed to safeguard the health, safety, and public welfare while encouraging flexibility, variety and compatibility. 
D.  Regulate signs in a constitutional manner that is content neutral as to messages which are within the protections of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and corollary provisions of the California Constitution. 
(Zoning ordinance § 17.12.010) 
(Ord. No. 2831, § 5, 9-24-2013)  
17.12.020 - General provisions and requirements. 
A.  The provisions contained within this chapter shall apply to the placement of signs on private property, the public thoroughfare and city property. The foregoing notwithstanding, provisions of this chapter regulating signage, other than temporary signs and inanimate signs, shall not apply to private property located within the so-called "Downtown El Monte Retail Core" as the same is defined under Chapter 17.72 (Downtown El Monte Retail Core Face Design Standards). 
B.  It is unlawful for any person, entity or corporation to affix, install, construct, reconstruct, display, alter or relocate any sign without first complying with the requirements of this chapter. Any person, entity or corporation affixing, installing, constructing, reconstructing, displaying, altering or relocating any sign not in compliance with this chapter shall be subject to the remedies contained in Chapter 17.06 and/or the remedies contained within this chapter. 
C.  All signs shall be professionally painted, lettered and installed and maintained in good condition at all times including the replacement of damaged or broken letters, faded colors, or missing lights from illuminated signs. 
D.  Signs shall be architecturally integrated into the overall building design and harmonious with the materials, color, texture, scale, size, shape, height, placement, and design of the building, property, and neighborhood of which it is a part. 
E.  Exterior or exposed raceway or conduit is prohibited. 
F.  Unshielded light bulbs in excess of twenty-five (25) watts per lamp which may be seen from the public street or any property line shall not be used in conjunction with any sign, except neon signs. 
G.  No sign may be designated, lighted, placed or displayed that would in any way simulate any type of traffic, emergency vehicle or emergency control or direction device or create a situation which is determined to be a traffic hazard by the City Engineer. 
H.  Every building must have a street number in arabic numerals at a size of six (6) inches and be readily visible from the street. Numbers any larger may be considered a sign. 
I.  Unless otherwise specified, a sign containing text or graphic material which can be viewed from not more than two (2) surfaces of a single structure shall be considered a single sign; provided that the maximum distance between the two viewing surfaces shall not exceed four (4) feet at any point. 
J.  With respect to private property located in the Downtown El Monte Retail Core as referenced under Chapter 17.72 (Downtown El Monte Retail Core Façade Design Standards) of the El Monte Municipal Code, only one commercial temporary sign shall be permitted on each exterior wall or window of a premises which abuts a street, alley, exit court, or public parking area indicating that a sale of goods or services is being conducted on said premises, provided that said sign does not exceed ten (10) square feet in area; its letters, numbers, or symbols do not exceed twelve (12) inches in height; and no such sign is maintained for more than thirty (30) days in any consecutive one-hundred-eighty-day period.

3.  No fine or other penalty shall be imposed for any first offense which occurs during the period of time commencing forty-five (45) days prior to the date of an Election and ending forty-eight (48) hours after the date of an Election (hereinafter, "expanded posting period"). 
4.  During each expanded posting period, the first single batch of noncommercial temporary signs belonging to a particular person, candidate, campaign committee or organization (hereinafter, a "responsible party") that have been removed by the city shall collectively constitute the first violation for the responsible party. The City Manager or designee shall attempt to contact the responsible party that owns the subject signs based on information reasonably available and accessible to the City Manager or designee so that the signs may be retrieved. The foregoing notwithstanding, as a condition precedent to the release of the offending signs, the responsible party or an agent or representative of the responsible party who is duly authorized to bind the same contractually and act on the responsible party's behalf shall be required to execute an affidavit on a form prepared by the city declaring under penalty of perjury that (i) the released signs do in fact belong to the responsible party; (ii) the responsible party understands the nature of the violation; and (iii) the responsible party shall advise and instruct all persons working on behalf of the candidate, campaign committee, organization or entity on the proper placement of noncommercial temporary signs within the city. If a responsible party fails to retrieve any removed signs or declines to sign the affidavit within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of notification, the signs shall be deemed discarded and the City Clerk may dispose of the signs in any manner deemed by the City Clerk to be convenient or desirable. 
5.  If, during the same expanded posting period and following the execution of the affidavit referenced, above, additional noncommercial temporary signs are displayed, posted, placed or affixed in violation Section 17.12.110 A.1 of this chapter for a particular responsible party, the second single batch of signs belonging to the responsible party and removed by the city shall count as a second violation. The City Clerk shall contact the responsible party but will only release the removed signs on condition that the responsible party first reimburse the city for the cost of removing the signs, inclusive of staff time, the use of special equipment and other reasonable costs associated with removal. If the reimbursement costs are not paid within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of notification, the signs shall be deemed discarded and the City Clerk may dispose of the signs in any manner deemed by the City Clerk to be convenient or desirable. 
6.  If, during the same expanded posting period and following the occurrence of a first and second violation of Section 17.12.110 A.1 of this chapter, addition noncommercial temporary signs for a responsible party are again displayed, posted, placed or affixed in violation of Section 17.12.110 A.1, then the city may prosecute the violation in accordance with the enforcement procedures of Chapter 1.18 (Administrative Citations) or Chapter 1.24 (General Penalty). The foregoing notwithstanding, every fifty (50) signs belonging to a particular responsible party which are displayed, placed, posted or affixed in violation of Section 17.12.110 A.1 and removed by the city shall constitute a single violation. In prosecuting such violations the city may pursue any and all remedies available to it at law, including fines, penalties and the reimbursement of actual costs associated with the removal of offending signs. 
7.  If, any noncommercial temporary sign is displayed, placed, posted or affixed in violation of Section 17.12.110 A.1 during any period of time other than an expanded posting period, such violations shall be prosecuted in the same manner as any other violation involving the posting of signs in the public thoroughfare or on city property. 
8.  For purposes of this subsection and in the absence of any other identifying information in a noncommercial temporary sign, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that noncommercial temporary signs in support of a specific candidate for elected office are owned jointly by the candidate and the candidate's campaign committee. If a candidate or candidate committee that provides substantial evidence in support of the assertion that the candidate or candidate committee is not the owner of a sign, signs removed by the city shall not be released to the candidate or candidate committee.

A.  At least once per calendar year, the city shall conduct a voluntary temporary sign placement orientation, advising stakeholders, including but not limited to nightclub promoters, candidates for elected office and/or commercial expo promoters, of the laws and regulations applicable to temporary signs in the city. 
B.  Attendance at the city's temporary sign orientation shall not constitute a condition precedent to the posting of signs in the city or other exercise of constitutionally protected speech, but a lack of knowledge of the city's sign regulations shall not serve as a defense to any violation of this chapter.

"Nonconforming building or structure" means a building or structure which was lawful when brought into existence, but because of subsequent amendment to this chapter, or annexation into the city, could not be built because of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, setbacks, parking, design requirements, location on a lot, type or construction, or other similar requirements concerning the structure. 
"Nonconforming land" means a use which was lawful when brought into existence, but by reason of subsequent amendment to this chapter, or annexation into the city, no longer conforms to the requirements for the district in which it is located.

B.  Whenever a building or structure which is deemed to be nonconforming by virtue of this chapter is damaged to an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost immediately prior to such damage, the structure may be restored to its state prior to such damage, provided the restoration is started within one hundred eighty (180) days and diligently pursued to completion. This replacement cost shall be determined by the chief building official, whose decision may be appealed to the City Council. Except as specified in Section 17.14.070, buildings or structures that are damaged greater than fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost shall conform to all current provisions of this title.

17.14.070 - Nonconformity resulting from change in residential density regulations. 
If a residential use is deemed nonconforming solely by virtue of its exceeding the allowable dwelling unit density of the parcel of land on which it is located, such residential use may, if destroyed or damaged greater than fifty (50) percent of its replacement costs through natural causes, be rebuilt to the original legal density subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Design review approval is granted by the City Planning Commission.

A.  The right to continue a nonconforming use shall terminate when it is determined to be a public nuisance by order of the independent Hearing Officer pursuant to procedures provided in Chapter 8.44 of this Code or order of a court of competent jurisdiction and the nuisance is not abated in the manner and within the time stated in the order of the Hearing Officer or the order of the court. In addition to the specific grounds for finding a nuisance as set forth in Chapter 8.44 of this Code, a nonconforming use is a public nuisance if: 
1.  The use interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property in the neighborhood; or 
2.  The use is a business establishment which permits persons to congregate for unreasonably long time periods in parking areas and/or pedestrian walkways resulting in unreasonable noise levels in residential areas during the hours of nine p.m. to seven a.m., or resulting in said persons obstructing or interfering with the free passageway in said parking areas or on said pedestrian walkways, or which becomes a place where an unreasonable number of violations of Chapter 9.12 of this Code (relating to public consumption of alcoholic beverages) or violations of alcoholic beverage control regulations occur; or 
3.  The use is injurious to the health of persons in the neighborhood. 
B.  The right to continue the use of a nonconforming structure shall terminate when the structure and/or the parcel on which it is located is determined to be a public nuisance by order of the Hearing Officer made pursuant to Chapter 8.44 of this Code, or by judgment or order of a court of competent jurisdiction and the nuisance is not abated in the manner and within the time stated in the order of the Hearing Officer or order of the court. If the abatement of the nuisance required demolition of the structure the order, judgment or order of the court shall find that in fairness and in justice there is no other way reasonably to correct the nuisances other than by demolition of the structure. 
C.  Where it cannot be found that demolition of a structure is appropriate, the Hearing Officer shall permit the structure to remain in existence, but may impose one or more conditions to bring the structure into conformity with the requirements of this title so far as is reasonable in addition to any other conditions necessary to abate the public nuisance.

G.  In determining whether to grant an extension of the amortization period, and in determining the appropriate length of such an extension, the Planning Commission and, the City Council on appeal, shall consider: 
1.  The amount of investment in the business; 
2.  The present actual and depreciated value of business improvements; 
3.  The applicable Internal Revenue Service depreciation schedule or functional non-confidential equivalent; 
4.  The remaining useful life of the business improvements;

17.14.110 - Parking and expansion or remodeling of structure, or change in use. 
A.  When the use of a structure changes to a use that is required to have the same number of parking spaces as the immediately previous use, no additional parking spaces shall be required for the new use, regardless of the number of spaces actually provided by the previous use; provided that the previous use was legally established and the number of spaces has not decreased. For example, for a new restaurant going into a site where a previous restaurant existed. The new restaurant requires twenty (20) spaces but the old restaurant only had ten (10) spaces. The new restaurant can open with only ten (10) spaces. 
B.  When the floor area of an existing use is increased, additional parking spaces shall be provided on-site as required by this chapter only for the additional gross floor area. This applies to expansions that are a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the original floor area. Any expansion greater than fifty (50) percent requires the use to conform to current parking standards. For example, if a restaurant expands its floor area by five hundred (500) sq. ft., then they would need to provide additional parking for the five hundred (500) sq. ft., no matter how many spaces existed for the original structure. 
C.  Parking allowance for transitional uses, pursuant to Section 17.24.040, and subject to the approval of a conditional use permit. Transitional uses are permitted a twenty-five (25) percent parking reduction over the required number of spaces for the transitional use. A twenty-six (26) to fifty (50) percent reduction can be approved by the Planning Commission if substantiated by a parking study. Options for allowing this reduction include, but are not limited to, tandem parking, shared off-site parking, limitation of transitional uses to low impact uses, limitation of hours of operation, partial demolition of existing building and any other method that can be substantiated by a parking study prepared by a licensed traffic engineer or transportation professional. 
D.  When a new trash enclosure is required the applicant must seek all feasible locations before considering removing required on-site parking to accommodate the new trash enclosure. 
E.  Nonconforming parking or loading. An existing use of land shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use simply because of the lack of off-street parking or loading facilities required by Chapter 17.08. However, a structure with nonconforming parking that increases the number of parking or loading spaces shall not thereafter reduce that number of spaces unless the number of spaces after the reduction complies with the minimum requirements of Chapter 17.08. 
(Ord. No. 2883, § 27, 6-21-2016) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2883, § 27, adopted June 21, 2016, set out provisions intended for use as § 17.14.090. To avoid duplication of section numbers and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as § 17.14.110.

Sections: 
 
17.16.010 - Certificate of occupancy; temporary certificate of occupancy. 
A.  Certificate of Occupancy. No person shall occupy or otherwise use, or permit the occupancy or use of all or any portion of the following until a certificate of occupancy is applied for and then issued by the Building Official: 
1.  Any building, structure or other improvement constructed upon all or any portion of real property; 
2.  Any building, structure or other improvement that has been altered, added to, enlarged or moved upon all or any portion of real property; 
3.  Any real property, building, structure or other improvement that has been sold, exchanged, transferred or otherwise conveyed, excluding the sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of any multi-family residential building containing five (5) or more residential dwelling units. (The property inspection report provisions of Section 17.16.060 shall also apply in the case of certain sales, exchanges, transfers and conveyances identified under that section); 
4.  All or any portion of any nonresidential building, structure or other improvement rented, leased, licensed or whose occupancy or reoccupancy is otherwise permitted by the owner or any agent of the owner;

B.  Building Permit Application. An application for a certificate of occupancy must be submitted concurrently with an application for a building permit. 
C.  General Property Inspection. Once a complete and accurate application for a certificate of occupancy is submitted to, and accepted by, the Building Division, an inspection date for the real property in question shall be scheduled and the applicant shall thereafter make the real property available for such inspection by the Building Official on the date scheduled. 
D.  Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued within ten (10) business days from the date the Building Official determines all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  A complete and accurate application for a certificate of occupancy is on file with the city of El Monte; 
2.  The real property complies with all discretionary land use authorizations affecting the real property; and all other real property related provisions of this Code, most notably the provisions of Title 15 (Building and Construction) and Title 17 (Zoning); 
3.  The real property in question complies with all other provisions, requirements and restrictions of this chapter; and 
4.  All violations and deficiencies identified in the course of the inspection have been corrected and approved by the Building Division. 
E.  Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. 
1.  Following the submission of a complete and accurate application for a certificate of occupancy but prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the Building Official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy if: 
a.  The Building Official determines the real property in question is in substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter and all other real property related provisions of this Code; 
b.  The applicant makes a clear and convincing showing of good faith efforts to timely complete the correction of all outstanding violations and deficiencies identified by the Building Official; and 
c.  The applicant posts a compliance bond with the city to guarantee the full and timely completion of all required corrections. The amount of the compliance bond shall be determined by the Building Official using such criteria and methodology as may be adopted, and from time to time revised and/or modified, by City Council resolution. 
2.  An applicant's failure to correct all deficiencies within the time period specified on the temporary certificate of occupancy shall constitute a violation of this chapter. No temporary certificate of occupancy shall set forth a time period for the completion of all corrections that is greater than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. A temporary certificate of occupancy shall automatically expire fourteen (14) calendar days from the date in which all outstanding corrections were to be completed or automatically upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Absent the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, no person may continue to occupy or otherwise use the real property that is the subject of a temporary certificate of occupancy upon the expiration of the temporary certificate of occupancy.

A.  Changes in Residential Tenancies. The issuance of a new certificate of occupancy shall not be required for a simple change in tenancies with respect to any lawful dwelling or dwelling unit leased or otherwise rented for residential purposes. 
B.  Transient Occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall not be required for the transient occupancy or reoccupancy of a legally permitted guest room within a legally permitted hotel, motel, motor hotel or inn as part of its normal course of business. In order to be considered "transient" under this section, each individual occupancy or reoccupancy of an individual guest room/unit must be for a period of less than thirty (30) consecutive days and no individual guest unit may be occupied or reoccupied by the same person for more than sixty (60) consecutive days total within any one hundred eighty (180) consecutive day period. 
(Ord. 2683 § 1 (part), 2007)  
17.16.030 - Vacant and unimproved real property. 
A.  An application for a certificate of occupancy must first be submitted and a certificate of occupancy issued by the Building Official before real property that is both vacant and unimproved may be occupied or used for any purpose. 
B.  Absent the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, real property that is both vacant and unimproved may only be used for the limited purpose of tilling soil and growing farm, garden or orchard products, provided such real property is lawfully zoned for such uses.

17.16.040 - Property inspection report upon sale or transfer of real property. 
A.  Property Inspection Report. The title owner of real property or the duly authorized agent of the real property owner shall also apply to the Building Division for the preparation of a property inspection report in the case of any sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of the real property in question. The property inspection report shall be prepared by the Building Official. 
B.  Exceptions. The requirements of this section shall not apply to the sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of any of the following: 
1.  Multifamily residential buildings containing five (5) or more residential dwelling units; 
2.  Real property that is both vacant and unimproved; or 
3.  Real property that will soon be made vacant and unimproved and thereafter remain vacant and unimproved for an indefinite period of time, provided the owner or owner's agent posts a demolition compliance bond and provided all demolition and debris removal is completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the date sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance, whichever the case may be. 
C.  Mixed-Use DevelopmentsRented Units. If all residential dwelling units within the residential portion of a mixed-use development are owned by a single owner with each such unit being rented, leased, licensed or otherwise made available for residential purposes by the single owner (e.g., as would be the case with a multi-unit apartment complex), the requirements of this section shall not apply if the residential portion of the mixed-use development consists of five (5) or more residential dwelling units. 
D.  Mixed-Use DevelopmentsOwned Units. If two (2) or more residential dwelling units within the residential portion of a mixed-use development are owned by different owners under an arrangement of separate ownership (e.g., as would be the case with a multi-unit condominium complex), the requirements of this section shall apply to the sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of any residential unit within the residential portion of the mixed-use development. 
E.  Demolition Compliance Bond. In the event of any sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of real property that will soon be made vacant and unimproved with the aim of leaving said real property in a vacant and unimproved state for an indefinite period of time, the owner or owner's agent shall be required to post a demolition compliance bond to guarantee the full and timely demolition of all buildings, structures and other improvements upon the real property. The amount of the demolition compliance bond shall be determined by the Building Officials utilizing such criteria and methodology as may be adopted, and from time to time revised and/or modified, by City Council resolution. Following the completion of such sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance as evidenced by close of escrow or the change in title, whichever is earlier in time, no person may continue to occupy or use the subject real property unless the Building Official issues a temporary certificate of occupancy which shall remain valid until the stated commencement of date of demolition activities. The Building Official may issue such a temporary certificate of occupancy using the issuance criteria set forth under subsection E of Section 17.16.010. Temporary certificates of occupancy issued pursuant to this subsection shall state the anticipated date upon which demolition will commence and shall expire upon the earlier of the following: (a) the date upon which demolition actually commences; or (b) the anticipated commencement date stated on the temporary certificate of occupancy. No temporary certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this subsection shall set forth an anticipated demolition commencement date that is more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. 
F.  Content of Property Inspection Report. The property inspection report shall contain the following information: 
1.  The street address and legal description of the subject real property; 
2.  The zone classification; 
3.  The legally authorized use of the subject real property; 
4.  As determined by the Planning Services Manager and/or the Building Official, the identification of all land use restrictions including, but not limited to, those imposed by way of variances, modifications, conditional use permits, subdivision maps, parcel maps and the like; 
5.  All corrections needed to bring the subject real property into compliance with provisions of this Code relating to building and construction standards; zoning requirements and restrictions; and housing restrictions; and 
All other corrections needed to correct any other condition constituting a violation of this Code, including, but not limited to, provisions relating to public health and safety. 
G.  Completion Period. Each property inspection report shall be completed within ten (10) city business days from the date the real property in question is inspected and shall remain valid for a period of six (6) months from the date of its issuance by the Building Official. If a property inspection report is not completed within the foregoing ten (10) day period, the requirements of this section shall be deemed waived. The foregoing notwithstanding, the waiver of the requirements of this section shall not constitute a waiver of any other requirements set forth under this chapter nor shall such waiver preclude the city from pursuing any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity in order to enforce the requirements and standards set forth under this Code. 
H.  Nonliability of City for Failure to Identify all Deficiencies. In issuing a property inspection report, neither the Building Official nor the Building Division warrant or represent that all outstanding code violations or deficiencies are stated therein. Violations and deficiencies identified in each property inspection report represent the Building Official's and Building Division's best attempt to identify all outstanding violations and deficiencies, but do not necessarily represent an exhaustive listing of such violations or deficiencies. The failure of the Building Official and/or the Building Division to identify a violation or deficiency in the property inspection report shall not prevent the city from taking all legal action available to it to cause such violation to be corrected, including, but not limited to, the issuance of criminal citations. 
I.  Nonliability of City for Failure to Identify Utility Charges. The failure of a property inspection report to identify delinquent utility charges for the subject real property shall not prevent the city from taking all legal action available to it to obtain payment of such charges. 
J.  Delivery of Report to Prospective Buyer. Each applicant shall deliver the property inspection report to the person attempting to acquire the subject real property (e.g., to the prospective buyer) and within fourteen (14) calendar days thereafter shall deliver to the Building Division a delivery confirmation receipt evidencing the successful delivery of the property inspection report. The delivery confirmation receipt form shall be provided to each applicant. 
K.  Time Period for Making Corrections to Property. If the subject real property is in need of corrections as specified in the property inspection report, the applicant shall initiate such corrections within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the property inspection report is issued and shall complete such corrections before a certificate of occupancy may be issued but in no event later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date the property inspection report is issued. 
L.  Parties Responsible for Corrections. The owner of real property that is the subject of a property inspection report shall be responsible for the completion of all needed corrections identified in the property inspection report. The person attempting to acquire the real property may assume legal responsibility for the completion of all corrections by execution and submission of an "Acknowledgement & Assumption Affidavit" coincident with the completion of the real property sale or exchange. The execution of an "Acknowledgement & Assumption Affidavit" notwithstanding, no new certificate of occupancy may be issued until all needed corrections are completed. 
M.  Compliance Bond. The execution of an "Acknowledgement & Assumption Affidavit" shall in turn require the posting by the buyer of a compliance bond with the city to guarantee the full and timely completion of all required corrections. The compliance bond shall be submitted at the same time as the submission of the "Acknowledgement & Assumption Affidavit" and no "Acknowledgement & Assumption Affidavit" shall be considered complete absent the posting of an adequate compliance bond. The amount of the compliance bond shall be determined by the Building Official using such criteria and methodology as may be adopted, and from time to time revised and/or modified, by City Council resolution. Following the Building Official's receipt of the posted compliance bond and pending the completion of all required corrections, the Building Official, in his or her discretion, may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy subject to the requirements of subsection E of Section 17.16.010 of this chapter in an effort to reasonably minimize any undue delay in the closing of escrow on the sale, exchange, transfer or conveyance of the subject real property. 
N.  Failure to Make Corrections. If any corrections prescribed in the property inspection report are not corrected within the time frame specified herein or within a temporary certificate of occupancy, such failure shall constitute a violation of this chapter and may be referred to the City Prosecutor for appropriate action.

Chapter 17.45 - MIXED/MULTIUSE ZONE 
 
17.45.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter to provide regulations that implement the goals and policies of the general plan and other similar long-range planning documents aimed at encouraging mixed-use development within the city. The mixed/multiuse zone is further intended to serve as an implementation tool of the city's housing element of the general plan by facilitating residential development on identified "housing opportunity sites." 
B.  The mixed/multiuse (MMU) zone has the following major objectives: 
1.  Create "by-right" opportunities for new mixed/multiuse housing along major corridors to protect and preserve single-family residential neighborhoods, reduce automobile dependence, improve air quality and revitalize and transition underutilized uses; 
2.  Implement state laws that require cities to demonstrate available land capacity and zoning tools to accommodate the city's projected need for housing; 
3.  Encourage lot assembly to provide quality multi-unit housing at higher densities; 
4.  Encourage commercial and mixed-use development at key intersections and nodes along major corridors and locate exclusively residential developments mid-block; 
5.  Create a pedestrian-oriented mix of uses with convenient access between area neighborhoods, housing, employment centers, and retail services; 
6.  Facilitate well-designed mixed/multiuse development projects that combine residential and nonresidential uses (e.g., office, retail, business services, personal services, public spaces and uses, other community amenities, etc.) vertically integrated (e.g., commercial frontage with residential and/or office uses above the first floor) or horizontally integrated (housing adjacent to commercial and office uses) to promote a better balance of jobs and housing; 
7.  Stimulate economic development and reinvestment through regulations based upon recognized urban design principles that allow property owners to respond with flexibility to market forces; and 
8.  Encourage the development of a unique zone character through a streetscape that provides attractive features (e.g., landscaping, niche or linear parks, public places, courtyards, etc.) designed to integrate the public realm (e.g., streets, sidewalks, etc.) with development on adjacent private property.

Usable open space shall not include any portion of parking areas, streets, driveways, sidewalks, or turnaround areas. 
B.  The following standards shall apply to the requirements for open space: 
1.  Private Residential Open Space. 
a.  For stand-alone multi-family residential projects or as part of a mixed-use development, each residential unit shall be provided with at least one area of private open space accessible directly from the living area of the unit, in the form of a fenced yard or patio, a deck or balcony at a minimum area of one hundred fifty (150) square feet per unit for first floor units and one hundred (100) square feet per unit for upper floors. 
b.  The minimum dimension, width or depth, of a balcony shall be five (5) feet. 
2.  Common Residential Open Space. 
a.  For stand-alone multi-family residential developments, each residential unit shall be provided with at least two hundred (200) square feet of common residential open space. 
b.  All common open space shall be conveniently located and accessible to all dwelling units on the site. 
c.  Common open space areas may include landscaping, pedestrian paths, and recreational facilities. 
d.  in projects containing fewer than ten (10) units, the common open space shall have a minimum width and depth of ten (10) feet. In projects containing ten (10) or more units, the minimum width and depth shall be twenty (20) feet. 
3.  Recreational Amenities/Facilities. 
a.  For projects containing twenty-five (25) or more residential units in stand-alone multi-family residential developments and as part of a mixed-use development, one common recreational amenity shall be provided for each twenty-five (25) units or fraction thereof. The following listed amenities satisfy the above recreational facilities requirements. Recognizing that certain facilities serve more people than others, have a wider interest or appeal, and/or occupy more area, specified items may be counted as two (2) amenities, as noted. In all cases, each square foot of land area devoted to a recreational amenity shall be credited as common open space on a 1:1 basis. 
i.  Clubhouse (two (2)). 
ii.  Swimming pool (two (2)). 
iii.  Tennis court (one per court). 
iv.  Basketball court (one per court).

(Ord. No. 2834, § 6(Exh. A), 1-14-2014)  
17.45.080 - Public space amenities requirements. 
A.  Each project proposed within the mixed/multiuse zone (MMU) must include a public open space amenity, or some form of physical interface for the pedestrian. Such features may include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Formal Plazas. A formal plaza would be a publicly accessible open space which has a design that is influenced by classical urban planning design. A formal plaza would typically include some sort of central water fountain and/or symmetrical landscaping. 
2.  Urban Gardens. An urban garden can be located on the ground level, or on upper levels of a structure. Urban gardens include ornamental landscaping arranged in raised or at-grade planters or planting areas, potted plants and trees. Many times there are sculptures or other forms of public art that are included within the urban garden. 
3.  Covered Colonnades. Colonnades are linear in design and generous in depth. The intent is to provide a comfortably wide, covered pathway that is adjacent to the openings of a building. Sometimes the second floor of a building is utilized to create the "covered" element of the colonnade. 
4.  Sidewalk Dining. Sidewalk dining may occur wherever a sidewalk space is ample enough to accommodate dining furniture without impeding pedestrian access of the sidewalk. Sidewalk dining may be defined with a railing or planters, or be open and accessible. 
5.  Pedestrian Alleys and Walkways. A pedestrian alley or walkway is typically a "lane" that does not follow the alignment of a vehicular street, but provides a pedestrian access to either a public space or some other feature within the interior of a development. Pedestrian alleys or walkways must be designed in such a manner so as to be inviting to pedestrians. Therefore, issues such as lighting, security, line of sight, cleanliness and visual appeal are important considerations to a well designed pedestrian alley or walkway. Sometimes public art, street furniture and access to shops and public spaces are features of pedestrian alleys and walkways.

H.  Signs. Signs shall comply with Chapter 17.12 (Sign Standards and Signage Regulation). In addition, in the MMU zone where both residential and nonresidential uses are allowed, the signage rights and responsibilities applicable to a particular use shall be determined as follows: residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in the residential area where that type of use would be allowed as a matter of right, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a discretionary process. 
I.  Sound mitigation. Residential dwelling units shall be designed to be sound attenuated against present and future project noise. New projects or new nonresidential uses in existing projects shall provide an acoustical analysis report, by an acoustical engineer, describing the acoustical design features of the structure required to satisfy the exterior and interior noise standards. 
J.  Design Criteria. 
1.  A mixed-use development project shall be designed and constructed to: 
a.  Be pedestrian in its focus by: 
i.  Providing direct pedestrian linkages to adjacent public sidewalks. 
ii.  Creating enhanced pedestrian connections throughout the project between residential and nonresidential uses and parking areas. 
iii.  Providing enhanced pedestrian amenities throughout the project, including seating, pedestrian area lighting, special paving, public art, water features, common open space, directories, and similar items to create a pleasant pedestrian experience. 
b.  Incorporating architectural design elements and materials that relate to a pedestrian scale. 
c.  Locate uses in proximity to one another without large intervening parking lots so that it is convenient for people to walk between the various uses and park their vehicles only once. 
d.  Create a pedestrian scale and character of development along the street by providing significant wall articulation and varying roof heights, incorporating pedestrian scale elements (e.g., doors, windows, lighting, landscaping), and locating storefronts and common open space areas (e.g., plaza, courtyard, outdoor dining) near the public sidewalk to contribute to an active street environment. 
2.  Consistent use of architectural details and materials. Architectural style and use of quality materials shall be compatible and consistent throughout an entire mixed-use project. However, differences in architectural details and materials may occur to differentiate between the residential and nonresidential portions of the project. The overall project design and site layout shall be one that promotes a strong pedestrian environment and active street frontage. This can be accomplished by incorporating features into the project as outlined in subsection 3, below. 
3.  Features. 
a.  Street Level Features. Variations in the front building plane shall be incorporated through the use of varying building setbacks, variations in wall planes, and the inclusion of pedestrian amenities (e.g., plaza, courtyard, outdoor dining, landscaping). Long expanses of blank walls shall be prohibited. 
b.  Pedestrian-Oriented Features. At least seventy-five (75) percent of the building frontage facing a public street, primary pedestrian way, or parking lot shall be devoted to pedestrian-oriented features (e.g., storefronts, pedestrian entrances to nonresidential uses; transparent display windows; landscaping). 
c.  Upper Level Features. Upper floor balconies, bays, and windows shall be provided whenever opportunities exist for these types of features. 
d.  Entrances. When nonresidential and residential uses are located in a vertical mixed use structure, separate pedestrian entrances shall be provided for each use. The entrances for nonresidential uses shall be designed to be visually distinct from the entrances for residential uses. Entrances to individual residential units in a vertical mixed use project shall not be allowed along a street frontage. Instead shared entrances to residential units located above the ground floor shall be from lobbies that serve multiple units. 
e.  Neighborhood Interface. The design of new infill development shall be sensitive to the scale and design characteristics of established structures in abutting residential neighborhoods, with the objective of achieving a harmonious transition between the new development and existing neighborhood. Consideration shall be given to factors including, but not limited to, orientation of architectural features, building articulation, and exterior building treatments. 
f.  Lighting. Lighting shall be incorporated along sidewalks or other pedestrian walkways, plazas, paseos, courtyards, and other common open areas to enhance the pedestrian environment and increase public safety. Lighting for nonresidential uses shall be designed, located, and shielded to ensure that they do not adversely impact the residential uses, but shall provide sufficient illumination for access and security purposes. 
g.  Security. Projects shall be designed to minimize security risks to residents and to minimize the opportunities for vandalism and theft. This may be accomplished by: 
i.  Maximizing visibility to common open space areas, internal walkways, and public sidewalks. Use opportunities for natural surveillance to increase visibility. 
ii.  Using walkways, low fences, lighting, signage, and landscaping to clearly guide people and vehicles to and from the proper entrances. 
iii.  Eliminating areas of concealment, hiding places, and dead spaces. 
iv.  Using lighting to improve the visibility of common areas while enhancing the pedestrian environment. Lighting should not be overly bright and should provide a uniform level of light over the subject area to eliminate dark spaces.

Chapter 17.79 - COLLECTION CONTAINERS 
Sections: 
 
17.79.010 - Purpose. 
The city has experienced a proliferation of collection containers and their placement in required parking spaces, required landscaped areas, and residential zoning districts of the city, often without the property owner's permission. The proliferation of these containers contribute to visual clutter; and in areas throughout the state, collection containers have contributed to blight due to graffiti and poor maintenance, and the accumulation of debris and excess items outside of the collection containers. They can also interfere with the proper collection of data concerning the diversion of waste within the city from landfills. The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, and/or welfare of the public and protect the property rights of the owners of the parcels on which the collection containers are located by providing minimum blight-related performance standards for the operation of collection containers, including establishing criteria to ensure that: 
A.  Material is not allowed to accumulate outside of the collection containers; 
B.  The collection containers remain free of graffiti and blight; 
C.  The collection containers are maintained in sanitary conditions; 
D.  The collection containers are not placed without the approval of property owners; 
E.  The collection containers are placed appropriately and in locations approved pursuant to this Code; and 
F.  Contact information is readily available so that the operators can be contacted if there are any blight-related questions or concerns, and that operators properly report information concerning the diversion of materials from landfills. This section regulates the size, number, placement, installation and maintenance of collection containers, as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing purposes. 
These content neutral regulations are also intended to respect and observe that collection containers provide a channel of communication deserving of First Amendment protection.

Chapter 17.80 - SP-1 (EL MONTE GATEWAY SPECIFIC PLAN)[5] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2780, § 3, adopted Nov. 15, 2011, changed the title of Ch. 17.80 from "SP-1 (Transit Village Specific Plan)" to "SP-1 (El Monte Gateway Specific Plan" and changed all references to "Transit Village" in this Code to "El Monte Gateway." 
 
17.80.010 - Adoption. 
A.  The City Council makes the following findings with respect to the adoption of the El Monte gateway specific plan: 
1.  The property proposed to be included in the specific plan area has site characteristics such as topography, location, or surroundings that are enhanced by special land use and development standards. The site has several unique characteristics. It is bounded by Santa Anita Avenue, Interstate 10, and the Rio Hondo Channel and is physically distinct from surrounding areas. There are no private residences or business that must be relocated. In addition, there is a major regional bus station at the center of the site. The site will support high-density, mixed-use, transit-oriented development that is not currently allowed in the El Monte Municipal Code. 
2.  The El Monte gateway specific plan contains revisions which are consistent with the goals, policies, and vision of the 1991 city general plan as amended by this chapter. The land use element of the general plan designates the specific plan site as an "urban core" use. With the concurrent adoption of a proposed general plan amendment addressing conforming development standards in the general plan to those contained in the specific plan, the specific plan is consistent with the general plan. 
3.  The implementation of the specific plan shall result in development of desirable character and use types that will be compatible with existing and proposed development in the surrounding neighborhood and that will promote higher rates of public mass transit utilization by city residents. The mixed-use nature of the specific plan area, including the location of street level retail and institutional uses on the west side of Santa Anita Avenue, is compatible with similar uses located on the east side of Santa Anita. 
4.  The implementation of the specific plan shall contribute to a balance of land uses throughout the city. Due to the mixed-use nature of the specific plan area, various uses, including residential, institutional, retail, commercial, entertainment, hotel, public open space, institutional, and public mass transit uses are incorporated into a master planned village environment, providing a balance on the site. 
5.

Chapter 17.81 - SP-4 (DOWNTOWN TRANSIT-ORIENTED DISTRICT SPECIFIC PLAN) 
 
17.81.010 - Adoption. 
A.  The City Council makes the following findings with respect to the adoption of the Downtown El Monte Transit-Oriented District Specific Plan: 
1.  The property proposed to be included in the specific plan area has site characteristics such as topography, location, or surroundings that are enhanced by special land use and development standards. The site has several unique characteristics. It is bounded by Santa Anita Avenue, Ramona Boulevard, and the Metrolink tracks and is physically distinct from surrounding areas. There are no private residences or business that must be relocated. In addition, there is a major regional bus station adjacent to the site on the west. The site will support high-density, mixed-use, transit-oriented development that is not currently allowed in the El Monte Municipal Code. 
2.  The Downtown El Monte Transit-Oriented District Specific Plan contains revisions which are consistent with the goals, policies, and vision of the 2011 City General Plan as amended by this chapter. The land use element of the general plan designates the specific plan site as a "Downtown Core" use. With the concurrent adoption of a proposed General Plan Amendment addressing conforming development standards in the general plan to those contained in the specific plan, the specific plan is consistent with the general plan. 
3.  The implementation of the specific plan shall result in development of desirable character and use types that will be compatible with existing and proposed development in the surrounding neighborhood and that will promote higher rates of public mass transit utilization by city residents. The mixed-use nature of the specific plan area, including the location of street level retail and multiple-family residential uses, is compatible with the regional bus facility and Metro tracks located in proximity to the specific plan area. 
4.  The implementation of the specific plan shall contribute to a balance of land uses throughout the city. Due to the mixed-use nature of the specific plan area, various uses, including residential, institutional, retail, commercial, entertainment, hotel, public open space, institutional, and public mass transit uses are incorporated into a master planned village environment, providing a balance of land uses in the area. 
5.  Furthermore, the adoption and implementation of the specific plan shall promote comprehensive planning for quality land development, with a viable program for building the infrastructure necessary to support it; it encourages more efficient use of the land; it encourages a range of housing and employment opportunities so as to give variety in the physical development pattern of the city; it encourages the implementation of sustainable community design principles as well as use of renewable construction materials and incorporation of environmentally friendly design concepts; and it facilitates development within the city in accordance with the general plan by permitting greater flexibility and encouraging more creative design development projects. 
B.  The City Council approves the El Monte Downtown Transit-Oriented Development Specific Plan in the form of the draft text of the specific plan as submitted to the City Council on April 4, 2017.

(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.050 - Application requirements. 
A.  Application Required. The approval authority shall not approve any request for a conditional use permit, administrative wireless permit or temporary wireless permit except upon a duly filed application consistent with this Section 17.82.050 and any other written rules the city or the Director may establish from time to time in any publicly-stated format. 
B.  Application Content. All applications for a conditional use permit, administrative wireless permit or temporary wireless permit must include all the information and materials required by the Director for the application. The City Council authorizes the Director to develop, publish and from time to time update or amend permit application requirements, forms, checklists, guidelines, informational handouts and other related materials that the Director finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing any application governed under this Chapter. The City Council further authorizes the Director to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the Director deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice. 
C.  Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. Any application for a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit will not be considered duly filed unless submitted in accordance with the procedures in this Section 17.82.050.C. 
1.  Pre-Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, the applicant must schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the Director for all proposed projects (a) subject to a conditional use permit or (b) that involve the deployment of more than five (5) facilities in the public right-of-way. Pre-submittal conferences for all other proposed projects are strongly encouraged but not required. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and review process, any latent issues in connection with the proposed or existing wireless tower or base station, including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination with other city departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that city staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Planning Division or Public Works Department, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the city for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-submittal conference. 
2.  Submittal Appointment. All applications must be submitted to the city at a pre-scheduled appointment with the Director. Applicants may submit up to ten (10) applications per appointment whenever feasible for city staff and not prejudicial to other applicants. The Director shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after the Director receives a written request and, if applicable, confirms that the applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person, by mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the Director at a pre-submittal conference. 
D.  Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, any application governed under this chapter will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the Planning Division or Public Works Department, as the case may be, within ninety (90) calendar days after the Director deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Director may, in the Director's discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional thirty (30) calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant's reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension. 
E.  Peer and Independent Consultant Review. 
1.  Authorization. The City Council authorizes the Director to, in the Director's discretion, select and retain an independent consultant with specialized training, experience and/or expertise in telecommunications issues satisfactory to the Director in connection any permit application. 
2.  Scope. The Director may request an independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert knowledge in connection with wireless facilities deployment or permit applications for wireless facilities, which include without limitation: (a) permit application completeness and/or accuracy; (b) pre-construction planned compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (c) post-construction actual compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (d) whether and to what extent a proposed project will address a gap in the applicant's wireless services; (e) whether and to what extent any technically feasible and/or potentially available alternative sites or concealment techniques may exist; (f) the applicability, reliability and/or sufficiency of any information, analyses or methodologies used by the applicant to reach any conclusions about any issue with the city's discretion to review; and (g) any other issue identified by the Director that requires expert or specialized knowledge. The Director may request that the independent consultant prepare written reports, testify at public meetings, hearings and/or appeals and attend meetings with city staff and/or the applicant. 
3.  Consultant Fees; Deposit. Subject to applicable law, in the event that the Director elects to retain an independent consultant in connection with any permit application, the applicant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs in connection with the services provided, which may include without limitation any costs incurred by the independent consultant to attend and participate in any meetings or hearings. Before the independent consultant may perform any services, the applicant shall tender to the city a deposit in an amount equal to the estimated cost for the services to be provided, as determined by the Director until the city adopts the initial required deposit by fee schedule. The Director may request additional deposits as reasonably necessary to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover the reasonable costs in connection with the independent consultant's services. In the event that the deposit exceeds the total costs for consultant's services, the Director shall promptly return any unused funds to the applicant after the wireless facility has been installed and passes a final inspection by the Building Official or his or her designee. In the event that the reasonable costs for the independent consultant's services exceed the deposit, the Director shall invoice the applicant for the balance. The city shall not issue any construction or grading permit to any applicant with any unpaid deposit requests or invoices. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.060 - Notice. 
A.  General Notice Requirements. Public notice and a hearing in accordance with the provisions in Section 17.24.020.D. (Public Notice) shall be required for all conditional use permit applications. The approval authority shall administratively review a complete and duly filed application for an administrative wireless permit and may act on such application without a public hearing not less than ten (10) calendar days after the applicant posts notice at the project site. The posted notice must contain (1) a general explanation of the proposed project; (2) the applicant's identification and contact information as provided on the application submitted to the city; and (3) contact information for the applicable city department. 
B.  Deemed-Approval Notice. Not more than thirty (30) days before the applicable FCC timeframe for review expires, and in addition to the public notice required in Section 17.82.060.A. (General Notice Requirements), an applicant for a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit must provide a posted notice at the project site that contains (1) a statement the project will be automatically deemed approved pursuant to California Government Code § 65964.1 unless the city approves or denies the application or the applicant tolls the timeframe for review within the next thirty (30) days; (2) a general explanation of the proposed project; (3) the applicant's identification and contact information as provided on the application submitted to the city; and (4) contact information for the applicable city department. The public notice required under this Section 17.82.060.B. will be deemed given when the applicant delivers written notice to the Director that shows the appropriate notice has been posted at the project site. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Chapter, the approval authority shall be permitted to act on an application at any time so long as the public notice required in Section 17.82.060.A. (General Notice Requirements) has occurred. 
C.  Decision Notices. Within five (5) days after the approval authority acts on an application for a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit or before the FCC Shot Clock expires (whichever occurs first), the approval authority or its designee shall send a written notice to the applicant.

(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.070 - Decisions; limited exemptions; appeals. 
A.  Required Findings for Administrative Wireless Permit Approval. The approval authority may approve or conditionally approve an application for an administrative wireless permit submitted under this chapter when the approval authority finds all of the following: 
1.  The proposed wireless facility complies with all applicable site location guidelines and development standards in Sections 17.82.090 (Site Location Guidelines) and 17.82.100 (Development Standards); and 
2.  The applicant has demonstrated that its proposed wireless facility will be in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations for human exposure to RF emissions. 
B.  Required Findings for Conditional Use Permit Approval. In addition to the conditional use permit findings under Section 17.24.050 (Findings) and the required findings in Section 17.82.070.A, the approval authority may approve or conditionally approve an application for a conditional use permit submitted under this chapter when the approval authority also finds all of the following: 
1.  The applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to identify and evaluate more-preferred alternative locations and potentially less-intrusive alternative designs for the proposed wireless facility; and 
2.  The applicant has provided the approval authority with a meaningful comparative analysis that shows all more-preferred alternative locations and less-intrusive alternative designs identified in the administrative record are either technically infeasible or unavailable. 
C.  Conditional Approvals; Denials Without Prejudice. Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state law, nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the approval authority's ability to conditionally approve or deny without prejudice any application for a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit as may be necessary or appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, and to advance the goals or policies in this chapter, the El Monte Municipal Code or the General Plan. 
D.  Limited Exceptions for Personal Wireless Service Facilities. In the event that an applicant claims that strict compliance with the site location guidelines in Section 17.82.090 (Site Location Guidelines) or the development standards in Section 17.82.100 (Development Standards) would effectively prohibit the applicant's ability to provide personal wireless services, the Planning Commission may grant a limited exception from such requirements to the extent necessary to prevent an effective prohibition when the Planning Commission finds all of the following: 
1.  The proposed wireless facility qualifies as a "personal wireless service facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(C)(ii), as may be amended or superseded; and 
2.  The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility; and 
3.  The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a written statement that contains a detailed and fact-specific explanation as to why the proposed wireless facility cannot be deployed in compliance with the applicable provisions in this Chapter, the El Monte Municipal Code, the General Plan and/or any specific plan; and 
4.  The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a meaningful comparative analysis with the factual reasons why all alternative locations and/or designs identified in the administrative record (whether suggested by the applicant, the city, public comments or any other source) are not technically feasible or potentially available to reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility; and 
5.  The applicant has demonstrated to the Planning Commission that the proposed location and design is the least non-compliant configuration that will reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility, which includes without limitation a meaningful comparative analysis into multiple smaller or less intrusive wireless facilities dispersed throughout the intended service area. 
E.  Appeals. Any interested person or entity may appeal any decision by the approval authority to approve or deny an application for a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit. Appeals must be filed with the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar days following the approval authority's issuance of the decision notice required under Section 17.82.060.C. (Decision Notices). On the next available meeting date after the appeal period lapses, or as soon as reasonably feasible thereafter, the appellate authority shall hold a de novo public hearing to consider and act on the application in accordance with the applicable provisions in the General Plan, any applicable specific plan and all applicable provisions in the El Monte Municipal Code. Appeals from an approval will not be permitted to the extent that the appeal is based on environmental effects from RF emissions that comply with all applicable FCC regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.080 - Standard conditions of approval. 
In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approval authority, all conditional use permits and administrative wireless permits, whether approved by the approval authority or deemed approved by the operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this Section 17.82.080. The approval authority (or the appellate authority on appeal) shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to protect public health and safety or allow for the proper operation of the approved facility consistent with the goals of this chapter. 
A.  Permit Term. This permit will automatically expire ten (10) years and one day from its issuance, except when California Government Code § 65964(b), as may be amended or superseded in the future, authorizes the city to establish a shorter term for public safety or substantial land use reasons. Any other permits or approvals issued in connection with any collocation, modification or other change to this wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or other approvals deemed-granted or deemed-approved under federal or state law, will not extend this term limit unless expressly provided otherwise in such permit or approval or required under federal or state law. Upon an application for permit renewal submitted within one year from the expiration date of this permit, the Director may renew this permit for an additional 10-year term provided that the permittee's wireless facility is in compliance with all applicable conditions of approval and all applicable provisions in the El Monte Municipal Code that exist at the time of the renewal. 
B.  Compliance with Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any applications to the Building Department, the permittee must incorporate this permit, all conditions associated with this permit and the approved photo simulations into the project plans (the "Approved Plans"). The permittee must construct, install and operate the wireless facility in substantial compliance with the Approved Plans, as determined by the Director. Any material alterations, modifications or other changes to the approved plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or public agencies with jurisdiction over the wireless facility, must be submitted in a written request subject to the Director's prior review and approval, who may refer the request to the original approval authority if the Director finds that the requested alteration, modification or other change substantially deviates from the Approved Plans or implicates a significant or substantial land-use concern. 
C.  Build-Out Period. This permit will automatically expire one year from the approval or deemed-granted date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct and/or operate the approved wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or approvals required by the any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the wireless facility or its use. The Director may grant one written extension to a date certain, but not to exceed one additional year, when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition. 
D.  Maintenance Obligations; Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this permit. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within forty-eight (48) hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred. 
E.  Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law ("Laws") applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the wireless facility or any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this permit, which includes without limitation any laws applicable to human exposure to RF emissions. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee's obligations to maintain compliance with all Laws. In the event that the city fails to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance with any applicable provision in the El Monte Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation, the applicant or permittee will not be relieved from its obligation to comply in all respects with all applicable provisions in the El Monte Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation. 
F.  Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee's or its authorized personnel's construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines except during normal construction work hours authorized by the El Monte Municipal Code. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the city. The Director or the Director's designee may issue a stop work order for any activities that violates this condition. 
G.  Inspections; Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be permitted to supervise the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee while any such inspection or emergency access occurs. 
H.  Permittee's Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the Director with accurate and up-to-date contact information to reach a live person responsible for the wireless facility, which includes without limitation a direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times and immediately provide the Director with updated contact information in the event that the contact information changes. 
I.  Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, City Council and City boards, commissions, agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all (1) damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs and other actions or proceedings ("claims") brought against the city or its agents, officers, officials, employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the city's approval of this permit, and (2) other claims of any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee's or its agents', directors', officers', employees', contractors', subcontractors', licensees', or customers' acts or omissions in connection with this permit or the wireless facility. In the event the city becomes aware of any claims, the city will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the city's defense, and the property owner and/or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse city for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the city in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee's indemnification obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the city to approve this permit, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this permit. 
J.  Performance Bond. Before the applicable city department issues any construction or encroachment permit, as applicable, in connection with this permit, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the Director in an amount reasonably necessary to cover the cost to remove the improvements and restore all affected areas based on a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the wireless facility, plus the cost to completely restore any areas affected by the removal work to a standard compliant with applicable laws. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code § 65964(a), the Director shall take into consideration any information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless facility and restore any areas affected by the removal work to a standard compliant with applicable laws. In addition, the Director may modify this condition to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with any reasonable requirements imposed by the permittee's surety. 
K.  Recall to Approval Authority; Permit Revocation. This permit shall be subject to the provisions in El Monte Municipal Code Section 17.24.100 (Revocation). 
L.  Record Retention. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the wireless facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee. The permittee may keep electronic records; provided, however, that hard copies or electronic records kept in the city's regular files will control over any conflicts between such city-controlled copies or records and the permittee's electronic copies, and complete originals will control over all other copies in any form. 
M.  Undergrounded Utilities. In the event that other electric or communications utilities in the public right-of-way underground their facilities where the permittee's wireless facility is located, and the permittee's wireless facility is located in the public right-of-way, the permittee must underground its equipment except the antennas and antenna supports. Such undergrounding shall occur at the permittee's sole cost and expense except as reimbursed pursuant to law. 
N.  Electric Meter Removal. In the event that the electric utility provider adopts or changes its rules obviating the need for a separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure in the public right-of-way, the permittee on its own initiative and at its sole cost and expense shall apply to the city for the required encroachment and/or other ministerial permit(s) to remove the separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure and restore the affected area to its original condition. 
O.  Rearrangement and Relocation. The permittee acknowledges that the City, in its sole discretion and at any time, may: (1) change any street grade, width or location; (2) add, remove or otherwise change any improvements in, on, under or along any street owned by the city or any other public agency, which includes without limitation any sewers, storm drains, conduits, pipes, vaults, boxes, cabinets, poles and utility systems for gas, water, electric or telecommunications; and/or (3) perform any other work deemed necessary, useful or desirable by the City (collectively, "City Work"). The city reserves the rights to do any and all City Work without any admission on its part that the city would not have such rights without the express reservation in this permit. In the event that the Public Works Director determines that any City Work will require the permittee's wireless facility located in the public right-of-way to be rearranged and/or relocated, the permittee shall, at its sole cost and expense, do or cause to be done all things necessary to accomplish such rearrangement and/or relocation. If the permittee fails or refuses to either permanently or temporarily rearrange and/or relocate the permittee's wireless facility within a reasonable time after the Public Works Director's notice, the city may (but will not be obligated to) cause the rearrangement or relocation to be performed at the permittee's sole cost and expense. The city may exercise its rights to rearrange or relocate the permittee's wireless facility without prior notice to permittee when the Public Works Director determines that the City Work is immediately necessary to protect public health or safety. The permittee shall reimburse the city for all costs and expenses in connection with such work within ten (10) days after a written demand for reimbursement and reasonable documentation to support such costs. In addition, the permittee shall indemnify, defend and hold the city, its agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers harmless from and against any claims in connection with rearranging or relocating the permittee's facility, or turning on or off any water, oil, gas, electricity or other utility service in connection with the permittee's facility. 
P.  Abandoned Wireless Facilities. The wireless facility authorized under this permit shall be deemed abandoned if not operated for any continuous six-month period. Within ninety (90) days after a wireless facility is abandoned or deemed abandoned, the permittee and/or property owner shall completely remove the wireless facility and all related improvements, and shall restore all affected areas to a condition compliant with all applicable laws, which includes without limitation the El Monte Municipal Code. In the event that neither the permittee nor the property owner complies with the removal and restoration obligations under this condition within said 90-day period, the city shall have the right (but not the obligation) to perform such removal and restoration with or without notice, and the permittee and property owner shall be jointly and severally liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with such removal and/or restoration activities. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.090 - Site location guidelines. 
A.  Locations. All applicants must, to the extent feasible, propose new wireless facilities on private property or in the public rights-of-way in locations according to the following preferences, ordered from most preferred to least preferred: 
1.  City-owned property or structures located outside the public rights-of-way; 
2.  City-owned property or structures located in the public rights-of-way; 
3.  Manufacturing zones; 
4.  Commercial zones; 
5.  Office professional zones; 
6.  Mixed/multi-use zones; 
7.  Open space; 
8.  Residential zones or uses. 
B.  Preferred Support Structures. In addition to the preferred locations described in Section 17.82.090.A. (Locations), the city also expresses its preference for installations on certain support structures (which include support structures on private property or in the public rights-of-way). The approval authority will take into account whether any more preferred support structures are technically feasible and potentially available. The city's preferred support structures are as follows, ordered from most preferred to least preferred: 
1.  Collocations with existing building or other support structure-mounted wireless facilities; 
2.  Collocations with existing wireless facilities on electric transmission towers; 
3.  Collocations with existing freestanding wireless facilities; 
4.  New installations on existing buildings or other support structures; 
5.  New installations on existing electric transmission towers; and 
6.  New freestanding wireless towers. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.100 - Development standards. 
A.  Generally Applicable Development Standards. All new wireless facilities and collocations, modifications or other changes to existing wireless facilities not covered under Section 6409 must conform to the generally applicable development standards in this Section 17.82.100.A. 
1.  Concealment. Wireless facilities must incorporate concealment elements, measures and techniques that blend the equipment and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment in a manner consistent and/or compatible with the uses germane to the underlying zoning district and existing in the immediate vicinity. As an illustration and not a limitation, a wireless facility designed to mimic a native tree species or a rock outcrop may be appropriate in an open space or hillside location where other natural elements exist to provide effective camouflaging and/or concealment. 
2.  Overall Height. Except as provided in Section 17.82.100.D. (Right-of-Way Facilities), wireless facilities may not exceed the applicable height limit for structures in the applicable zoning district or overlay zone. 
3.  Setbacks. Wireless facilities may not encroach into any applicable setback for structures in the subject zoning district. Applicable setbacks for private property do not apply to wireless facilities located in the public rights-of-way. 
4.  Noise. Wireless facilities and all accessory equipment and transmission equipment must comply with all applicable noise control standards and regulations in Chapter 8.36 (Noise Control), and shall not exceed, either individually or cumulatively, the applicable ambient noise limit in the subject zoning district. The approval authority may require the applicant to incorporate appropriate noise-baffling materials and/or strategies whenever necessary to avoid any ambient noise from equipment (such as backup power generators) reasonably likely to exceed the applicable limit. In the event a duly authorized federal, state, county or city official declares an emergency within a region that includes the city in whole or in part, backup power generators may exceed the applicable noise control standards and regulations to the extent reasonably necessary to operate the facility until the declared emergency is lifted or power is restored to the affected facility. 
5.  Landscaping. All wireless facilities must include landscape features and a landscape plan when proposed to be placed in a landscaped area. The landscape plan must include existing vegetation, and vegetation proposed to be removed or trimmed, and the landscape plan must identify proposed landscaping by species type, size and location. Landscape maintenance must be performed in accordance with Chapter 17.10 (Landscaping Requirements). The approval authority may require additional landscape features to screen the wireless facility from public view, avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties or otherwise enhance the concealment required under this chapter. 
6.  Site Security Measures. Wireless facilities may incorporate reasonable and appropriate site security measures, such as fences, walls and anti-climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft or vandalism. Site security measures must be designed to enhance concealment to the maximum extent possible, such as installing equipment within an enclosure designed to mimic a trash-can corral rather than within a chain link fence. The approval authority may require additional concealment elements as the approval authority finds necessary to blend the security measures and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment. The approval authority shall not approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security measures. 
7.  Backup Power Sources. The approval authority may approve permanent backup power sources and/or generators on a case-by-case basis. The city strongly disfavors backup power sources installed on the ground or mounted on poles within the public rights-of-way. The approval authority shall not approve any diesel generators or other similarly noisy or noxious generators in or within two hundred fifty (250) feet from any residence; provided, however, the approval authority may approve sockets or other connections used for temporary backup generators. 
8.  Lights. Wireless facilities may not include exterior lights other than (a) as may be required under Federal Aviation Administration, FCC or other applicable governmental regulations; and (b) timed or motion-sensitive lights for security and/or worker safety. All exterior lights permitted or required to be installed must be installed in locations and within enclosures that mitigates illumination impacts on other properties to the maximum extent feasible. 
9.  Signage; Advertisements. All wireless facilities must include signage that accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the owner/operator's site name or identification number and a toll-free number to the owner/operator's network operations center. Wireless facilities may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved by the city, required by law or recommended under FCC or other United States governmental agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations. 
10.  Future Collocations and Equipment. To the extent feasible and aesthetically desirable, all new wireless facilities should be designed and sited in a manner that accommodates potential future collocations and equipment installations that can be integrated into the proposed wireless facility or its associated structures with no or negligible visual changes to the outward appearance. 
11.  Utilities. All cables and connectors for telephone, primary electric and other similar utilities must be routed underground to the extent feasible in conduits large enough to accommodate future collocated wireless facilities. Meters, panels, disconnect switches and other associated improvements must be placed in inconspicuous locations to the extent possible. The approval authority shall not approve new overhead utility lines or service drops merely because compliance with the undergrounding requirements would increase the project cost; provided, however, that the Director may waive this requirement to the extent the approval of new overhead lines or service drops would amount to a de minimis visual change. Microwave or other wireless backhaul is discouraged when it would involve a separate and unconcealed antenna. 
12.  Parking; Access. Any equipment or improvements constructed or installed in connection with any wireless facilities must not reduce any parking spaces below the minimum requirement for the subject property. Whenever feasible, wireless facilities should use existing parking and access rather than construct new parking or access improvements. Any new parking or access improvements should be the minimum size necessary to reasonably accommodate the proposed use. 
13.  Compliance with Laws. All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, restrictions and conditions, which include without limitation the California Building Standards Code, General Plan and any applicable specific plan, the El Monte Municipal Code and any conditions or restrictions in any permit or other governmental approval issued by any public agency with jurisdiction over the facility. 
B.  Freestanding Wireless Facilities. In addition to the requirements in Section 17.82.100(A) (Generally Applicable Development Standards), all new freestanding wireless facilities and collocations, modifications or other changes to existing freestanding wireless facilities not covered under Section 6409 must conform to the requirements in this Section 17.82.100(B). 
1.  Tower-Mounted Equipment. All tower-mounted equipment must be mounted as close to the vertical support structure as possible to reduce its overall visual profile. Applicants must mount non-antenna, tower-mounted equipment (including, but not limited to, remote radio units/heads, surge suppressors and utility demarcation boxes) directly behind the antennas to the maximum extent feasible. All tower-mounted equipment, cables and hardware must be painted with flat colors subject to the approval authority's prior approval. 
2.  Ground-Mounted Equipment; Shelters. All ground-mounted equipment must be concealed underground or within an existing or new structure, opaque fences or other enclosures subject to the approval authority's prior approval. The approval authority may require additional concealment elements as the approval authority finds necessary to blend the ground-mounted equipment and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment. 
C.  Building-Mounted Wireless Facilities. In addition to the requirements in Section 17.82.100.A. (Generally Applicable Development Standards), all new building-mounted wireless facilities and collocations, modifications or other changes to existing building-mounted wireless facilities not covered under Section 6409 must conform to the requirements in this Section 17.82.100C. 
1.  Preferred Concealment Techniques. All applicants should, to the extent feasible, propose new non-tower wireless facilities that are completely concealed and architecturally integrated into the existing facade or rooftop features with no visible impacts from any publicly accessible areas at ground level (examples include, but are not limited to, antennas behind existing parapet walls or facades replaced with RF-transparent material and finished to mimic the replaced materials). Alternatively, when integration with existing building features is not feasible, the applicant should propose completely concealed new structures or appurtenances designed to mimic the support structure's original architecture and proportions (examples include, but are not limited to, cupolas, steeples, chimneys and water tanks). Facilities must be located behind existing parapet walls or other existing screening elements to the maximum extent feasible. 
2.  Facade-Mounted Equipment. When wireless facilities cannot be placed behind existing parapet walls or other existing screening elements, the approval authority may approve facade-mounted equipment in accordance with this section. All facade-mounted equipment must be concealed behind screen walls and mounted as flush to the facade as practicable. The approval authority may not approve "pop-out" screen boxes unless the design is architecturally consistent with the original building or support structure. Except in manufacturing zones, the approval authority may not approve any exposed facade-mounted antennas, including but not limited to exposed antennas painted to match the facade. To the extent feasible, facade-mounted equipment must be installed on the facade(s) along the building frontage that is the least prominent or publicly visible. 
3.  Rooftop-Mounted Equipment. All rooftop-mounted equipment must be screened from public view with concealment measures that match the underlying structure in proportion, quality, architectural style and finish. The approval authority may approve unscreened rooftop equipment only when it expressly finds that such equipment is effectively concealed due to its low height and/or setback from the roofline. 
4.  Ground-Mounted Equipment; Shelters. All ground-mounted equipment must be concealed underground or within an existing or new structure, opaque fences, building interior equipment room, or other enclosures subject to the approval authority's prior approval. The approval authority may require additional concealment elements as the approval authority finds necessary to blend the ground-mounted equipment and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment. 
D.  Right-of-Way Wireless Facilities. In addition to the applicable requirements in Section 17.82.100.A. (Generally Applicable Development Standards), all new right-of-way wireless facilities and collocations, modifications or other changes to existing right-of-way wireless facilities not covered under Section 6409 must conform to the requirements in this Section 17.82.100.D. 
1.  Concealment. All wireless facilities in the right-of-way must be concealed to the maximum extent feasible with design elements and techniques that mimic or blend with the underlying support structure, surrounding environment and adjacent uses. In addition, wireless facilities in the rights-of-way may not unreasonably subject the public use, for any purpose including expressive or aesthetic purposes, to inconvenience, discomfort, trouble, annoyance, hindrance, impediment or obstruction. 
2.  Overall Height. Wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way may not exceed either (a) the minimum separation from supply lines required by CPUC General Order 95, as may be amended or superseded, plus four (4) feet or (b) four (4) feet above the height of the existing support structure. To the extent that in the Director's discretion the four-foot height allowance would cause the applicant's wireless facility to be materially incompatible with the overall height or appearance of the surrounding support structures in the public right-of-way, the Director may require the applicant to propose an alternative design (such as mounting the antenna(s) on the side of the pole) or location to the extent technically feasible. 
3.  Existing Support Structures. All wireless facilities in the public right-of-way must be installed on existing above-ground structures (such as light standards or utility poles) whenever possible. The approval authority shall not approve any wireless facility proposed to be installed on a traffic control pole unless the Public Works Director finds, in the Public Works Director's sole discretion, that the traffic control pole has sufficient capacity to support the wireless facility. 
4.  Replacement Support Structures. Existing above-ground structures may be replaced with structurally hardened, fitted or reinforced support structures so long as the replacement structure is, in the Public Works Director's discretion, substantially similar to the existing structure to be replaced. 
5.  New Support Structures. The approval authority shall not approve any new, non-replacement support structures unless: (a) the applicant demonstrates that above-ground support structures within the intended service area either do not exist or are not potentially available to the applicant; or (b) the approval authority specifically finds that a new, non-replacement support structure would be more aesthetically desirable and consistent with the objectives in this chapter than installations on existing structures near the project site. The approval authority shall have the discretion to require that any new support structure must be a streetlight that conforms to the city's streetlight standards and specifications, which the city shall maintain for street illumination and public safety purposes. 
6.  Undergrounded Equipment. To conceal the equipment to the maximum degree feasible, applicants must install all equipment (other than the antenna and any electric meter) underground in any area in which the existing utilities are primarily located underground. In all other areas, applicants shall install all equipment (other than the antenna and any electric meter) underground when the approval authority finds that the above-ground equipment would unreasonably interfere with the public's ability to use the right-of-way for uses that include without limitation travel, social, expressive and/or aesthetic uses. When making a determination on whether to require undergrounded equipment, the approval authority shall take into account the presence of existing above-ground utilities. Mere additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement. If an applicant proposes to install a facility in an area in which the existing utilities are primarily located underground, the approval authority shall have the discretion, consistent with Sections 17.82.100.D.3.5., to require that the applicant install a new streetlight that conforms to the city's streetlight standards and specifications as the facility support structure. 
7.  Pole-Mounted Equipment. All pole-mounted equipment must be installed as close to the pole as technically and legally feasible to minimize the overall visual profile. All pole-mounted equipment and required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures to the extent feasible. All cables, wires and other connectors must be routed through conduits within the pole whenever possible, and all conduit attachments, cables, wires and other connectors must be concealed from public view to the extent feasible. 
8.  Ground-Mounted Equipment. To the extent that the equipment cannot be placed underground as required, applicants may be permitted to install ground-mounted equipment in a location that does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. All ground-mounted equipment must be placed in the least conspicuous location available within a reasonable distance from the pole. The approval authority may condition approval on new or enhanced landscaping to conceal ground-mounted equipment. The approval authority shall not approve a ground-mounted electric meter pedestal or other electric meter enclosure to the extent feasible. 
E.  Administrative Design Guidelines. The Director may develop, and from time to time amend, design guidelines consistent with the generally applicable development standards and any facility-specific development standards to clarify the aesthetic goals and standards in this chapter for city staff, applicants and the public. In the event that a conflict arises between the development standards adopted under Sections 17.82.100.A.D. and the design guidelines adopted under this Section 17.82.100.E., the development standards adopted under Sections 17.82.100.A.D. shall control.

17.82.110 - Temporary wireless facilities. 
A.  General Requirements for Temporary Wireless Facilities. Except as provided in Section 17.82.110.B. (Temporary Wireless Facilities for Emergencies), the requirements, procedures and standards in this section shall be applicable to all applications for a temporary wireless permit for a temporary wireless facility. 
1.  Applications for Temporary Wireless Facilities. The Director shall not approve any temporary wireless facility subject to a temporary wireless permit except upon a duly filed application consistent with this Section 17.82.110.A.1. and any other written application requirements or procedures the Director may publish in any publicly-stated format. Applicants for a temporary wireless permit must submit, at a minimum: (1) a temporary wireless permit application on the most current form prepared by the Planning Department; (2) the applicable fee for the application; (3) a site plan that shows the proposed temporary wireless facility and its equipment, physical dimensions and placement on the proposed site relative to property lines and existing structures; (4) an RF compliance report in accordance with the City's requirements; and (5) an insurance certificate for general commercial liability that names the City as an additional insured, includes coverage for the time period in which the temporary wireless facility will be placed and a carries at least one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in coverage per occurrence. Applications must be submitted in person to the Director unless the Director grants written consent to receive an application by mail or electronic means. No pre-submittal conference or appointment is required for a temporary wireless permit application. 
2.  Administrative Review for Temporary Wireless Facilities. After the Director receives a duly filed application for a temporary wireless permit, the Director shall review the application for completeness. After the Director deems the application complete, the Director shall review the application for conformance with the required findings in Section 17.82.110.A.3. (Required Findings for Temporary Wireless Facilities) and render a written decision to the applicant. Any denials must include the reasons for the denial. The review shall be administrative in nature and shall not require notice or a public hearing. 
3.  Required Findings for Temporary Wireless Facilities. The Director may approve or conditionally approve a temporary wireless permit for a temporary wireless facility only when the Director finds all of the following: 
a.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will not exceed fifty (50) feet in overall height above ground level unless the Director finds that exceeding the 50-foot overall height limit is necessary to integrate a non-freestanding temporary wireless facility with the underlying support structure; and 
b.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will be placed as far away from adjacent property lines as possible, or otherwise in a location that will be least likely to cause adverse impacts on adjacent properties; and 
c.  Any excavation or ground disturbance associated with the temporary facility will not exceed two (2) feet below grade; and 
d.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will be compliant with all generally applicable public health and safety laws and regulations, which includes without limitation compliance with maximum permissible exposure limits for human exposure to RF emissions established by the FCC; and 
e.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will not create any nuisance or violate any noise limits applicable to the proposed location; and 
f.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will be identified with a sign that clearly identifies the (I) site operator, (II) the operator's site identification name or number and (III) a working telephone number answered twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week by a live person who can exert power-down control over the antennas; and 
g.  The proposed temporary wireless facility will be removed within thirty (30) days after the Director grants the temporary wireless permit, or such longer time as the Director finds reasonably related to the applicant's need or purpose for the temporary wireless facility; and 
h.  The applicant has not been denied a use permit for any permanent wireless facility in the same or substantially the same location within the previous three hundred sixty five (365) days. 
4.  Appeals for Temporary Wireless Facilities. Any applicant may appeal the Director's written decision to deny an application for a temporary wireless permit. The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee must be tendered to the city within ten (10) days from the Director's written decision, and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The City Manager shall be the appellate authority for all appeals from the Director's written decision to deny a temporary wireless permit. The City Manager shall review the application de novo; provided, however, that the City Manager's decision shall be limited to only whether the application should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in this chapter and any other applicable laws. The City Manager shall issue a written decision that contains the reasons for the decision, and such decision shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals. 
B.  Temporary Wireless Facilities for Emergencies. Temporary wireless facilities may be placed and operated within the City without a temporary wireless permit only when a duly authorized federal, state, county or city official declares an emergency within a region that includes the city in whole or in part. Any temporary wireless facilities placed pursuant to this Section 17.82.110.B. must be removed within fifteen (15) days after the date the emergency is lifted. Any person or entity that places temporary wireless facilities pursuant to this section must send a written notice that identifies the site location and person responsible for its operation to the Director as soon as reasonably practicable. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.82.120 - Amortization of nonconforming wireless facilities. 
Any non-conforming wireless facilities in existence at the time this chapter becomes effective must be brought into conformance with this chapter in accordance with the amortization schedule in this Section 17.82.120. As used in this section, the "fair market value" will be the construction costs listed on the building permit application for the subject wireless facility and the "minimum years" allowed will be measured from the date on which this chapter becomes effective. 
Fair Market Value on Effective Date 	Minimum Years Allowed 
Less than $50,000 	5 
$50,000 to $500,000 	10 
Greater than $500,000 	15 
 
The Director may grant a written extension to a date certain when the wireless facility owner shows (1) a good faith effort to cure non-conformance; (2) the application of this section would violate applicable laws; or (3) extreme economic hardship would result from strict compliance with the amortization schedule. Any extension must be the minimum time period necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The Director may not grant any permanent exemption from this section. 
Nothing in this section is intended to limit any permit term to less than ten (10) years. In the event that the amortization required in this section would reduce the permit term to less than ten (10) years for any permit granted on or after January 1, 2007, then the minimum years allowed will be automatically extended by the difference between ten (10) years and the number of years since the city granted such permit. Nothing in this section is intended or may be applied to prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) on the basis that the subject wireless facility is a legal nonconforming wireless facility. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
Chapter 17.83 - ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUESTS 
Sections: 
 
17.83.010 - Legislative intent. 
A.  Background. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-96, codified as 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) ("Section 6409"), generally requires that state and local governments "may not deny, and shall approve" requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations interpret this statute and establish procedural rules for local review, which generally preempt certain subjective land-use regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential "deemed granted" remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty (60) days after submittal (accounting for any tolling periods). Moreover, whereas Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, codified as 47 U.S.C. § 332, applies to only "personal wireless service facilities" (e.g., cellular telephone towers and equipment), Section 6409 applies to all "wireless" facilities licensed or authorized by the FCC (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, microwave backhaul, etc.). 
B.  Findings. The City Council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under Section 6409 and other wireless deployments, combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments, creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values. The City Council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with Section 6409 contained in a separate section devoted to Section 6409 will mitigate such potential confusion, streamline local review and preserve the city's land-use authority to maximum extent possible. 
C.  Intent. The city intends this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with and subject to federal and California state law, for collocations and modifications to existing wireless facilities pursuant to Section 6409 and related FCC regulations codified in 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.40001 et seq. This Chapter is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: (1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider's ability to provide personal wireless services; (2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity's ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules, regulations or other legal requirements for rights-of-way management; (3) unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such wireless facilities comply with the FCC's regulations concerning such emissions; (5) prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under federal or California state law; (6) impose any unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory or anticompetitive fees that exceed the reasonable cost to provide the services for which the fee is charged; or (7) otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or California state law. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.83.020 - Definitions. 
The abbreviations, phrases, terms and words used in this chapter will have the meanings assigned to them in this Section 17.83.020 or, as may be appropriate, in Section 17.04.020 (Definitions), as may be amended from time to time, unless context indicates otherwise. Undefined phrases, terms or words in this section will have the meanings assigned to them in 47 U.S.C. § 153, as may be amended from time to time, and, if not defined therein, will have their ordinary meanings. In the event that any definition assigned to any phrase, term or word in this section conflicts with any federal or state-mandated definition, the federal or state-mandated definition will control. 
A.  "Approval authority" means the commission, board or official responsible for review of permit applications and vested with the authority to approve or deny such applications. The approval authority for a section 6409 approval is the Economic Development Director or, on appeal, the City Manager. The foregoing notwithstanding, the approval authority for a section 6409 approval relating to wireless facilities within the public rights-of-way is the Public Works Director, or, on appeal, the City Manager. 
B.  "Base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower. The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks). The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001, supports or houses equipment described in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(1)(i)-(ii) that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001, does not support or house equipment described in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 (b)(1)(i)-(ii). 
C.  "City Manager" means the City Manager of the City of El Monte, or the City Manager's designee. 
D.  "Collocation" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition effectively means "to add" and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site. 
E.  "CPCN" means a "Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity" granted by the CPUC or its duly appointed successor agency pursuant to California Public Utilities Code §§ 1001 et seq., as may be amended. 
F.  "CPUC" means the California Public Utilities Commission established in the California Constitution, Article XII, § 5, or its duly appointed successor agency. 
G.  "Economic Development Director" or "Director" means the Economic Development Director of the City of El Monte, or the Economic Development Director's designee. When used in the context of applications related to wireless facilities on private property, the Director refers to the Economic Development Director. 
H.  "Eligible facilities request" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (i) collocation of new transmission equipment; (ii) removal of transmission equipment; or (iii) replacement of transmission equipment. 
I.  "Eligible support structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as any tower or base station as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b), provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001. 
J.  "Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the FCC's Section 6409 regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition. 
K.  "FCC" means the Federal Communications Commission or its duly appointed successor agency. 
L.  "FCC Shot Clock" means the reasonable time frame within which the city generally must act on a given wireless application, as defined by the FCC and as may be amended from time-to-time. 
M.  "Planning Division" means the Planning Division of the Economic Development Department of the City of El Monte or its duly appointed successor agency. 
N.  "Public Works Department" means the Public Works Department of the City of El Monte or its duly appointed successor agency. 
O.  "Public Works Director" or "Director" means the Public Works and Utilities Director of the City of El Monte, or the Public Works Director's designee. When used in the context of applications related to wireless facilities in the public right-of-way, the Director refers to the Public Works Director. 
P.  "RF" means radio frequency or electromagnetic waves generally between 30 kHz and 300 GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum range. 
Q.  "Section 6409" means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), as may be amended. 
R.  "Site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 
S.  "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular wireless facility type (tower or base station) and location (in or outside the public right-of-way). For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC's criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the wireless facility type and location. 
a.  For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when: 
i.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the height of the tower by more than ten (10) percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet (whichever is greater); or 
ii.  The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower by more than twenty (20) feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or 
iii.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four (4); or 
iv.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site. 
b.  For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when: 
i.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the height of the structure by more than ten (10) percent or more than ten (10) feet (whichever is greater); or 
ii.  The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six (6) feet; or 
iii.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure; or 
iv.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are more than ten (10) percent larger in height or volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; or 
v.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 
c.  In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when: 
i.  The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure; or 
ii.  The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 (b)(7)(i)-(iv). 
T.  "Tower" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles (i.e., a bare, unconcealed pole solely intended to support wireless transmission equipment), mono-trees and lattice towers. 
U.  "Transmission equipment" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply.

17.83.030 - Applicability. 
This Section 17.83.030 applies to all requests for approval to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted pursuant to Section 6409. However, the applicant may voluntarily elect to seek a conditional use permit or administrative wireless permit under Chapter 17.82 (New and Substantially Changed Wireless Facilities). 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.83.040 - Approvals required. 
A.  Section 6409 Approval. Any request to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for approval under Section 6409 shall require an administrative approval in such form determined by the Director consistent with all valid and enforceable terms and conditions of the underlying use permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the tower or base station (each amendment a "section 6409 approval"). Each section 6409 approval shall be subject to the approval authority's approval, conditional approval or denial without prejudice pursuant to the standards and procedures contained in this chapter. 
B.  Other Permits and Regulatory Approvals. No collocation or modification approved pursuant to this chapter may occur unless the applicant also obtains all other permits and regulatory approvals as may be required by any other federal, state or local government agencies, which includes without limitation any permits and/or regulatory approvals issued by other departments or divisions within the city. Furthermore, any section 6409 approval granted under this chapter shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions and/or legal requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory approvals. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.83.050 - Application requirements. 
A.  Application Required. The approval authority shall not approve any request for a collocation or modification submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409 except upon a duly filed application consistent with this Section 17.83.050 and any other written rules the city or the Director may establish from time to time in any publicly-stated format. 
B.  Application Content. All applications for a section 6409 approval must include all the content, information and materials required by the Director. The City Council authorizes the Director to develop, publish and from time-to-time update or amend permit application requirements, forms, checklists, guidelines, informational handouts and other related materials that the Director finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing requests for section 6409 approvals. However, the Director may not require documentation proving the need or presenting the business case for the proposed modification. The City Council further authorizes the Director to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the Director deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice. 
C.  Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. Any application for a section 6409 approval will not be considered duly filed unless submitted in accordance with the procedures in this Section 17.83.050.C. 
1.  Pre-Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, the applicant must schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the Director for all proposed collocations or modifications to any concealed or camouflaged wireless tower or base station. Pre-submittal conferences for all other proposed collocations or modifications are strongly encouraged but not required. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and review process, including whether the project qualifies for approval pursuant to Section 6409 or not; any latent issues in connection with the existing wireless tower or base station, including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination with other city departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that city staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Planning Division or Public Works Department, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the city for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-submittal conference. 
2.  Submittal Appointment. All applications must be submitted to the city at a pre-scheduled appointment with the Director. Applicants may submit up to ten (10) applications per appointment whenever feasible for city staff and not prejudicial to other applicants. The Director shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after the Director receives a written request and, if applicable, confirms that the applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person, by mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the Director at a pre-submittal conference. 
D.  Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, any application governed under this chapter will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the Planning Division or Public Works Department, as the case may be, within ninety (90) calendar days after the Director deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Director may, in the Director's discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional thirty (30) calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant's reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension. 
E.  Peer and Independent Consultant Review. 
1.  Authorization. The City Council authorizes the Director to, in the Director's discretion, select and retain an independent consultant with specialized training, experience and/or expertise in telecommunications issues satisfactory to the Director in connection any permit application. 
2.  Scope. The Director may request an independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert knowledge in connection with wireless facilities deployment or permit applications for wireless facilities, which include without limitation: (a) permit application completeness and/or accuracy; (b) pre-construction planned compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (c) post-construction actual compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (d) the applicability, reliability and/or sufficiency of any information, analyses or methodologies used by the applicant to reach any conclusions about any issue with the city's discretion to review; and (e) any other issue identified by the Director that requires expert or specialized knowledge. The Director may request that the independent consultant prepare written reports, testify at public meetings, hearings and/or appeals and attend meetings with city staff and/or the applicant. 
3.  Consultant Fees; Deposit. Subject to applicable law, in the event that the Director elects to retain an independent consultant in connection with any permit application, the applicant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs in connection with the services provided, which may include without limitation any costs incurred by the independent consultant to attend and participate in any meetings or hearings. Before the independent consultant may perform any services, the applicant shall tender to the city a deposit in an amount equal to the estimated cost for the services to be provided, as determined by the Director until the city adopts the initial required deposit by fee schedule. The Director may request additional deposits as reasonably necessary to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover the reasonable costs in connection with the independent consultant's services. In the event that the deposit exceeds the total costs for consultant's services, the Director shall promptly return any unused funds to the applicant after the wireless facility has been installed and passes a final inspection by the Building Official or his or her designee. In the event that the reasonable costs for the independent consultant's services exceed the deposit, the Director shall invoice the applicant for the balance. The city shall not issue any construction or grading permit to any applicant with any unpaid deposit requests or invoices. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.83.060 - Decisions; appeals. 
A.  Administrative Review. The approval authority shall administratively review a complete and duly filed application for a section 6409 approval, and may act on such application without prior notice or a public hearing. 
B.  Decision Notices. Within five (5) days after the approval authority acts on an application for a section 6409 approval or before the FCC Shot Clock expires (whichever occurs first), the approval authority shall send a written notice to the applicant. In the event that the approval authority denies the application, the written notice to the applicant must contain (1) the reasons for the decision; (2) a statement that denial will be without prejudice; and (3) instructions for how and when to file an appeal. 
C.  Required Findings for Approval. The approval authority may approve or conditionally approve an application any application for a section 6409 approval when the approval authority finds that the proposed project: 
1.  Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and 
2.  Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing wireless tower or base station. 
D.  Criteria for Denial without Prejudice. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the approval authority may deny without prejudice any application for a section 6409 approval when the approval authority finds that the proposed project: 
1.  Does not meet the findings required in Section 17.83.060.C. (Required Findings for Approval); 
2.  Involves the replacement of the entire support structure; or 
3.  Violates any legally enforceable law, regulation, rule, standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health or safety. 
E.  Conditional Approvals. Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state law, nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the approval authority's authority to conditionally approve an application for a section 6409 approval to protect and promote the public health and safety. 
F.  Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the approval authority's written decision to deny without prejudice an application for section 6409 approval. The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee must be tendered to the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar days from the approval authority's written decision, and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The City Manager shall be the appellate authority for all appeals from the approval authority's written decision to deny without prejudice an application for section 6409 approval. The City Manager shall review the application de novo; provided, however, that the City Manager's decision shall be limited to only whether the application should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in this chapter and any other applicable laws. The City Manager shall issue a written decision that contains the reasons for the decision, and such decision shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals. 
(Ord. No. 2930, § 2, 8-7-2018)  
17.83.070 - Standard conditions of approval. 
In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approval authority, all section 6409 approvals, whether approved by the approval authority or deemed approved by the operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this Section 17.83.070. The approval authority (or the City Manager in the City Manager's capacity as the appellate authority) shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to protect public health and safety or allow for the proper operation of the approved facility consistent with the goals of this chapter. 
A.  Permit Term. The city's grant or grant by operation of law of a section 6409 approval constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station, and will be regarded as a modification to the underlying approval for the subject tower or base station. The city's grant or grant by operation of law of a section 6409 approval will not extend the permit term, if any, for any underlying permit or other underlying prior regulatory authorization. Accordingly, the term for a section 6409 approval shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station. 
B.  Compliance Obligations Due to Invalidation. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates all or any portion of Section 6409 or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409 such that federal law would not mandate approval for any section 6409 approval(s), such approval(s) shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, unless the decision would not authorize accelerated termination of previously approved section 6409 approvals or the Director grants an extension upon written request from the permittee that shows good cause for the extension, which includes without limitation extreme financial hardship. Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, the Director may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension. A permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated section 6409 approval when it has obtained the applicable permit(s) or submitted an application for such permit(s) before the one-year period ends. 
C.  City's Standing Reserved. The city's grant or grant by operation of law of a section 6409 approval does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409, any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409 or any section 6409 approval. 
D.  Compliance with Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any applications to the Building Division, the permittee must incorporate this section 6409 approval, all conditions associated with this section 6409 approval and the approved photo simulations into the project plans (the "approved plans"). The permittee must construct, install and operate the wireless facility in substantial compliance with the approved plans, as determined by the Director. Any material alterations, modifications or other changes to the approved plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or public agencies with jurisdiction over the wireless facility, must be submitted in a written request subject to the Director's prior review and approval. The Director may revoke the section 6409 approval if the Director finds that the requested alteration, modification or other change causes a substantial change as that term is defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 (b)(7), as may be amended. 
E.  Build-Out Period. This section 6409 approval will automatically expire one year from the approval or deemed-granted date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct and/or operate the approved wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or approvals required by any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the wireless facility or its use. The Director may grant one written extension up to one year when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition. 
F.  Maintenance Obligations; Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this section 6409 approval. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within forty-eight (48) hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred. 
G.  Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law ("Laws") applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the wireless facility or any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this section 6409 approval, which includes without limitation any laws applicable to human exposure to RF emissions. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee's obligations to maintain compliance with all laws. In the event that the city fails to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance with any applicable provision in the El Monte Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation, the applicant or permittee will not be relieved from its obligation to comply in all respects with all applicable provisions in the El Monte Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation. 
H.  Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee's or its authorized personnel's construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. Undue or unnecessary adverse impacts shall not be interpreted to mean aesthetic impacts that may result from the city's issuance of this section 6409 approval consistent with applicable law. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines except during normal construction hours authorized by the El Monte Municipal Code. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the city. The Director or the Director's designee may issue a stop work order for any activities that violates this condition. 
I.  Inspections; Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be permitted to supervise the city's officers, officials, staff or other designee while any such inspection or emergency access occurs. 
J.  Permittee's Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the Director with accurate and up-to-date contact information to reach a live person responsible for the wireless facility, which includes without limitation a direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times and immediately provide the Director with updated contact information in the event that the contact information changes. 
K.  Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which the wireless facility is installed, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, City Council and City boards, commissions, agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all (1) damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs and other actions or proceedings ("claims") brought against the city or its agents, officers, officials, employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the city's approval of this section 6409 approval, and (2) other claims of any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee's or its agents', directors', officers', employees', contractors', subcontractors', licensees', or customers' acts or omissions in connection with this section 6409 approval or the wireless facility. In the event the city becomes aware of any claims, the city will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the city's defense, and the property owner and/or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse city for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the city in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee's indemnification obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the city to approve this section 6409 approval, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this section 6409 approval. 
L.  Performance Bond. Before the applicable city department issues any construction or encroachment permit, as applicable, in connection with this section 6409 approval, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the Director in an amount reasonably necessary to cover the cost to remove the improvements and restore all affected areas based on a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the wireless facility, plus the cost to completely restore any areas affected by the removal work to a standard compliant with applicable laws. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code § 65964(a), the Director shall take into consideration any information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless facility to a standard compliant with applicable laws. In addition, the Director may modify this condition to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with any reasonable requirements imposed by the permittee's surety. 
M.  Recall to Approval Authority; Permit Revocation. This permit shall be subject to El Monte Municipal Code Section 17.24.100 (Revocation). 
N.  Record Retention. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the wireless facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee. The permittee may keep electronic records; provided, however, that hard copies or electronic records kept in the city's regular files will control over any conflicts between such city-controlled copies or records and the permittee's electronic copies, and complete originals will control over all other copies in any form. 
O.  Undergrounded Utilities. In the event that other electric or communications utilities in the public right-of-way underground their facilities where the permittee's wireless facility is located, and the permittee's wireless facility is located in the public right-of-way, the permittee must underground its equipment except the antennas and antenna supports. Such undergrounding shall occur at the permittee's sole cost and expense except as reimbursed pursuant to law. 
P.  Electric Meter Removal. In the event that the electric utility provider adopts or changes its rules obviating the need for a separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure in the public right-of-way, the permittee on its own initiative and at its sole cost and expense shall apply to the city for the required encroachment and/or other ministerial permit(s) to remove the separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure and restore the affected area to its original condition. 
Q.  Rearrangement and Relocation. The permittee acknowledges that the City, in its sole discretion and at any time, may: (1) change any street grade, width or location; (2) add, remove or otherwise change any improvements in, on, under or along any street owned by the city or any other public agency, which includes without limitation any sewers, storm drains, conduits, pipes, vaults, boxes, cabinets, poles and utility systems for gas, water, electric or telecommunications; and/or (3) perform any other work deemed necessary, useful or desirable by the City (collectively, "City Work"). The city reserves the rights to do any and all City Work without any admission on its part that the city would not have such rights without the express reservation in this permit. In the event that the Public Works Director determines that any City Work will require the permittee's wireless facility located in the public right-of-way to be rearranged and/or relocated, the permittee shall, at its sole cost and expense, do or cause to be done all things necessary to accomplish such rearrangement and/or relocation. If the permittee fails or refuses to either permanently or temporarily rearrange and/or relocate the permittee's wireless facility within a reasonable time after the Public Works Director's notice, the city may (but will not be obligated to) cause the rearrangement or relocation to be performed at the permittee's sole cost and expense. The city may exercise its rights to rearrange or relocate the permittee's wireless facility without prior notice to permittee when the Public Works Director determines that the City Work is immediately necessary to protect public health or safety. The permittee shall reimburse the city for all costs and expenses in connection with such work within ten (10) days after a written demand for reimbursement and reasonable documentation to support such costs. In addition, the permittee shall indemnify, defend and hold the city, its agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers harmless from and against any claims in connection with rearranging or relocating the permittee's facility, or turning on or off any water, oil, gas, electricity or other utility service in connection with the permittee's facility. 
R.  Abandoned Wireless Facilities. The wireless facility authorized under this permit shall be deemed abandoned if not operated for any continuous six-month period. Within ninety (90) days after a wireless facility is abandoned or deemed abandoned, the permittee and/or property owner shall completely remove the wireless facility and all related improvements, and shall restore all affected areas to a condition compliant with all applicable laws, which includes without limitation the El Monte Municipal Code. In the event that neither the permittee nor the property owner complies with the removal and restoration obligations under this condition within said 90-day period, the city shall have the right (but not the obligation) to perform such removal and restoration with or without notice, and the permittee and property owner shall be jointly and severally liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with such removal and/or restoration activities.

17.84.150 - Setting hearing date by City Council.

The ordinance shall be subject to referendum and refer to and incorporate by reference the text of the development agreement. The development agreement shall not be binding or enforceable prior to the effective date of the ordinance approving the development agreement and execution of the development agreement by all parties thereto. 
Because a development agreement is also a contract which requires the consent of each party in order to become binding, the council reserves the right to disapprove entering into any development agreement, regardless of the provisions hereof, and the ordinance shall be advisory only and shall not require the acceptance of any development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.170 - Conduct of hearing by the City Council.

The City Council may also act on all or any such issue without reference back to the Planning Commission. The decision of the City Council shall be rendered within forty-five (45) days after the hearing before the City Council or within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the final report from the Planning Commission, whichever is later, unless extended by mutual agreement of the qualified applicant and City Council.

(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.210 - Coordination of development agreement application with other discretionary approvals. 
It is the intent of this chapter that the application for a development agreement will be made and considered simultaneously with the review of other necessary applications, including, but not limited to rezoning, planned commercial, or industrial development and conditional use permits. If combined with an application for rezoning, planned development or conditional use permit, the application for a development agreement shall be submitted with said application and shall be processed, to the maximum extent possible, jointly to avoid duplication of hearings and repetition of information. A development agreement is not a substitute for, nor an alternative to, any other required permit or approval, and the qualified applicant or developer must comply with all other required procedures for development approval. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.220 - Time for and initiation of review. 
(a)  Regular Periodic Review. The city shall review the performance of the developer under a development agreement periodically on a regular basis as determined in the development agreement or by this subsection at least once every twelve (12) months for the term of the development agreement. Ninety (90) days prior to the "established date or dates for regular periodic review" which shall be the anniversary of the effective date of the development agreement, or such other substitute date or dates, mutually agreed to by the qualified applicant or developer and city in writing for such regular periodic reviews, the developer shall submit to the Planning Services Manager evidence of the good faith compliance with the development agreement. If the Planning Services Manager determines that such evidence is insufficient for the Planning Services Manager's regular periodic review, or if the developer fails to submit any evidence, then prior to seventy-five (75) days of the established date or dates for regular periodic review the Planning Services Manager shall deliver or mail written notice to the developer of the developer's failure to submit any evidence or specifying the additional information reasonably required by the Planning Services Manager in order to review the developer's good faith compliance with the development agreement. The developer shall have thirty (30) days after mailing or delivery of such written notice by the Planning Services Manager in which to respond to the Planning Services Manager. If the developer fails to provide such information to the Planning Services Manager within the thirty (30) day period, the Planning Services Manager shall not find that the developer has complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement. 
(b)  Special Review. 
(1)  Initiation of Review. Reviews which are other than the regular periodic reviews provided for in subsection (a) of this section are defined as special reviews and may be had either by agreement between the developer and city or by initiation of the city by the affirmative vote of the City Council, but in any event shall not be held more frequently than three (3) times a year. 
(2)  Notice of Special Review. The Planning Services Manager shall begin the special review proceeding by mailing or delivering written notice to the developer that the city intends to undertake a special review for the good faith compliance of developer with the development agreement. He shall mail or deliver to the developer a thirty (30) day notice of intent to undertake such a special review within which thirty (30) days developer shall provide to the Planning Services Manager evidence of good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. If the Planning Services Manager determines that such evidence is insufficient for the Planning Services Manager's review, or if the developer fails to submit any evidence within the thirty-day period, then within forty-five (45) days of giving the notice of intent to undertake a special review, the Planning Services Manager shall deliver or mail written notice to the developer of the developer's failure to submit any evidence or additional information reasonably required by the Planning Services Manager in order to review the developer's good faith compliance with the development agreement. As with the regular periodic review, the developer shall have thirty (30) days after mailing or delivering of such written notice by the Planning Services Manager in which to respond to the Planning Services Manager. If the developer fails to provide such information to the Planning Services Manager within the thirty-day period, developer shall not be found by the Planning Services Manager to have complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.230 - Finding of compliance. 
With respect to either a regular periodic review or a special review, if the Planning Services Manager finds good faith compliance by the developer with the terms of the development agreement for the period reviewed, the Planning Services Manager, upon request of developer, shall issue a certificate of compliance for such period reviewed, which shall be in recordable form and may be recorded by the developer in the official records of Los Angeles County. The issuance of a certificate of compliance by the Planning Services Manager shall conclude the review for the applicable period for which the finding was made and such determination shall be final in the absence of fraud. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.240 - Failure to find good faith compliance. 
If the Planning Services Manager does not find, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the developer has complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement, he shall so notify the City Council and the developer. The Planning Services Manager shall specify the reasons for the Planning Services Manager's determination, the information relied upon in making such decision and any findings made with respect thereto. At the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council on which the matter is agendized, or to which it is continued, the City Council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  Compliance.

(ii)  Hearing. Set a date for a public hearing on the issue of compliance by the developer with the terms of the development agreement and the possible conditioning and/or termination or modification of the development agreement in accordance with California Government Code Section 65865.1, which public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section 17.82.250. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.250 - Public hearing. 
The City Council shall, within ninety (90) days of the City Council's setting a date for a public hearing in Section 17.82.240(2)(ii), conduct a public hearing at which the developer shall have the opportunity to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement on the basis of substantial evidence presented to the City Council.

If the City Council finds and determines on the basis of substantial evidence that the developer has not complied in good faith with the terms and conditions of the development agreement during the period under review, the City Council may allow the development agreement to be continued by imposition of new terms and conditions intended to remedy such noncompliance or to be otherwise modified, by the mutual consent of the developer and the city or the City Council may unilaterally terminate the development agreement or take other action authorized by Government Code Section 65865.1. The City Council may impose such terms and conditions to the action it takes as it considers necessary to protect the interests of the city. The decision of the City Council shall be final. The rights of the parties after termination shall be as set forth in Section 17.82.370. 
(c)  Ordinance. Any termination, modification or imposition of new terms and conditions pursuant to this section shall be by ordinance. The ordinance shall recite the facts, findings, information relied on and/or the lack thereof, and the reasons which, in the opinion of the City Council, make the termination or modifications or imposition of new terms and conditions of the development agreement necessary. The enactment of such an ordinance by the City Council shall be final and conclusive as to its effect on the subject development agreement. Not later than ten (10) days following the adoption of the ordinance, one copy thereof shall be forwarded to the developer.

(d)  Although approved by the City Council, an amendment to or cancellation of a development agreement shall not be binding or enforceable prior to the effective date of the ordinance approving the amendment or cancellation of the development agreement and the execution of such amendment or a written consent to such cancellation by all parties to the development agreement or by their successors in interest. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.310 - Failure to receive notice.

(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.320 - Rules governing conduct of hearing. 
All the public hearings under this chapter shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures and the time limits specified for the conduct of such hearings in this chapter. A copy of any relevant proposed or existing development agreement shall be made available for public review at the City Clerk's office prior to the date of each hearing thereon. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.330 - Irregularity in proceeding. 
Formal rules of evidence or procedure which must be followed in a court of law shall not be applied in the consideration of a proposed development agreement, its modification, cancellation, or termination under this chapter and the provisions of this chapter shall provide the procedure for such consideration. The qualified applicant or developer has the burden of presenting substantial evidence at each of the public hearings on the proposal and shall be given an opportunity to present evidence in support of the qualified applicant's or developer's position. No action, inaction, or recommendation regarding the proposed development agreement, its modification, cancellation, or termination shall be held void or invalid or be set aside by a court on the ground of the improper admission or rejection of evidence or by reason of any error, irregularity, informality, neglect, or omission ("error") as to any matter pertaining to petition, application, notice, finding, record, hearing, report, recommendation, or any matters of procedure whatever unless after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, the court finds that the error complained of was prejudicial and that by reason of the error the complaining party sustained and suffered substantial injury, and that a different result would have been probable if the error had not occurred or existed.

A development agreement shall not prevent the city, in subsequent actions applicable to the property or to the city in general, from applying new rules, regulations, and policies which do not conflict with those rules, regulations, and policies applicable to the property at the time of execution of the development agreement, nor shall a development agreement prevent the city from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent development project application on the basis of such existing or new rules, regulations, and policies. Each development agreement shall provide, and it is provided in this section, that this section and the provisions thereof do not apply to taxes, imposts, assessments, fees, charges or other exactions imposed by or payable to city unless specifically and to the extent otherwise expressly agreed to by city in the development agreement, and that all of such shall be in amounts fixed at the time they are payable. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)  
17.84.370 - Rights of the parties after cancellation or termination. 
In the event that a development agreement is canceled, or otherwise terminated, unless otherwise agreed in writing by city, all rights of the developer, property owner or successors in interest under the development agreement shall terminate and any and all benefits, including money or land, received by the city shall be retained by the city. Notwithstanding the above provision, any termination of the development agreement shall not prevent the developer from completing a building or other improvements authorized to be constructed pursuant to a valid operative building permit previously approved by the city and under construction at the time of termination, but the city may take any action permitted by law to prevent, stop, or correct any violation of law occurring during and after construction, and neither the developer nor any tenant shall occupy any portion of the project or any building not authorized by an occupancy permit. As used herein, "construction" shall mean work on site under a valid building permit and "completing" shall mean completion of construction for beneficial occupancy for developer's use, or if a portion of the project is intended for use by a lessee or tenant, then for such portion "completion" shall mean completion of construction except for interior improvements such as partitions, duct and electrical run outs, floor coverings, wall coverings, lighting, furniture, trade fixtures, finished ceilings, and other improvements typically constructed by or for tenants of similar buildings. All such uses shall, to the extent applicable, be deemed nonconforming uses and shall be subject to the nonconforming use provisions of El Monte Municipal Code. 
(Ord. No. 2735, § 1, 2-17-2009)

Each applicant who requests a density bonus pursuant to this section, shall elect whether the bonus will be awarded on the basis of subsection A.1, A.2, A.3 or B of this section. Each housing development is entitled to only one density bonus, which may be selected based on the percentage of either very low income affordable housing units, lower income affordable housing units or moderate income affordable housing units, or the development's status as a senior citizen housing development. Density bonuses from more than one of these categories may not be combined. 
F.  Density Bonus of up to Fifty (50) Percent for Senior and Large Multi-Family Rental Units. Affordable rental housing for seniors and affordable multi-family rental housing in which a minimum thirty (30) percent of the units are three (3) bedrooms or more may be granted a density bonus of up to fifty (50) percent above the maximum density, according to the following formula: for each additional percentage point of very low income units above eleven (11) percent, a bonus of two and one-half (2.5) percent may be granted, for each additional percentage point of low-income units above twenty (20) percent, a bonus of one and one-half (1.5) percent may be granted, and for each percentage point of moderate-income units above forty (40) percent, a bonus of one percent may be granted. 
1.  The location, size, and design of the proposed use shall not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to the city of El Monte general plan, adjacent uses, residents, buildings, structures, or natural resources, with consideration given to:

G.  Recapture of financial interest/affordable units may be offered for subsequent sale to an above-moderate income purchaser; provided that the sale results in a recapture by the city, or its designee, of a financial interest in the unit equal to: 
1.  The difference between the initial affordable income level (very low, low, or moderate) sales price and the appraised value at the time of the initial sale; and 
2.  A proportionate share of any appreciation. 
H.  Forfeiture of Funds. Any individual who rents a unit in violation of this chapter shall be required to forfeit all rents above the applicable affordable rate; any individual who sells a unit in violation of this chapter shall be required to forfeit all profits from the sale exceeding the difference between the sales price and the applicable affordable sales prices.

2.  The land must be transferred no later than the date of the approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or housing development application; and 
3.  The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred must be sufficient to permit construction of dwelling units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than ten (10) percent of the total number of market rate dwelling units in the proposed development (i.e., the proposed development before the addition of any density bonus); and 
4.  The donated land is at least one acre in size or is large enough to permit development of at least forty (40) units, has the appropriate general plan land use designation, has the appropriate zoning and development standards for affordable housing and, at the time of project approval is, or at the time of construction will be, served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure; and

A.  An applicant for a conversion of existing rental apartments to condominiums is eligible for either a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value, at the option of the city, if the applicant agrees to provide: 1) at least thirty-three (33) percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project to persons and families of low or moderate income as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code, or 2) at least fifteen (15) percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project to lower income households as defined in Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code, and 3) the applicant agrees to pay for the reasonably necessary administrative costs incurred by the city pursuant to this section. 
B.  Condominium conversions qualified under subsection A of this section, may receive one of the following, at the city's option: 
1.  A flat density bonus of twenty-five (25) percent to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion, excepting that a condominium conversion is ineligible for this bonus if the apartments to be converted originally received a density bonus or incentives pursuant to any other provisions of this article or pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915. An applicant may choose to implement a lower density bonus. 
2.  Incentives of equivalent financial value in the form of a reduction or waiver of requirements or fees which the city might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval. "Other incentives of equivalent financial value" shall not be construed to require the city to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation to the condominium conversion project or its applicant. 
C.  The city reserves the right to place such reasonable conditions on the granting of a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value pursuant to this section as it finds appropriate, including, but not limited to, conditions which assure continued affordability of units to subsequent purchasers who are persons and families of low and moderate income or lower income households. 
D.  Condominium conversions are eligible only for the granting of a density bonus or incentive of equivalent value pursuant to this section, which bonus or incentive may not be granted in addition to, or combined with, any other incentives, concessions, density bonuses or waivers and reductions of development standards pursuant to other sections of this article.

This calculation shall start with the base density of the zone in which the housing development is located as described in Section 17.06.030Residential density. 
C.  For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the dwelling units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the affordable units are located. 
D.  For the purposes of this article, the "total units" or "total dwelling units" in a housing development does not include those units added by any density bonus.

17.85.070 - Incentives and concessions for affordable housing. 
A.  Definition of a Qualified Incentive or Concession. A qualifying project shall be entitled to at least one but no more than three (3) of the following incentives identified by state law: 
1.  A reduction in the parcel development standards (e.g. coverage, setback, zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes, architectural design requirements and/or parking requirements). Development standard means any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation. In no case may the city apply a development standard that will have the effect of precluding the construction of affordable units. A waiver or modification to development standards may be requested by the applicant, and shall be approved unless such waiver or modification creates an adverse impact as described in subsection C.2, below. 
2.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing project, and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing project and existing or planned development in the area where the proposed development will be located. 
3.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the city that will result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. 
B.  Number of Incentives or Concessions. The number of incentives shall be based on the percentage of affordable units in the project: 
1.  One incentive or concession shall be entitled for projects where at least five (5) percent of the total units are for very low income households, ten (10) percent of the total units are for lower income households, or ten (10) percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
2.  Two (2) incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least ten (10) percent of the total units are for very low income households, twenty (20) percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least twenty (20) percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
3.  Three (3) incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least fifteen (15) percent of the total units are for very low income households, thirty (30) percent of the total units are for lower income households, or thirty (30) percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households.

2.  Incentives or concessions may be selected from only one category (very low, lower, or moderate). 
3.  No incentives or concessions are available for land donation. 
_____
C.  Findings to Deny Incentive or Concession. The city shall grant the incentive or concession requested by the applicant unless the city makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of any of the following: 
1.  The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for affordable rents for the restricted units; or 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate-income households. A specific adverse impact means a significant, unavoidable impact, as provided in written standards, policies, or conditions; or 
3.  The incentive or concession would be contrary to state or federal law. 
D.  Exceptions. This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the city or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. Nor does any provision of this section require the city to grant an incentive or concession found to have a specific adverse impact. 
E.  Amendment, Zone Change. The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 2834, § 6(Exh. B), 1-14-2014; Ord. No. 2928, § 31, 5-15-2018)  
17.85.080 - Waivers and modifications of development standards. 
A.  Applicants granted a density bonus pursuant to Section 17.85.020 of this article may, by written proposal, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this article. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city to discuss such request for waiver and modifications. 
B.  In order to obtain a waiver or modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 17.85.020 of this article, at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this article. 
C.  A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to Section 17.85.070 of this article. 
D.  The city may deny a request for any waiver, modification or reduction of development standards if the wavier, modification or reduction would have a specific adverse impact. 
(Ord. No. 2834, § 6(Exh. B), 1-14-2014)  
17.85.090 - Parking incentives. 
Upon the written request of the applicant for a housing development meeting the criteria for a density bonus under Section 17.85.020 of this article, the city shall not require a vehicular parking ratio that exceeds the following: 
A.  Zero to one bedroom units: One on-site parking space. 
B.  Two (2) to three (3) bedroom units: Two (2) on-site parking spaces. 
C.  Four (4) and more bedroom units: Two and one-half (2½) parking spaces. 
Guest parking and handicapped parking shall be included within the maximum number of spaces that may be required.

The purpose of this Chapter 17.88 is to establish an overlay zone where new billboards may be constructed and existing billboards may be relocated and constructed subject to reasonable controls, while recognizing that community appearance is an important factor in ensuring the general community welfare. 
B.  1.  "Agreement" means a development agreement, by and between the applicant and the city, in accordance with the Development Agreement Law (Gov. Code, § 65864 et seq.) and El Monte Municipal Code Chapter 17.84 (Development Agreements). Such development agreement, as necessary, may also constitute a "relocation agreement," pursuant to California Business and Professions Code Section 5412, and may include compensation to be paid to the city or the provision of other public benefits to be provided as a result of the installation and operation of any billboard or modification of an existing billboard within the freeway overlay zone.

Q.  Payments. That the grantee shall, during the life of the franchise, pay to the city in lawful money of the United States, the two (2) percent of the gross annual receipts of such grantee arising from the use, operation or possession of said franchise, as required by law.

If said bond be not so filed, the award of the franchise will be set aside, and any money paid therefor will be forfeited. In the event that said bond after it has been so filed shall, at any time during the life of the franchise, become insufficient, the grantee of the franchise, by accepting the terms and conditions thereof, agrees to renew said bond with good and sufficient sureties within ten (10) days after written notice so to do from the Council.

Chapter 18.08 - CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISES* 
Sections: 
 
18.08.010 - PurposeFindings. 
The city of El Monte, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized to grant one or more non-exclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct cable systems within the city's territorial limits. 
The City Council finds that the development of cable systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable systems, the City Council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City Council or such persons as the City Council may designate. It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable service to the public. Any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include these findings. It is the further intent of this chapter to establish regulatory provisions that permit the City Council to regulate all cable system franchises granted by the City Council after the effective date of this chapter, to the extent permitted by federal and state law, including but not limited to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable FCC regulations and applicable California law.

Where electric and telephone utilities are to be placed underground in any new residential housing developments, grantor and the developer of such new residential housing shall give each grantee serving the franchise area within which the new residential housing development is located at least five (5) days prior written notice of the date on which open trenching will be available for grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and vaults (or such other prior written notice required by the City Engineer). On request of grantor or a developer, grantee shall provide specifications needed for trenching. Developers of new residential housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two (2) cable systems and dedicate the use of such conduit to the city. 
3.  Grantor may require that any nonincumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in grantor's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables, lines, conduit, or other cable system infrastructure. 
(Ord. 2509 § 3, 2000)

In the event that the applicant does not satisfy the informational requirements within this sixty (60)-day period, the City Council may deny the application. 
C.  Initial Franchise Application Process. 
1.  Upon receipt of any complete application for an initial franchise, the City Manager shall prepare a report and make recommendations respecting such application to the City Council. 
2.  A public hearing shall be set prior to any initial franchise grant, at a time and date approved by the City Council. Within sixty (60) days after the close of the hearing, the City Council shall make a decision, based upon the evidence received at the hearing, as to whether or not the initial franchise(s) should be granted, and, if granted, the conditions attached to the grant of the franchise. The City Council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
D.  Franchise Renewal Application and Process. 
1.  If grantee intends to initiate a formal franchise renewal process under Section 626(a)-(g) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g)), grantee must notify grantor at least thirty (30) months and no more than thirty-six (36) months before the franchise expiration date. When grantor receives a formal franchise renewal notice from grantee, or at any time at grantor's own initiative, grantor shall take the following actions: 
a.  Review and evaluate the future cable-related community needs and interests and grantee's past performance with respect to the franchise it has received from the city. The review and evaluation shall include an opportunity for public comment, in a manner and forum determined by the City Council. 
b.  On completion of grantor's initial review and evaluation, notify grantee that it may file the initial renewal application fee and a franchise renewal application, including the renewal proposal referenced in Section 626(b) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546(b)). The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application. The application filing deadline shall not be earlier than thirty (30) days after the date of this notice. If grantee does not submit a reasonably complete renewal application by the specified date, the franchise may not be renewed under Sections 4.4(a)-4.4(e) of this chapter or Sections 626(a)-(g) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g)). 
c.  Hold one or more public hearings on the renewal application after a complete application is received or provide some other procedure for public comment on the application. 
d.  After the public hearing or comment period, the City Manager shall recommend to the City Council that it either: 
i.  Renew the franchise, subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to grantor and grantee; or 
ii.  Issue a preliminary decision that the franchise should not be renewed. 
e.  The City Council's formal response to the City Manager's recommendation described in subsection (D)(1)(d) of this section shall be taken within four (4) months of the date of the city's receipt of a complete franchise renewal application described in subsection (D)(1)(b) of this section. 
2.  In preliminarily considering a renewal application, grantor shall consider whether: 
a.  The cable operator has substantially complied with the material provisions of the existing franchise agreement, including all applicable law; 
b.  The quality of the cable operator's service, including signal quality, response to subscriber complaints, and billing practices has been reasonable in light of community needs (but without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the cable system); 
c.  The cable operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment described in the franchise renewal application; and 
d.  The cable operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting the needs and interests. 
3.  If the City Council preliminarily decides that a franchise should not be renewed; at the request of grantee or on its own initiative, grantor shall commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546(c)). 
a.  The City Council shall begin a public hearing within sixty (60) days of the City Council's issuance of its preliminary decision. Prior to this hearing, the City Council shall provide the franchise renewal applicant written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing by causing such notice to be delivered to the applicant by personal service or by mailing a copy of the notice thereof, postage prepaid. 
b.  i.  The City Council need not conduct this hearing according to the technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence about which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, including hearsay evidence, provided that such evidence alone shall be insufficient to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. The City Council may prevent the introduction of irrelevant evidence. 
ii.  At this hearing, the City Council shall hear oral evidence taken only on oath or affirmation. The City Council may take official notice of any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts of this state or of official records of departments and ordinances of the city, provided that the parties are informed of the matters to be noticed, the matters are noted in the record, and the parties are given a reasonable opportunity to refute the officially noticed matters. 
iii.  Each party to this hearing shall be entitled to the following procedural rights: 
(A)  To call and examine witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; 
(B)  To introduce documentary and physical evidence; 
(C)  To cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues of the hearing; 
(D)  To impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify; 
(E)  To rebut the evidence; and 
(F)  To be represented by anyone who is lawfully permitted to provide such representation. 
iv.  This hearing may continue from time to time. 
v.  Grantor shall ensure that a record of this hearing shall be made and duly preserved, provided that the franchise renewal applicant reimburse the city for the total cost of preparing such a record before a copy of the record is made available to the applicant. 
c.  Within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall issue a recommended decision consistent with the Cable Act. Parties to the hearing and the public shall have thirty (30) days after the recommended decision is issued to provide written comments to the City Council. The City Council shall grant or deny an application within sixty (60) calendar days after the deadline for receipt of these written comments. 
4.  The City Council shall hold a public hearing on any negotiated renewed franchise agreement prior to final City Council action on the franchise. 
5.  Notwithstanding subsections (D)(1) through (4) of this section, granteeno later than twenty-four (24) months before the franchise expiration datemay submit an application for renewal of a franchise, pursuant to Section 626(h) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 546(h)). The initial filing fee described in subsection A of this section, shall accompany this application. Grantor shall hold one or more public hearings or provide some other procedure for public comment on the proposal. After the public hearing or comment period, the City Manager shall recommend that the City Council grant or deny the franchise renewal and the terms and conditions of any recommended renewal. 
6.  If grantor denies the renewal of a franchise, grantor may, on the recommendation of the City Manager and with the approval of the City Council, acquire ownership of the cable system or transfer ownership of the cable system to another person. Any acquisition or transfer under this subsection shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. 
7.  If grantor does not renew a franchise and grantor does not buy the cable system, grantor may require that grantee remove its cable system facilities and equipment and/or continue providing cable service, in accordance with Section 18.08.140(C) of this chapter. 
E.  Timely Satisfaction of a Final Franchise Application Fee, Surety, Bond and Insurance Requirements After the Granting of a Franchise. 
1.  To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, every grant of an initial or renewed franchise is subject to a final franchise application fee in an amount not to exceed grantor's costs in considering the application, less the amount of the initial filing fee described in subsection A of this section. Within thirty (30) days of the date the grant of the franchise is approved or denied by the City Council, the city shall notify the applicant of the amount of the final franchise application fee and the basis thereof. If the final franchise application fee is not paid within thirty (30) days of the date the city notifies the applicant of this amount, any franchise granted shall become null and void. Neither the initial filing fee described in subsection A of this section nor the final franchise application fee shall constitute a franchise fee nor be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor. 
2.  Before a grant of a franchise may be effective, the applicant must demonstrate to the city that the applicant has satisfied all surety, bond, insurance, and similar provisions contained in this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 2509 § 4, 2000)  
18.08.050 - Transfers and assignments of a franchise or control over a franchise require the city's written consent. 
A.  The City's Prior Written Consent Is Required Before the Sale, Assignment, or Transfer of a Franchise. A franchise and any rights or obligations of the grantee under the franchise shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, leased or sublet, either in whole or in part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right or interest therein (other than a mortgage or other security interest, as provided in subsection L of this section), pass to or vest in any person without prior written consent of the City Council, which shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. 
B.  Ownership or Control of Grantee Also Shall Not Be Transferred Without the Prior Written Consent of the City Council. Ownership or control of grantee also shall not be transferred without the prior written consent of the City Council. 
C.  Grantee's Application and Initial Application Fee. 
1.  Grantee shall promptly notify the city of any action or proposed action requiring consent of the City Council pursuant to this section. 
2.  Grantee shall submit to the City Council an original application and four (4) copies, unless otherwise directed, which application shall fully describe the terms and conditions of the action or proposed action subject to this section and clearly state the basis on which the application should be approved. Application shall also contain all documentation and information required by subsections D and E of this section, and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable initial application fee of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). This application fee shall not constitute a franchise fee or be charged against franchise fees owed the city. 
3.  At any time during this review process, the city reserves the right to require that grantee or any other person involved in the action or proposed action under review provide to the city information or documentation in addition to that required under subsections D and E of this section. Grantee or such other person shall provide all reasonably requested assistance to the city in connection with any such inquiry and, as appropriate, shall secure the cooperation and assistance of all other persons involved in such action. 
4.  The City Council shall render a final decision on an application requiring the city's consent under this section within one hundred twenty (120) days after the city's receipt of a fully complete application (including all initial information required by the city under this chapter and the grantee's franchise agreement), provided that: (i) if the city brings any deficiencies in the original application to the attention of the applicant(s) within thirty (30) days of the city's receipt of the original application, the running of this one hundred twenty (120)-day period shall not begin until the city's receipt of all information requested by the city; or (ii) if the city brings such deficiencies to the applicant's/applicants' attention after this thirty (30)-day period, and the applicant(s) does/do not deliver to the city the requested information within ten (10) days of being notified of these informational deficiencies, the running of this one hundred twenty (120)-day period shall not begin until the city's receipt of all information requested by the city. In the event that the city requests additional information after this thirty (30)-day period, the applicant(s) shall be required to deliver this information to the city within ten (10) days of being notified by the city; provided that this ten (10)-day deadline is met, the deadline for a final decision by the city shall be one hundred twenty (120) days after the city's receipt of an applicationeven if originally incomplete. Additionally, the City Council and an applicant may mutually agree to an extension of this deadline for a final decision. 
An application for the city's consent to the types of transactions described in this section shall be deemed approved if the City Council fails to render a final decision on the application by the deadline required in this paragraph or a mutually agreed deadline. However, the City Council may deny such an application, due to, among other grounds: (i) a grantee's failure to submit the information required by this section; (ii) grantee's inability or refusal to correct existing deficiencies in grantee's performance of its franchise agreement obligations brought to its attention by the city, prior to the City Council granting its approval of the application; or (iii) the inability or refusal of a proposed successor in interest to the franchise to provide prior written assurances satisfactory to the city concerning the timely and full correction of any existing deficiencies in a grantee's performance of its franchise obligations. 
D.  Contents of an Initial Application. 
1.  In an initial application, a proposed assignee or transferee must demonstrate that it possesses the legal, financial and technical qualifications necessary to perform all the terms, conditions and obligations under the grantee's franchise agreement for the remaining term thereof, and such reasonable additional obligations required of the proposed assignee or transferee by the City Council for the specific and limited purpose of assuring the performance by the proposed assignee or transferee of all the terms, conditions and obligations of the franchise agreement. Consequently, in an initial application, a proposed assignee or transferee must provide the following information: 
a.  Legal Qualifications. The application shall identify the proposed assignee or transferee and, if the proposed assignee or transferee is not a natural person, each of its officers, directors or shareholders owning or beneficially holding five (5) percent or more of its outstanding voting shares, general partners and limited partners holding an equity interest in the proposed assignee or transferee of five (5) percent or more, and the respective percentage share of each such identified officer, director, shareholder or general or limited partner. The proposed assignee or transferee shall disclose any pending litigation or finding made or final action taken during the past five (5) years by, any court, administrative body or arbitrator, concerning the proposed assignee, transferee or officers, directors, or other persons having a legal or equitable interest in five (5) percent or more of the voting stock of such transferee or assignee in a civil, criminal, administrative or FCC proceeding brought under the provisions of any law or regulation related to the following: any felony; revocation, suspension or involuntary transfer of any authorization (including a cable franchise) to provide video programming or other communications services; antitrust or unfair competition; fraudulent statements to a governmental unit; material breach of a cable franchise agreement, including but not limited to a material failure to provide PEG access channels, facilities or equipment. 
b.  Financial Qualifications. The proposed assignee or transferee must demonstrate that it has sufficient net liquid assets on hand or available specifically committed to consummate the transaction and operate the grantee's cable system for a continuing period of six (6) months. The franchise transfer of assignment application shall include recent financial statements (including audited financial statements if requested by the city), of the proposed assignee or transferee prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including balance sheets, income and expense statements, capital expenditure statements and accompanying notes for the past five (5) years. Such statements, if not otherwise publicly available, may be designated as confidential and shall be maintained as such by the city to the extent permissible under state and local law. 
c.  Technical Qualifications. The application shall set forth a narrative account of the proposed assignee's or transferee's technical qualifications, experience and expertise regarding cable systems. The narrative account shall include, but not be limited to, a, list of the cable systems currently and formerly owned or operated by assignee or transferee within the past three (3) years, summary information concerning appropriate management personnel who will be involved in the management and operation of the proposed assignee's or transferee's cable system, a list of any adjudications of material violations of the technical rules of the FCC or of federal, state or local governments, including but not limited to violations of rules or regulations regarding signal quality, safety and constriction during the past five (5) years. 
d.  Customer Service. The applicant must submit to the city: (i) a reasonably detailed narrative or a representative manual (if such a manual exists) describing assignee or transferee's customer service procedures; (ii) copies of at least two (2) representative annual customer notices provided by other cable systems owned or operated by assignee or transferee; (iii) a summary of assignee or transferee's proposed billing procedures; (iv) a sample customer service bill; and (v) a copy of a representative or sample customer service agreement or work order which assignee or transferee has used in other cable systems owned or operated by assignee or transferee or which assignee or transferee proposes to use in grantee's cable system. 
2.  The proposed assignee or transferee must agree to comply with all provisions of the grantee's franchise agreement and applicable provisions of this chapter, as well as such reasonable additional terms and conditions as the City Council may require for the specific and limited purpose of assuring the proposed assignee's or transferee's compliance with such provisions. 
E.  Grantee Shall Promptly Notify the City of Any Actual or Prospective Change in Control of a Franchise: Grantee and the Proposed Assignee or Transferee Shall Assist the City in the City's Review of Any Actual or Contemplated Change in Control of a Franchise. 
1.  Grantee's Responsibility. Grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or prospective change in the control of a franchise. Grantee shall assist the city in its inquiry into an assignee's or transferee's capabilities concerning the qualifications addressed in subsection D of this section. 
2.  Proposed Assignee's or Transferee's Responsibility. In seeking the City Council's consent to any change in ownership or control, assignee or transferee shall have the responsibility to establish, to the satisfaction of the City Council, that an assignee or transferee has all the legal, financial and technical qualifications necessary to perform all of the terms, conditions and obligations of the grantee under its franchise agreement for the remaining term thereof. The city may request, and assignee or transferee shall provide, all reasonable financial data relative to the transfer, including but not limited to the materials specified in subsection D of this section. In addition, assignee or transferee shall provide to the city the terms and conditions of the sale, credit agreements, partnership agreements and any other information reasonably related to the assignee's or transferee's acquisition of the grantee's franchise which is needed to demonstrate the qualifications of the assignee or transferee. 
F.  Transfer of Franchise Control Occurs with a Change of the Person Exercising Management Authority Over Grantee or with the Obtainment of a Twenty Percent or Greater Change in Voting or Equity Interest by a Person Who Previously Did Not Have an Interest of this Magnitude. 
1.  The word "control," as used in this section is not limited to major stockholders but includes de facto control (as more specifically set forth in this subsection or significant influence with respect to the operation of the grantee's cable system. For purposes of this section, "significant influence" occurs where a person other than grantee or a person controlling, controlled by or under common control with grantee exercises working or effective control of decisions affecting the operation of the cable system. 
2.  A presumption that transfer of control has occurred, including transfer of control in fact (i.e., transfer of de facto control), shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons, of twenty (20) percent of the voting interest or the equity interest of a publicly held grantee or of the person exercising management authority over such a publicly held grantee, or of twenty (20) percent of the voting interest or the equity interest of a privately held grantee or of the person exercising management authority over such a privately held grantee, where the person or group of persons previously did not such a twenty (20) percent interest. 
G.  A Franchise Transfer Without the City Council's Prior Consent Shall Be a Material Breach, and May Result in the Imposition of Liquidated Damages. 
1.  Any assignment of a franchise or transfer of ownership or control of grantee without the prior consent of the City Council shall be null and void unless later ratified by the City Council and: (i) shall be deemed a material breach of a franchise agreement and (ii) among and/or in addition to other remedies available to the city, shall be subject to a liquidated damages assessment of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per week from the date of the unauthorized transaction until the City Council approves the franchise assignment or transfer in ownership or control, or if not approved, until the prior ownership, control or other status quo ante is restored to a condition satisfactory to the City Council. 
H.  The City Council May Revoke a Franchise if an Unauthorized Franchise Transfer or Change in Control Occurs. If the City Council fails to approve or denies its consent to an assignment of a franchise or transfer of ownership or control of grantee requiring the city's approval and such action has nevertheless been effected, the City Council may revoke said franchise and terminate any applicable franchise agreement unless control of the grantee or the cable system is promptly restored to its status prior to such unauthorized action or to a status acceptable to the City Council. 
I.  Consent of the City Council to a Franchise Transfer or Change in Control Shall Not Constitute a Waiver of the City's Rights. The consent or approval of the City Council to any assignment of a franchise or transfer of control of a franchise or of its ownership shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city unless the City Council specifically releases or waives such rights. In no event shall such a consent or approval result in an estoppel, release, or waiver of any power vested in the city or the waiver of the right to exercise such vested power. 
J.  A Successor-In-Interest to a Franchise Must Become a Signatory to the Applicable Franchise Agreement or an Amended Franchise Agreement Satisfactory to the City. In no event shall an assignment of franchise be approved without the successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the existing franchise agreement or an amended franchise agreement satisfactory to the City Council. 
K.  A Grantee Shall Not Enter into Any Management Contract Resulting in a Change in Control Without the Prior Consent of the City Council. Grantee shall not enter into any management contract or other arrangement for the management of the cable system, to the extent that such contract or other arrangement would result in a significant change of de facto control over the operations of a grantee or the cable system (as defined herein), without the prior consent of the City Council. 
L.  Provided Certain Conditions Are Met, Certain Circumstances or Transactions Pertaining to Franchise Transfers or Changes in Control Shall Not Require the City's Prior Consent. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, any financial institution having a pledge of grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the cable system shall have the right and obligation to notify grantor that the financial institution or a designee satisfactory to grantor shall take control of and operate the cable system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. However, said financial institution shall also agree in writing to continue cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the cable system. Furthermore: 
1.  The granting of a security interest in any grantee assets, or any mortgage, hypothecation, or assignment of any right, title or interest in the cable system, or use of the cable system as collateral in order to secure indebtedness, shall not require the consent of the City Council; and 
2.  The consent of the City Council shall not be required for an intracorporate or intracompany transfer from one wholly-owned subsidiary of a franchisee to another wholly-owned subsidiary of the same franchisee. However, in the event that a parent of a franchisee desires to transfer a franchise to another subsidiary, the City Council may require a written guarantee from the parent stating that the parent will be ultimately responsible for the performance of all franchise agreement obligations. 
M.  Reimbursement Due Grantor for Its Review of Any Franchise Assignment or Franchise Change in Control: Transaction Not Effective with Respect to the Franchise Until Successor-In-Interest Has Satisfied All Applicable Surety, Bond, Insurance, and Similar Franchise Agreement Provisions. 
1.  Prior to the effective date of a franchise transfer, assignment, or change in control, grantee shall reimburse grantor for grantors processing and review expenses related to the transaction, including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation expenses, to the extent the sum of these expenses exceeds the initial application fee described in subsection C of this section. Neither such reimbursement nor the initial application fee described in subsection C of this section shall constitute a franchise fee or be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor. 
2.  Before a franchise transfer or change in control may be effective, the successor-in-interest must demonstrate to the city that the successor-in-interest has satisfied all surety, bond, insurance, and similar provisions contained in the applicable franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 2509 § 5, 2000)  
18.08.060 - Minimum customer protection and service standards. 
A.  Operational Standards. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, grantee shall maintain the following necessary facilities, equipment and personnel to comply with the following customer protection and service standards under normal operating conditions: 
a.  Grantee shall obtain and maintain sufficient telephone lines and staffing so as not to delay unreasonably the answering of any telephone call, and shall adjust grantee's staffing, as necessary, with respect to special events which may reasonably be expected to increase call volume. Trained customer service representatives shall be available to respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours, defined as not less than nine (9) hours per business day, Monday through Friday, and some evening hours, at least one night per week, and/or some weekend hours. Grantee shall connect a telephone caller within thirty (30) seconds after the caller dials and "ringing" begins. This standard shall be deemed satisfied when a connection is made either to an automated attendant capable of responding to the subscriber's inquiry, such as an automatic response unit, or to a customer service representative capable of responding to the subscriber's inquiry. Under normal operating conditions, the caller will receive a busy signal less than three (3) percent of the time. If the call needs to be transferred, if the caller needs to be placed on hold, or if the caller wishes to be transferred, such transfer or hold time shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds. Each of the standards set forth in this paragraph shall be met no less than ninety (90) percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis, under normal operating conditions, as noted in subsection (A)(2) of this section. 
b.  Emergency toll free telephone line capacity on a twenty-four (24) hour basis, including weekends and holidays. After normal business hours, the telephone calls may be answered by a service or an automated response system, including an answering machine. Calls received after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained company representative no later than the next business day. During periods when an answering service or machine is used, grantee shall provide on-call personnel who shall contact the answering service or machine, at a minimum, every four hours to check on requests for service or complaints. 
c.  A reasonably accessible local business and service and/or payment office, open during normal business hours, where grantee provides adequate staffing to accept subscriber payments and respond to service requests and complaints. grantee may petition grantor to reduce its business hours if the extended hours are not justified by subscriber demand, and grantor may not unreasonably deny the petition. 
d.  An emergency cable system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing any major cable system malfunction on a twenty-four (24) hour per day basis. 
e.  An installation staff, capable of installing service to any subscriber requiring a standard installation within seven (7) days after receipt of a request, in all areas where trunk and feeder cable have been activated. 
i.  "Standard installation" charges shall apply to those installations which consist of an aerial or underground drop of no more than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet in length, running from the nearest feeder cable of the cable system to a subscriber terminal, using exposed wiring inside the subscriber's premises. Installations which exceed this maximum length, or in the case of an underground dropwhich involves unforeseen or extraordinary conditionswill be subject to additional charges, as determined grantee, provided that such additional charges shall be fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. 
ii.  All installations shall include the proper grounding of grantee's equipment, the correct adjustment of any television set or other customer equipment connected to the cable system, either directly or indirectly, in order to receive service, and the provision of required customer information and literature instructing customers in the use of grantee's services. 
f.  Grantee shall schedule, within a specified four (4) hour time period during normal business hours, all appointments with subscribers for installation of service, service calls and other activities at the subscriber location. Grantee may schedule installation and service calls outside of normal business hours for the convenience of the customer. Grantee shall not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a grantee representative is running late for an appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, grantee shall contact customer and the appointment shall be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer. 
2.  Under normal operating conditions, the standards of subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section shall be met not less than ninety (90) percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. The standards of subsections (A)(1)(d) through (f) of this section shall be met not less than ninety-five (95) percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. 
3.  Grantee shall not be required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards above unless an historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply with these standards. 
B.  Service Standards. 
1.  Grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest periods of time possible. Scheduled interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during a period of minimum use of the cable system, preferably between midnight and six a.m. local time. 
2.  Grantee shall maintain a repair force of technicians normally capable of responding to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames: 
a.  For a Cable System Outage. Within two (2) hours, including weekends, of receiving subscriber calls or requests for service which by number identify a cable system outage of sound or picture of one or more channels, affecting at least ten (10) percent of the subscribers of the cable system. 
b.  For an Isolated Outage. Within twenty-four (24) hours, including weekends, of receiving requests for service identifying an isolated outage of sound or picture for one or more channels that affects five (5) or more subscribers, except as provided in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section. An outage affecting fewer than five (5) subscribers shall result in a service call no later than the next business day. 
c.  For Inferior Signal Quality. Within two (2) business days of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality. 
3.  Grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this section when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. In the case of a subscriber not being home when the technician arrives, the technician shall leave written notification of arrival. 
4.  Grantee shall not charge for the repair or replacement of defective or malfunctioning equipment provided by grantee to subscribers, unless the defect was caused by the subscriber, or connected equipment owned by the subscriber requires repair or replacement and grantee has not been responsible for the need for this repair or replacement. 
5.  Unless excused, grantee shall determine the nature of the problem resulting in a request for service within two (2) business days of beginning work and resolve all cable system related problems within five (5) business days unless technically infeasible. 
C.  Billing and Information Standards. 
1.  Subscriber bills shall be clear, concise and understandable. Bills shall be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges.

2.  In case of a billing dispute, grantee shall respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within thirty (30) days. 
3.  Grantee shall automatically provide credits or refunds to such subscribers whose service has been interrupted for twenty-four (24) consecutive hours or more, and upon request to subscribers whose service has been interrupted for two (2) or more hours. 
Credits or refunds shall automatically be provided by grantee on a pro rata basis to any subscriber(s) affected by interruption(s) of service for more than two (2) hours due to actions or outages under the control of grantee, exclusive of scheduled repairs, maintenance or franchise-required construction for which grantee has provided advance written notice of to subscribers. In cases where advance written notice is provided to subscribers, the time period detailed in said notice shall not exceed four (4) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period. In cases where said notice has been given to subscribers and the service interruption exceeds the period detailed in said notice, grantee shall provide pro rata credits or refunds to subscribers. 
In the event grantee has improperly or inadvertently disconnected cable services to a subscriber, grantee shall provide for restoration of cable service without charge to the subscriber as soon as possible, but no later than within two (2) days of grantee's discovery of the impropriety or inadvertence of said disconnection. Grantee shall provide a pro rata credit or a pro rata refund reflecting the period of time without cable service to any subscriber improperly or inadvertently disconnected from such service. 
All credits or refunds for service shall be issued no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. For subscribers terminating service, refunds shall be issued promptly, but no later than thirty (30) days after the return of any grantee-supplied equipment. 
4.  Grantee shall provide written information on each of the following areas (i) at the time of the installation of service, (ii) at least annually to all subscribers, and (iii) at any time upon request: 
a.  Products and services offered; 
b.  Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services; 
c.  Installation and service maintenance policies; 
d.  Instructions on how to use the cable service; and 
e.  Channel positions of programming carried on the cable system; and 
f.  Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of grantor's office(s) designated for dealing with cable service issues. 
5.  Grantee shall provide written notification to subscribers of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions, as soon as possible and in accordance with state and federal law. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of such a change if the change is within the control of grantee. In addition, grantee shall notify subscribers thirty (30) days in advance of any significant changes in the information required in subsection (C)(4) of this section. 
6.  Where the changes described in subsection (C)(5) of this section, are within grantee's control; grantee shall deliver to the City Manager draft copies of all subscriber notices described in subsection (C)(5) of this section, for the city's review and comment, prior to the finalization of these notices and at least fifteen (15) days prior to distribution of such notices to subscribers. 
7.  Notices of changes in rates, programming services or channel positions or other customer information that are not within grantee's control shall be submitted to the city for review and comment as soon as practicable, allowing the city as much lead-time as possible prior to finalization of the notices. This submission of notices to the city must always take place prior to the distribution of such notices to subscribers. 
D.  Verification of Compliance with Customer Service Standards. 
1.  Upon ten (10) days prior written notice, grantee shall respond to a request for information made by grantor regarding grantee's compliance with any or all of the standards required in subsections A, B and C of this section. Grantee shall provide sufficient documentation to permit grantor to verify grantee's compliance. 
2.  A repeated and verifiable pattern of non-compliance with the customer protection standards of subsections A, B and C of this section, after grantee's receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement. 
3.  In order to determine whether sufficient telephone lines are provided, grantor may require that a busy study, traffic study or other study be conducted, at grantee's expense, if any, by the local telephone company. Should grantee have its own telephone equipment which can report on telephone line(s) usage, grantee may submit such a report generated by its own system. Grantor, pursuant to subsection (A)(3) of this section, may require grantee to acquire equipment to determine compliance with the telephone answering standards of this section. 
4.  Grantee shall take necessary steps to ensure that adequate telephone lines and/or staffing are available to permit grantee to satisfy its obligations under this chapter and the franchise agreement. Consideration shall be given for periods of promotional activities or outages. The monthly billing period shall be considered as a normal, daily activity for purposes of determining the availability of adequate telephone lines and/or staffing. 
E.  Subscriber Complaints and Disputes. 
1.  Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing. Grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with grantor. The written procedures shall include a requirement that grantee resolve, if reasonably possible, any written complaint from a subscriber concerning billing within thirty (30) days of grantee's receipt of said complaint. 
2.  Upon prior written request, grantor shall have the right to review grantee's response to any subscriber complaints in order to determine grantee's compliance with franchise requirements. Grantee shall not be required to release any "individually identifiable" or "personally identifiable" information to grantor, except as provided by state or federal law, or unless, and to the extent, allowed by a subscriber or complainant affected by such a disclosure. 
3.  Subject to applicable law, it shall be the right of any subscriber to continue receiving cable service provided that he or she meets his or her financial and other obligations to grantee. In the event that grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the cable system, or grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive cable service so long as the franchise remains in force. 
4.  In the event of a change of ownership or control of grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the cable system, the original grantee shall cooperate with grantor, the new grantee or the new operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the cable system. 
5.  Grantee response to subscriber complaints, as well as complaints made by subscribers to grantor and provided by grantor to grantee, shall be initiated within one business day of receipt by grantor. The resolution of subscriber complaints shall be effected by grantee not later than three (3) business days after receipt of the complaint. Should a grantee supervisor not be available when requested by a subscriber, a supervisor shall respond to the subscriber's complaint at the earliest possible time, and in no event later than the end of the next business day. For complaints received by grantor and provided by grantor to grantee, grantee shall periodically inform grantor in writing of grantee's progress in responding to, and resolving, said complaints. 
F.  Other Customer Service Requirements. 
1.  In the event grantee fails to operate the cable system for seven (7) consecutive days for reasons not excused under Section 18.08.130 of this chapter, without prior approval or subsequent excuse of grantor, grantor may, at its sole option, operate the cable system or designate an operator until such time as grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to grantor or a permanent replacement operator is selected. If grantor should fulfill this obligation for grantee, then during such period as grantor fulfills such obligation, grantor shall be entitled to collect all revenues from the cable system, and grantee shall reimburse grantor for all costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by grantor that are the result of grantee's failure to perform. 
2.  All officers, agents or employees of grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers' premises shall carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by grantor. Grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. All vehicles of grantee or its major subcontractors shall clearly indicate on the outside of the vehicles their affiliation with grantee. 
3.  Additional service standards and standards governing customer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance, which shall become incorporated into the franchise agreement. The city may deem a pattern of noncompliance with the customer service standards included in this chapter or any applicable franchise agreement a material breach of the franchise agreement. However, prior to imposing any sanction, the city shall afford grantee due process as described in this chapter, including prior written notification, a reasonable opportunity to cure, and a public hearing.

18.08.070 - Franchise fee and other financial requirements. 
A.  Franchise Fee. 
1.  Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, grantee shall pay to grantor franchise fees equal to the greater of: (i) five (5) percent of grantee's gross annual cable service revenues, as defined in Section 18.08.020 of this chapter; or (ii) the maximum franchise fees allowed by law if changes in applicable law increase the maximum franchise fee percentage applicable to these gross annual cable service revenues. 
2.  On an annual basis, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the close of each calendar year, grantee shall provide to grantor a written statement reflecting the total amounts of gross annual cable service revenues and all franchise fee payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by these franchise fee payments. Grantee shall ensure that this gross revenues/franchise fee statement is either audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant or certified by an officer of grantee, under penalty of perjury. Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent financial audit of grantee's gross annual cable service revenues and franchise fee records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) as well as generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). If such an audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of two (2) percent or more, grantee shall reimburse grantor for its costs resulting from such an audit. 
3.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by grantor shall be construed as a release, an accord and satisfaction, or a waiver of any claim grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as franchise fees under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of grantee. 
4.  In the event that any franchise fee payment or payment of any adjustment to any franchise fee is not made on or before the due date(s) specified in the franchise agreement or this chapter; unless otherwise excused by grantor, grantee shall pay: 
a.  An interest charge, computed from such due date(s), at an annual rate equal to the highest of the most recently published prime lending rate of any of the five (5) largest member banks of the New York Clearing House Association, plus one percent beginning on the due date(s) and continuing for any period for which a payment was late; and 
b.  If a payment is late by thirty (30) days or more, a sum of money equal to five (5) percent of the amount due, in order to defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by grantor as a result of grantee's delinquent payment. 
5.  Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement. 
B.  A Five Percent Fee Also Applies to Any Non-Cable Operator or Non-Grantee Person Distributing a Service Over the Cable System. Consistent with Section 622(h) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542(h)) and subparagraph (1)(g) of the "grantor" definition in Section 18.08.020, the city shall have the power to require any person, other than a cable operator, who originates or controls the distribution of any service over the cable system and receives fees for such service, which fees are not received by or transmitted through the cable operator, to pay the city a fee equal to five (5) percent or the maximum permitted by law of the gross revenues of such person derived from the distribution of such service over the cable system, less any amounts directly paid to the cable operator or grantee in compensation for the use of such cable system. 
C.  Security Fund. 
1.  Grantor may require grantee to provide a security fund, in an amount and form established in the franchise agreement. The amount of the security fund shall be designed to secure grantee's obligations under the terms of the franchise. 
2.  The security fund shall be available to grantor to satisfy all claims, liens, fees, and/or taxes grantee owes grantor and which arise by reason of construction, operation, or maintenance of the cable system, and to satisfy any actual or liquidated damages arising out of a breach or default pertaining to the franchise agreement, subject to the procedures and amounts designated in the franchise agreement. 
3.  If the security fund is drawn upon by grantor in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount no later than thirty (30) days after receiving written confirmation from the bank or other financial institution where such security fund is deposited of this drawing against the security fund. Failure to replenish the security fund shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 2509 § 7, 2000)  
18.08.080 - Cable system construction and technical standards. 
A.  Applicable Cable System Construction Technical Standards. 
1.  Grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its cable system in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, electrical codes, construction standards, governmental requirements, FCC technical standards, and any detailed standards set forth in its franchise agreement. Such applicable electrical codes and construction standards shall include the most current versions of the National Electrical Code (NEC), General Order No. 95 of the state of California's Public Utilities Commission, General Order No. 128 of the state of California's Public Utilities Commission, and the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), to the extent the NESC does not conflict with the NEC or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated by the state of California's Public Utilities Commission. 
2.  Grantee shall provide to grantor, upon written request, a written report of the results of grantee's periodic proof of performance tests and signal leakage tests conducted pursuant to FCC and franchise standards and guidelines. 
3.  Any time the signal provided on grantee's cable system does not meet FCC technical standards or the technical standards of grantee's franchise application and/or grantee's franchise agreement, grantor may order grantee to make a pro rata rebate, in money or services, to each subscriber based upon the percentage by which the signal falls below the most stringent technical standard and upon the length of time that such condition has existed. Grantor shall follow the procedure for addressing franchise agreement violations described in Section 18.08.120(B) of this chapter, before ordering such a rebate. 
B.  Noncompliance with Cable System Construction Technical Standards. Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical standards described or referenced in subsection A of this section, shall constitute a material breach of the franchise agreement. 
C.  Cable System Construction. 
1.  Grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until grantee has secured the necessary permits from grantor, or other responsible public agencies. Grantee shall be subject to all permit and bonding requirements applicable to contractors working within the public rights-of-way. No provision of this chapter or any franchise agreement shall be deemed a waiver of the obligation of a grantee to pay grantor for the issuance of such a permit. Furthermore, permit fees shall not constitute franchise fees nor be charged against franchise fees owed to the city. 
2.  Sixty (60) days and thirty (30) days prior to beginning any construction, rebuild, or upgrade of any cable system within the service area, and every sixty (60) days while engaged in such activity, grantee shall submit construction reports to the City Manager containing the following information: (i) a general description of the construction, rebuild, or upgrade activities to be undertaken by grantee during the following sixty (60) days; (ii) the status of necessary permits; (iii) the number of miles constructed and the number of homes passed as of the date of the report and the number of miles to be constructed and the number of homes to be passed during the sixty (60) days following the report; (iv) any conditions known to grantee which may affect the construction schedule; and (v) any other pertinent information required by the City Manager. Unless otherwise specified by the City Manager, such construction reports shall be required until completion of these cable system construction, upgrade, or rebuild activities, at which point in time grantee shall submit to the City Manager a final report addressing the information described in clauses (i) through (v) of this subsection. 
3.  In those areas of the city where transmission lines or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are underground, grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground. 
4.  In those areas of the city where grantee's cables are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public and/or municipal utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both the telephone and electric power utilities subsequently are placed underground, then grantee likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. 
5.  Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as "structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the public rights-of-way, shall be made under the direction of Public Works Director or a designee, who shall, if the proposed change, extension or construction conforms to the provisions hereof, issue written permits therefor. The height above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the state regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof. 
6.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by grantee shall be located so as not to interfere with the proper use of the public rights-of-way, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said public rights-of-way, and not to materially interfere with existing public and municipal utility installations. 
7.  In the event that any property or improvement of grantor in the public rights-of-way is disturbed or damaged by grantee or any of its contractors, agents or employees in connection with undertaking any and all work pursuant to the rights granted to grantee pursuant to this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee shall promptly, at grantee's sole cost and expense, restore to grantor's satisfaction said property or improvement which was so disturbed or damaged. If such property or improvement shall (within two (2) years of grantee's restoration (or in the case of a street improvement, until the street is resurfaced if resurfaced prior to the expiration of the two (2) years) of the date the restoration was completed) become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require additional restorative work, repair or replacement because of the initial disturbance or damage to the property by grantee, then grantee, as soon as reasonably possible, shall, promptly upon receipt of written notice from grantor and at grantee's sole cost and expense, restore to grantor's satisfaction said property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to time, be established by grantor. 
8.  Prior to commencing any work on the cable system in the public rights-of-way, grantee shall obtain any and all permits, licenses and authorizations lawfully required for such work. If emergency work on the cable system in the public right-of-way is required, grantee shall with all due diligence, seek to obtain any and all such required permits, licenses and authorizations within three (3) working days after commencing such emergency work. Prior to performing any work in the public right-of-way, grantee shall give appropriate notice to the "underground service alert" ("USA"), or any similar type service provider designated by grantor. 
9.  There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the public rights-of-way by grantee in connection with any of the work provided for herein. Grantee shall maintain any barriers, signs and warning signals during any work performed on or about the public rights-of-way or adjacent thereto as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property. 
10.  If grantor lawfully elects to alter or change the grade or location of any public right-of-way, grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by grantor, and in a timely manner, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense. 
11.  Grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any public right-of-way shall be so placed as to comply with all ordinances of grantor. 
12.  In accordance with applicable law, grantee or any utility user of the public rights-of-way may be required by grantor to permit joint use of its poles and/or conduit located in the public rights-of-way, insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of a reasonable rental fee for such usage. In the absence of an agreement regarding such joint use, each party shall be entitled to exercise any rights and defenses provided by applicable law. 
13.  Grantee, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by grantor, shall temporarily raise or lower its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of wires or fixtures shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not less than five (5) business days prior written notice to arrange for the temporary wire or equipment changes. 
14.  Grantee shall have the authority to trim any trees or other natural growth overhanging the public rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees or other natural growth from coming in contact with grantee's wires, cables and other equipment. Grantor may require all trimming of trees and natural growth to be done under its supervision and direction, at the expense of grantee. 
15.  Grantee shall be subject to any and all requirements established by grantor with regard to the placement and screening of grantee's facilities and equipment located in the public rights-of-way. Such requirements may include, but not be limited to, the use of landscaping to screen pedestals and cabinets and the requirement that construction be flush with the natural grade of the surrounding area. 
D.  Multiple Franchises. 
1.  Subject to applicable law, in the event that more than one franchise is awarded, grantor reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the cable operator selected by the resident to provide service. 
2.  Grantor reserves the right to grant an encroachment permit to a cable franchisee applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant's risk, with no recourse against grantor in the event the pending franchise application is not granted. Grantor may require an applicant to provide a separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant's cost. 
3.  If grantor authorizes or permits one or more additional cable systems to operate within the territorial limits of the city, grantor shall do so on condition that any additional cable system franchisee agree to indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse grantor and any existing grantee and any affected utility from and against all costs and expenses incurred in strengthening poles, replacing poles, rearranging attachments, placing facilities underground, and engaging in similar activities related to the construction of an additional cable system in the franchise area. Any existing grantee shall be designated a third party beneficiary of such conditions as are incorporated into the authorization(s) granted by the city to any new grantee.

Upon reasonable written notice and upon the failure of grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any public right-of-way required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of grantor; grantor may cause the work to be commenced and/or completed. Grantor shall provide to grantee an itemized work order setting forth in detail the exact nature of the work completed and the supplies used in such work. Grantee shall pay to grantor its documented costs for such work no later than thirty (30) days after grantee's receipt of an itemized work order. 
C.  Extended Operation and Continuity of Services. Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, grantor may permit grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time. Grantor shall provide any such permission in writing, which shall constitute an extension of the franchise for the term specified in such written permission. Such a franchise extension, however, shall not revive any franchise renewal rights or any other rights grantee may have previously lost, except to the extent explicitly stated in writing by the City Council. 
During such a franchise extension, grantee shall continue to operate the cable system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide to all subscribers the regular cable service and any and all of the related services that may be provided at the time of franchise expiration or revocation.

2.  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the cable system, in whole or in part; grantor may serve notice of revocation upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and privileges of grantee hereunder shall be revoked thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless: 
a.  Grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder, in the manner provided by law; and

1.  Should there be any significant change to the Cable Act, to the federal regulations promulgated thereunder, or to any other federal or state law which expand the city's discretionary powers pertaining to cable television, and which expanded discretionary powers fall outside the purview of the city's police powers or powers of eminent domain and taxation, grantee shall meet at the request of the city and negotiate in good faith concerning any modifications to a franchise agreement which the city may request or be authorized to request or otherwise secure with respect to such a significant change.
