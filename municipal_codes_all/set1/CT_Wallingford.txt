§ 20-1. Concept explained.
The concept of ethics is a field based on the philosophy that standards of conduct can be expressed in
an objective manner consistent with societal considerations and codified into established conventions,
thus generating accepted professional standards of conduct. In applying this concept of ethics to
municipal government, the professional standards of conduct for officials and employees of the Town
of Wallingford are set forth in the Constitution of the United States, federal laws and regulations, the
Constitution and General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, the Town Charter and ordinances and
resolutions of the Town of Wallingford (including this Code of Ethics) and generally accepted societal
norms and conventions for proper and ethical conduct.
§ 20-2. Purpose.
The proper operation of Town government in Wallingford requires that public officials and employees
be independent, impartial and responsible to the people whom they serve; that governmental decisions
and policies be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office and
employment not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to set forth standards of ethical conduct
supplementing existing standards as referenced in § 20-1, to assist public officials and employees in
establishing guidelines for their conduct and to develop and maintain a tradition of responsible and
effective public service. In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established for the Town of
Wallingford the following Code of Ethics.
§ 20-3. Definitions.
As used in this Code of Ethics, the following words or phrases, unless a different meaning is required
by the context or is specifically prescribed, shall have the following meanings:

or their relation is a director, officer or holder of an ownership interest. An unpaid member (but not
a director or officer) of a non-profit entity is exempt from this definition.
INTEREST
Any interest, direct or indirect, which is of financial or personal value to the Town official or
employee which is not common to the interest of other citizens of the Town. Interest shall
include the private interest arising from relations as defined herein or close business
association. Interest shall also include the interest of any subcontractor in any prime contract
with the Town and the interest of any person or his/her immediate family in any corporation,
firm or partnership which has a direct or indirect interest in any transaction with the Town;
"transaction" shall include the offer, sale or furnishing of any real or personal property,
material, supplies or services by any person, directly or indirectly, as vendor, prime contractor,
subcontractor or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Town for a valuable consideration.
A Town official or employee has an indirect interest if they are likely to receive a benefit or
loss (financial or otherwise) as a consequence of a benefit or loss incurred by a relation or
entity closely associated to the person. An indirect interest also exists if the official or
employee has a conflict of duty as a result of a benefit or loss incurred by a relation or closely
associated entity.

indicated to promote the best interest of the Town.

There shall be a Board of Ethics constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Town Charter
of the Town of Wallingford. The Board of Ethics shall have such powers and duties as set forth in
said Charter, this Code and other applicable ordinances and/or state law.
The Board of Ethics shall elect biennially a Chairperson from its own membership, who shall serve
a two-year term beginning on January 1 of each even-numbered year. The Board shall establish
its own rules of procedure, except that rules of procedure governing Subsections D and E below
shall be approved by the Law Department, consistent with this Code. Rules of procedure adopted
by the Board shall be filed with the Town Clerk and available for public inspection. Three members
shall constitute a quorum.
Advisory opinions. The Board shall provide advisory opinions to any Town official or employee
upon their written request regarding the requirements of this Code of Ethics. Upon request of the
official or employee, and only as permitted by law, the Board shall keep the name of the requestor
and any identifying information confidential. In such cases, a redacted opinion shall be made
public.
Investigation by the Board.
Upon receipt of a properly prepared written complaint signed under penalty of false statement
alleging a specific violation of the Town Charter and/or this Code of Ethics and naming the
official involved, the Board shall have the power to investigate such complaint. The Board
shall provide a copy of the complaint to the respondent within five business days of receipt.
The Board shall review the complaint to determine whether or not the allegations, if proven,
would constitute a violation of any provision of the Town Charter and/or this Code of Ethics. If
the Board determines that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to constitute a
violation, the Board shall dismiss the complaint and duly notify the complainant and
respondent.
If the Board determines that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to constitute a violation, the
Board shall proceed with an investigation to determine if there is probable cause. In
conducting its investigation, the Board may obtain any documents and may interview any
witnesses it deems necessary to make a probable cause determination. The Board shall
provide the complainant and respondent the opportunity to be heard at the probable-cause
stage in a manner determined by the Board. The Board may also obtain assistance in its
investigation as deemed necessary.
All complaints, probable-cause investigations and hearings shall be kept confidential by all
parties and the Board prior to a determination of probable cause; the complainant's failure to
maintain the confidentiality of the complaint is cause to dismiss the complaint without
investigation or ruling unless the Board, for good cause shown, determines that the complaint
should not be dismissed. Respondent may waive the confidentiality of the complaint at any
time.
Upon completing its investigation, the Board shall determine if there is probable cause that a
violation occurred and, if so, proceed to a public hearing as provided herein. If the Board
determines that there is no probable cause and dismisses the complaint, the complaint shall
remain confidential in accordance with law unless the confidentiality is waived by the
respondent.
If the Board finds probable cause, it shall make such determination public within two business
days of such determination.
Probable-cause determinations shall be made within 45 days of receipt of the complaint
unless the Board, in its discretion, votes to extend the time for completion.

The Purchasing Agent shall award the proposal to the vendor who will provide the best value
to the Town. The principal consideration shall be the vendor's superior experience and
competence and its ability to provide the highest level of service at a reasonable price.
Special services shall also include employee health insurance and/or third-party administrator
of self-insured plan. Such services shall be the subject of a request for proposal at a time
determined by the Personnel Director but not later than every five years. An award is subject
to compliance with relevant law and collective bargaining agreements.
A Department seeking to use the request for proposal process shall notify the Town Council,
by letter, prior to putting out the bid. The request for proposal process shall be deemed to be
approved by the Town Council unless it votes to object within 30 days of receipt of the notice.
Purchase of services by professional two-part bid.
If the Purchasing Agent determines that qualifications and price should be given equal
consideration, it shall use a two-part submission process.
The two-part bid requires the submittal of Part A and Part B by the bidders in separate
envelopes. Part A shall include, as specified in the bid documents, the bidder qualifications
and proposal for the scope of services. Part B shall include, as specified in the bid
documents, the bidder's proposed price. Part B shall remain unopened until the bidders have
been evaluated and ranked based upon the Part A submittal. After scoring and ranking the
proposals, Part B shall be opened and ranked. The two scores shall be combined and the
award shall be made to the bidder with the highest score.
Purchase of services by qualifications-based selection as prequalification.
The qualification-based selection procedure may be used only with prior approval by the
Purchasing Agent and the Town Council.
A request for qualifications may be utilized in the prequalification of proposers in the purchase
of special or professional services, or bidders in a competitive bidding process, where it is
determined by the Purchasing Department that such services are unique or that the nature of
the project requires selection criteria primarily influenced by the past experience of a proposer
in similar or related projects. Once bidders have been qualified, a request for proposal or
request for bids will be issued.
When a Department wishes to use the qualifications-based selection process to prequalify
bidders, it shall submit a written request to the Purchasing Agent with the rationale for using
this process.
With the approval of the Town Council, the qualifications-based selection process may be
used without the secondary RFP process. If used, a proposal will be accepted based upon
qualifications and negotiations regarding price will occur subsequent to the selection.
Qualifications-based selection process with a request for proposal for school construction projects:
architects and construction managers. Definition: "Qualifications-based selection" means a
method for purchasing architectural and construction managers services by initially pre-qualifying
bidders prior to obtaining a price proposal in accordance with Public Act 08-169, § 17[1]. Such
process initially requires the submission of professional qualifications, demonstrated business
experience, specific project experience, evidence of business integrity, and professional
competence. QBS process is used for prequalification of a pool of not more than four most
responsible qualified proposers. Following the prequalification process, the proposals shall be
evaluated and awarded in accordance with the state statute.

§ 71-15. Impoundment; redemption; destruction; violations and

The Animal Control Officer may take into custody any cat found to be damaging property other
than property of its owner or keeper or causing an unsanitary, dangerous or unreasonably
offensive condition unless such cat can be identified as under the care of its owner or a registered
keeper of feral cats. The officer shall impound such cat at the pound unless, in the opinion of a
licensed veterinarian, the cat is so injured or diseased that it should be destroyed immediately, in
which case the Municipal Animal Control Officer may cause the cat to be mercifully killed by a
licensed veterinarian or disposed of as the State Veterinarian may direct. The Animal Control
Officer shall immediately notify the owner or keeper of any cat so taken, if known, of its
impoundment. If the owner or keeper of any such cat is unknown, the officer shall immediately tag
or employ such other suitable means of identification of the cat as may be approved by the Chief
Canine Control Officer and shall promptly cause a description of such cat to be published once in
the lost and found column of a newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Wallingford.
If such cat is not claimed by and released to the owner within seven days after the date of
publication, the Animal Control Officer, upon finding such cat to be in satisfactory health, may sell
such cat to any person who satisfies such officer that he is purchasing it as a pet and that he can
give it a good home and proper care. The Animal Control Officer may retain possession of such
cat for such additional period of time as he may deem advisable in order to place such cat as a
pet. If, within such period, any cat is not claimed by and released to the owner or keeper or
purchased as a pet, the officer shall cause such cat to be mercifully killed by a licensed
veterinarian or disposed of as the State Veterinarian may direct. No person who so destroys a cat
shall be held criminally or civilly liable therefor.
Any cat captured or impounded under the provisions of Subsection A of this section shall be
redeemed by the owner or keeper thereof, or the agent of such owner or keeper, upon proper
identification and presentation to the Municipal Animal Control Officer of a license, tag or other
means of identification for such cat and upon the payment by such owner or keeper or his agent of
the redemption fee, which is $15, and the cost of advertising incurred under the provisions of

redeem such cat within 24 hours after receiving notification to do so, or, where the owner was
unknown, within 24 hours after notification was effected by means of publication in a newspaper,
such owner or keeper shall pay, in addition to such redemption fee and the cost of advertising, the
amount determined by the Animal Control Officer to be the full cost of detention and care of such
impounded cat. In addition, any owner or keeper of any such impounded cat who fails to redeem
such cat within 120 hours after receiving notification to do so shall have committed an infraction,
payable by a fine of $60.

available properly sequenced numbers for later use.

No. 455.
§ 93-1. Policy declaration.
The Town Council is increasingly concerned about safety and environmental impacts associated with
the open burning of brush and other materials. To seek to ensure that the health and safety of its
residents is safeguarded, the Town Council, pursuant to the authority of Section 7-148 and Section
22a-174 of the Connecticut General Statutes, hereby enacts legislation prohibiting all open burning
except as noted.
§ 93-2. Prohibition.
Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall set, cause or permit an open fire within the limits of the
Town of Wallingford. As used herein, "person" means an individual, firm, partnership or corporation. As
used herein, "open burning" means the burning of any matter in such manner that the products of
combustion from the burning are emitted directly into the ambient air without passing through an
adequate stack or flue. Open burning thus includes burning done in simple outdoor structures such as
barrels and drums as well as on the ground surface.
§ 93-3. Open Burning Official; permit procedures.
The Mayor shall appoint one or more Open Burning Officials of the Town of Wallingford who shall
be solely responsible for the issuance of permits for those open fires excluded from the prohibition
of § 93-2 of this chapter that require a permit.
A permit application for any excluded open fire shall be made on forms furnished by the Open
Burning Official. Each application shall describe the purposes of the fire, the nature and quantity of
the materials to be burned and such other information as the Open Burning Official may require.
A permit issued under this section shall be applicable only for the occasion or the purpose for
which it was obtained.

The fire constitutes a salvage operation by open burning;
A practical and alternative method for the disposal of the material to be burned exists, including

preparation of this plan as it pertains to town organization, it is the intent that the services,
equipment, facilities and personnel of all existing departments and agencies shall be utilized to the
fullest extent. When approved, it shall be the duty of all municipal departments and agencies to
perform the functions assigned by the plan and to maintain their portion of the plan in a current
state of readiness at all times. The operations plan shall be considered supplementary to this
chapter and have the effect of law whenever a disaster, as defined in this chapter, has been
proclaimed.
The Mayor shall prescribe in the operations plan those positions within the disaster organization,
in addition to his own, for which lines of succession are necessary. In each instance, the
responsible person will designate and keep on file with the Mayor and the Director a current list of
three persons as successors to his position. The list will be in order of succession and will as
nearly as possible designate persons best capable of carrying out all assigned duties and
functions.
Each service chief and department head assigned responsibility in the operations plan shall be
responsible for carrying out all duties and functions assigned therein. Duties will include the
organization and training of assigned town employees and volunteers. Each chief shall formulate
the operational plan for his service which, when approved, shall be an annex to and a part of the
operations plan. All other town employees not specifically assigned a disaster task shall make
themselves available upon request of the Mayor for emergency assignments and duties.
Amendments to the operations plan shall be submitted to the Mayor by the Director. If approved,
the Mayor will submit the amendments to the Town Council with his recommendations for their
approval. Such amendments shall take effect immediately unless action is taken by the Town
Council disapproving the Mayor's submission. In the event that an amendment is pending at the
time that a disaster is proclaimed under the provisions of this chapter, the amendment will be
considered approved immediately and will remain effective unless specifically revoked by the
Town Council.
When required competency or skill for a disaster function is not available within the town
government, the Mayor is authorized to seek assistance from persons outside of government. The
assignment of duties, when of a supervisory nature, shall also grant authority for the persons so
assigned to carry out such duties prior to, during and after the occurrence of a disaster. Such
services from persons outside of government may be accepted by the town on a volunteer basis.
Such citizens shall be enrolled as civil preparedness volunteers in cooperation with the heads of
town departments affected.
Some of the duties ascribed to the Mayor in this section will ordinarily be handled as a matter of
routine by the Director, but the responsibility and authority stem from and remain with the Mayor.
§ 98-6. Liability.
This chapter is an exercise by the town of its governmental functions for the protection of the
public peace, health, safety and welfare, and neither the town nor agents and representatives of
said town nor any individual, receiver, firm, partnership, corporation, association or trustee or any
of the agents thereof in good faith carrying out, complying with or attempting to comply with any
order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable for
any damage sustained to persons or property as a result of said activity.
Any person owning or controlling real estate or other premises who voluntarily and without
compensation grants the town the right to inspect, designate and use the whole or any part or
parts of such real estate or premises for the purpose of sheltering persons during an actual,
impending or practice enemy attack or any type of emergency situation shall not be civilly liable for
the death of or injury to any persons on or about such real estate or premises under such license,
privilege or other permission or for loss of or damage to the property of such person.

Pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, and the Charter of the

§ 115-3. Establishment of zones.
Whenever the Fire Marshal shall determine that the reasonable safety of persons occupying or using
any premises, public or private, other than a private residential dwelling consisting of four or less
separate apartment units, requires the establishment of a fire zone for the orderly access to said
premises of fire and other emergency equipment, he shall recommend to the Director of Public Safety
that said Director establish such fire zone. Prior to making such recommendation, said Fire Marshal or
Deputy Fire Marshal shall discuss the area of the proposed fire zone with the owner or owners or
agents of said premises. No fire zone shall be recommended or established by said Director of Public
Safety for any building which immediately abuts a public highway unless the owner of said building
consents, in writing, to the establishment of said zone. For the purposes of this chapter, a building will
be considered to immediately abut a public highway if it is no more than 15 feet from the town street
line.

one copy of the order with the Town Clerk and one copy with the Traffic Division of the Police

Any person aggrieved by said order may appeal therefrom to the Court of Common Pleas for the
County of New Haven within 30 days from the date of delivery of such notice.
§ 115-6. Erection of signs.
Within 30 days of the establishment of a fire zone, the Traffic Division of the Police Department shall
cause to be erected or installed adequate signs and/or markings or other devices to delineate said fire
zone. Such signs and/or markings or other devices installed on privately owned premises, as ordered
by the Director of Public Safety, shall be at the cost of the owner. All such signs or markings shall read,
FIRE ZONE NO PARKING — VIOLATORS WILL BE TOWED. Should the owner or owners or agents
thereof of any private land fail to comply with the order of the Director of Public Safety, the Fire Marshal
or the Deputy Fire Marshal may have the Traffic Division erect said signs and establish said markings,
and the cost of said signs and the installation thereof shall be billed to the owner or owners or agents
thereof and collected in the same manner as municipal taxes, provided that the Traffic Division causes
a notice of lien to be filed on the land records within 60 days after the erection or installation of said
signs or markings.
§ 115-7. Violations and penalties.
No person shall park or permit to stand a motor vehicle in a fire zone which has been established in

vehicle.

[Amended 2-28-1989 by Ord. No. 371]
Whenever a vehicle is found standing in violation of § 115-7, a police officer shall serve upon the
owner or operator of such vehicle, or place upon such vehicle, a notice directing the owner or operator
thereof to appear at the Police Department prior to a time specified in said notice. If any person

establishments conform to the CT DPH regulations. To determine the extent of
compliance with such provisions, the Director of Health may accept reports from responsible
authorities in other jurisdictions where such food-service establishments are located.
Whenever the Director of Health and/or authorized agent finds unsanitary or other conditions
in the operation of a food-service establishment which, in his judgment, constitute a
substantial hazard to the public health, he shall issue a written notice to the permit holder or
operator citing such condition, specifying the corrective action to be taken and specifying the
time period within which such action shall be taken; and, if deemed necessary, shall
immediately suspend the permit and that all food-service operations are to cease

provided by the Director of Health. Prior to such action, the Director of Health shall issue a legal
notice of revocation to notify the permit holder, stating the reasons for which the permit is subject
to revocation and advising that the permit shall be permanently revoked at the end of three days
following service of such notice, unless a written request for a hearing is filed with the Director of
Health, by the permit holder, within such three-day period. A permit may be suspended for cause
pending its revocation or a hearing relative thereto.
Hearings. The permit holder may request a hearing conducted by the Director of Health within
three days of the notice of revocation or suspension and will be given the opportunity to be heard
and to show cause why the permit to operate the food establishment should not be suspended or
revoked. Based upon findings of such hearing the Director of Health shall sustain, modify, or
rescind any official notice or legal order considered in the hearing. A written report of the hearing
decision shall be furnished to the permit holder by the Director of Health. Any permit holder who is
issued a legal order to comply may appeal as per the appeal process afforded in the Connecticut
General Statutes.

investigation as may be indicated and take appropriate action. The Director of Health may require
any or all of the following measures:
The immediate exclusion or restriction of the employee(s) from all food-service activities.
The immediate closure of the food-service establishment concerned until, in the opinion of the
Director of Health, no further danger of disease outbreak exists.

The Town Council finds that the uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in public
rights-of-way presents an inconvenience and/or danger to persons using such rights-of-way; that
garish, brightly colored or otherwise unsightly newsracks located within public rights-of-way constitute
distractions to the driving public; that newsracks are constantly exposed to the elements, are subject to
intensive use and vandalism and to protect against such must be designed and constructed of durable
materials; and that the use of public rights-of-way has been historically associated with the sale and
distribution of newspapers. The Town Council further finds that in order to accommodate the
governmental and distribution interests it is necessary to implement a program to regulate the
installation, operation and maintenance of newsracks located in public rights-of-way in the Town of
Wallingford.

Any person may contest the citation for violation(s) of this article as per Connecticut General Statutes
§ 7-152c, as amended, and as provided herein.
The Mayor shall appoint one or more Citation Hearing Officers other than an employee from any
of the departments with responsibility as a Code Enforcement Official, who shall serve until a
successor is appointed.
The person aggrieved may contest his liability by delivering in person or by mail a completed
citation appeals form to the Town Clerk's office, Town Hall, Room 108, 45 South Main Street,
Wallingford, CT. Citation appeals must be received within 10 calendars days of the date of the
issuance of the citation.
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure set forth in Connecticut General
Statutes § 7-152c, as amended:
Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place
for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from

shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An
original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the issuing official or

business record within the scope of § 52-180 and evidence of the facts contained therein. The

requests. A person wishing to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing and may present
evidence in his behalf. A designated municipal official, other than the hearing officer, may
present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If such person fails to appear, the hearing
officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of proper notice and
liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The hearing officer may accept from such
person copies of police reports, investigatory and citation reports, and other official
documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is
unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with
such methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility
of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or
affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing (which
may be continued for reasonable cause or in order to inspect the property). If he determines
that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing
accordingly. If he determines that the person is liable for the violation, he shall forthwith enter
and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person as provided by the
applicable ordinances of the municipality.
The failure to pay the citation may result in the entry of a judgment by the Superior Court in
accordance with Connecticut General Statutes § 7-152c(f), as amended.
Nothing herein shall prevent any Town official from pursuing any other remedies, including
injunctive relief or a referral to the State's Attorney's office for enforcement.
§ 156-8. Recording of lien.
Any unpaid civil penalty imposed shall constitute a lien upon the real estate in accordance with
Connecticut General Statutes § 7-148aa. Each such lien shall be continued, recorded and released as
provided for in Connecticut General Statutes § 7-148aa.
§ 156-9. Housing blight infraction.

Dwelling and dwelling units which are let shall be inspected when the occupant of the unit

on a complaint basis or when, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, it is necessary.
The Code Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized and directed to make inspections, as
authorized by this chapter, by and with the consent of the owner, occupant or person in charge, to
determine the condition of the dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units and premises within this
town for the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of this chapter. For the
purpose of making such inspections, the Code Enforcement Officer, with consent of the owner,
occupant or person in charge, is hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey, between the
hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units and premises, or at
such other time mutually satisfactory to and agreed upon by the Code Enforcement Officer and
the owner or occupant of a dwelling, dwelling or rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof.
Such inspection, examination or survey shall not have for its purpose the undue harassment of
said owner or occupant, and such inspection, examination or survey shall be made so as to cause
the least amount of inconvenience to said owner or occupant, consistent with an efficient
performance of the duties of the Code Enforcement Officer. To further ensure that the policy of this

Code Enforcement Officer shall make every effort to inspect a dwelling or dwelling unit no more
than seven working days after the receipt of a complaint.
The owner or occupant of each dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises, or the person in

give the Code Enforcement Officer entry to the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises,
and free access to every part thereof, provided that no inspection shall be conducted except
during the hours designated above, or at such time as is mutually satisfactory to and agreed upon
by the Code Enforcement Officer and the owner, agent or occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit or
rooming unit.
Whenever an owner, occupant or person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or
premises shall deny the Code Enforcement Officer right of entry for the purpose of inspection,
examination or survey, the Code Enforcement Officer shall not so enter until he presents a
duly issued court order describing the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises to the
owner, occupant or person in charge thereof.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the entry of the Code Enforcement
Officer at any time when, in his judgment, an emergency tending to create an immediate
danger to the public health, welfare or safety exits, or when such entry is requested by the
owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises
or when the Code Enforcement Officer presents a duly issued search warrant to said owner,
occupant or person in charge thereof.
Any owner, occupant or person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or
premises refusing to permit or impeding entry of and free access to any part of any dwelling,
dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises for the purposes of inspection, examination or survey
under the provisions of this subsection and Subsection A above shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor.

§ 177-1. Findings.
In 1975, an ordinance was adopted requiring the disconnection of all drains from roof leaders, cellar
drains, yard drains and sump pumps connected to the sanitary sewer system. Many illegal drains were
disconnected in compliance with the ordinance. In 2009, the Town completed a study indicating that
approximately 83% of the inflow/infiltration arriving at the wastewater treatment plant is from private
sources. Excessive inflow and infiltration is causing decreased sewer capacity and increased treatment
costs. Illegal inflow and infiltration connections must be eliminated.
§ 177-2. Prohibition.
No person, legal entity or other sewer users shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
sanitary sewer collection system any groundwater or stormwater (infiltration and inflow) from any
source. Such sources include, but are not limited to, roof leaders, cellar drains, yard drains,
foundation drains, sump pumps and defective laterals.
The construction, use, maintenance or continued use of such connections to the sanitary sewer
system is prohibited.
§ 177-3. Inspection of property.
The Water and Sewer Division staff and/or their authorized agents will conduct an inspection
program to determine compliance with this article. The Water and Sewer Division staff and/or their
authorized agents shall bear proper credentials and identification, and shall inspect properties at
reasonable times. The inspection shall be limited to such parts of the premises as necessary for
the purpose of inspection and/or testing in accordance with this article.
In addition to the inspections set forth in Subsection A, the Division staff and/or their authorized
agents may conduct an inspection at the following:
When a building permit is issued for improvements/repairs of buildings, costing at least
$25,000.
When an existing sanitary sewer lateral is to be used to serve a new structure on the property.
At the time of an ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, the Division may
inspect the property for compliance with this article.
Upon specific information that the premises may be in violation of this article.
An inspection and/or testing, under this section, may include, but not be limited to, a video
inspection, smoke testing, dye testing and/or visual inspection.
§ 177-4. Order to correct.
After inspection, the property owner shall be notified regarding any defects/illegal connections
found on the property.
If, upon inspection, it is determined that there is an illegal connection/deficiency, the property
owner shall be ordered to permanently disconnect the illegal connection from the system and/or
cure the deficiency at their own expense. The Public Utilities Commission shall enact regulations
providing the procedural requirements for the order to correct, including but not limited to
notification requirements, time requirements and postcorrection inspections.

§ 177-5. Remedies.
Nothing herein shall limit the Public Utilities Commission from employing all available remedies to
address the correction of illegal connections/deficiencies, including but not limited to adopting
appropriate regulations and surcharges. Remedies shall also include legal action to obtain compliance
with the order and any other remedy permitted by law.
§ 177-5.1. Appeal.
Any property owner may appeal an order to correct to the Public Utilities Commission within 30 days
from receipt of the order. The Public Utilities Commission shall hear the appeal and may affirm, modify
or set aside the order or any portion thereof. The Public Utilities Commission may adopt procedural
rules for any appeal as part of its regulations.
§ 177-5.2. Reimbursement program.
[Added 9-10-2015 by Ord. No. 606]
The Public Utilities Commission is authorized to adopt a reimbursement program providing for financial
assistance for funding the removal of the illegal connections upon terms and conditions it deems

specified in § 198-8 and sealed with a temporary asphalt patch. At the end of the 30 days, the
patch shall be removed and the trench reopened and backfill brought to a level to allow for
replacing the concrete base to the thickness of the original concrete, but in no case less than eight
inches in thickness. The concrete shall be of a one-to-two-to-four mix and shall exceed the width
of the trench by at least 12 inches on each side, with the extra width laid on virgin soil. Concrete
placed in any pavement shall be allowed to cure for not less than 72 hours.
All excavations shall be properly protected by barricades and warning lights furnished and
maintained by the contractor during the curing period. If the concrete is a base material, the top
surface shall be of bituminous concrete or other paving material approved by the Engineer, with a
minimum compacted thickness of three inches, properly joined and sealed to the existing
pavement. The sides of all excavations and patches in pavements shall be cut in a straight line
where joined to the old pavement. If the concrete is the finish paving material, the concrete shall
be screeded and rubbed to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

removed from the site. All lawned areas are to be fine graded with topsoil equivalent to adjacent
soil and seeded as approved by the Engineer.
All other highway structures, signs, pavement marking, sewers or subsurface structures shall be
restored to their original condition before the excavation was made.
§ 198-9.1. Protection of excavations.
All excavations shall be protected at all times by barricades, danger warning signs, and during the
night by flares or red warning lights. Only 1/2 of the traveled portion of the street or highway shall be
excavated or remain open, permitting safe passage of vehicular traffic on the remaining half. Under no
circumstances shall an excavation or opening be made in the width of the entire street or highway, or
in such a manner as to prohibited the safe passage of vehicular traffic without the written permission of
the Engineer and the Chief of Police or Deputy Chief of Police. Such written permission shall be
obtained in advance of such excavation or opening. The Engineer and the Chief of Police or Deputy
Chief of Police may prescribe such conditions as they shall deem necessary to render such
excavations safe.
§ 198-9.2. Maintenance.
The permittee shall guarantee to maintain the repaired patch during the life of the temporary patch and
for a period of 120 days after certification of acceptance of the permanent patch by the Engineer. In the
event that it is necessary to make repairs to the excavation or restoration of the pavement or patch
during said one-hundred-twenty-day period, said guarantee shall be extended for an additional period
of 60 days. The performance bond shall include said conditions of maintenance within its provisions.

Article VI. Abatement for Members of Volunteer Fire
Departments
[Adopted 10-28-2003 by Ord. No. 512[1]]
Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Art. VI, Abatement for Members of Volunteer Fire
Departments, adopted 10-28-2003 by Ord. No. 512.
§ 203-13. Purpose.
The Town Council hereby reaffirms and restates its purpose when the original version of this article
was adopted on November 14, 2000, to wit: as an incentive to encourage those serving as volunteer
fire fighters, emergency medical technicians, paramedics or ambulance drivers to continue their
volunteer service and to encourage others to join one of Wallingford's volunteer fire departments. The
Town Council, however, because of a ruling by the United States Internal Revenue Service that
because the volunteers are providing a service to the Town of Wallingford they are deemed to be
employees and subject, therefore, to all payroll taxes, is required to amend the ordinance to mandate
that the amount of the tax abatement available to individual volunteers be paid in dollars and that such
payment be made subject to state and federal income taxes and FICA and Medicare taxes.
§ 203-14. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ABATEMENT
The payment in dollars which is the equivalent of the reduction in property taxes owed by the
volunteer under the provisions of this article; subject, however, to state and federal income taxes
and Medicare and FICA taxes.

until the volunteer has also qualified for LOSAP credit for the next preceding calendar year, except that

§ 206-1. Findings of fact and purpose.
Tobacco use is one of the foremost preventable causes of premature death in America.
Approximately 95% of adult smokers began smoking before they turned 21. The ages of 18 to 21
are a critical period when many smokers move from experimental smoking to regular, daily use.
Young people are particularly susceptible to the addictive properties of tobacco products. Tobacco
industry documents show that individuals who start smoking by the age of 18 are almost twice as
likely to become lifetime smokers as those who start after they turn 21.
Most people who are not smokers by 21 years of age do not start smoking later in their lives.
Electronic smoking device use among minors has recently tripled.
Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is highly addictive and may harm the development of
the adolescent brain into the early- to mid-twenties.

Increases in adolescent vaping from 2017 to 2018 were the largest adolescent substance use
recorded in 43 years.
The e-cigarette aerosol that users breathe from the device and exhale can contain harmful and
potentially harmful substances, including:
Nicotine.
Ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
Flavoring such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease.
Volatile organic compounds.
Cancer-causing chemicals.
Heavy metals such as lead, chromium, cadmium.
Ethanol.
The Institute of Medicine predicted in a 2015 report that raising the minimum legal sales age for
tobacco products to 21 nationwide will have a substantial positive impact on public health and
provide long-term declines in smoking rates by reducing tobacco initiation among adolescents
aged 15 to 17 by 25% and overall prevalence of tobacco use by 12%. This report also projects
that 4.2 million young people alive today would be protected from premature death related to
tobacco use as a result of raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products to 21.

§ 216-6. Notice on illegally parked vehicles; time period for

Whenever any vehicle is found parked in violation of this chapter or of any traffic rule or regulation
which relates to parking, any police officer finding such vehicle shall take its registration number,
and may take any other information displayed on the vehicle which may identify its user, and shall
conspicuously affix to such vehicle notice, in writing, on a form provided by the Chief of Police, to
the owner or operator thereof, stating that such vehicle has been parked unlawfully, and shall state

and/or regulation of the town traffic authority has been violated and shall moreover contain the
following declaration:
"WARNING
The accumulation of three or more unsatisfied
municipal vehicle parking citations upon any one
vehicle may result in the impoundment or
immobilization of said vehicle upon the occasion
of any subsequent violation of any municipal
traffic ordinance, rule or regulation."
Each such owner or operator may, within 15 days of the time of such notice being attached to
such vehicle, pay in person or remit by mail in the form of a check or money order payable to the
Town of Wallingford and delivered or mailed to the Wallingford Police Department as specified on

fees, the sum specified on such notice, in accordance with the penalties set forth in this chapter.
Payment in person shall be made during normal business hours at the Records Department of the
Wallingford Police Department.
The failure of such owner or operator to make payment to the Town of Wallingford at the Police
Department or to timely appeal the violation within 15 days of the time when such notice is
attached to the vehicle shall render him liable to a penalty equal to twice the amount of the initial
penalty provided. The failure of such owner or operator to make such payment to the Town of
Wallingford at the Police Department within 30 days of the time when such notice is attached to
the vehicle shall render the owner or operator liable to a penalty equal to three times the amount
of the initial penalty provided.

Whenever any vehicle is found parked in violation of any municipal traffic ordinance, rule or
regulation, and where there are three or more previously issued municipal parking citations
outstanding upon said vehicle, then a member of the Police Department may place or direct a
person or persons so authorized by the Chief of Police to place an immobilization device upon

this section, then said device may not be removed or otherwise tampered with by anyone who has
not been authorized to do so by the Chief of Police. The penalty for unlawfully removing or
otherwise tampering with said device shall be $100.
The owner of any vehicle impounded or immobilized under this section shall have the right to
contest such impoundment or immobilization by application on a form prescribed by the traffic
authority.
The owner of any vehicle impounded or otherwise rendered immobile by application of a
mechanical device shall be duly informed as to which provisions of this chapter, the city
ordinances and/or rules and regulations of the traffic authority have necessitated the impoundment
and/or the immobilization of said vehicle.
Before the owner of any impounded or immobilized vehicle shall be permitted to remove the
impounded vehicle from such impound, such person shall provide evidence of his identity and
ownership, shall sign a receipt for such vehicle and shall pay the cost of towing and storage for
each day or portion of a day that such vehicle is stored by the tower in excess of the first 24 hours.
The Chief of Police shall not authorize and/or direct the removal of an immobilization device from
any vehicle or the release of any vehicle placed within a pound pursuant to this section until such
time as the owner or person in charge of said vehicle shall have supplied the Chief of Police with
evidence of his identify and ownership; and satisfied all outstanding municipal parking citations
against the subject vehicle to the satisfaction of the Chief of Police.
It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police, or such other police officer as he shall designate, to keep
a record of the names of the owners of all vehicles impounded and/or immobilized, the numbers of
their state license plates, the place where each vehicle was impounded or immobilized, the nature
and circumstances of each violation and the disposition of each case.
§ 216-8. Hearing.
Any person whose vehicle is immobilized or impounded because of the existence of four or more
outstanding citations may request an immediate hearing on the validity of the charges on which the
immobilization or impoundment was based. A hearing shall be convened thereafter by one of the
parking violation hearing officers as soon as practicable. The procedure for the hearing shall be
informal as to the rules of evidence, but testimony shall be taken under oath or affirmation. In
considering the charges, the hearing officer may consider all relevant facts and circumstances and
may require the personal appearance of the person requesting the hearing and the issuing officer.
Should the hearing officer find in favor of the person charged, he shall so certify to the town, and the
record of charge or charges shall be removed from the files of the town and the vehicle released to the
owner. Should the hearing officer find the issuance of the charge or charges proper, he shall so certify
to the town, and no further appeal for a hearing shall be considered. The hearing officer shall
determine the amount due the town for the cost of immobilization or impoundment and the amount due
for citations outstanding. The owner may regain possession by paying the amount found due by the
hearing officer and establishing his identity and right to possession and upon signing a proper receipt
for the vehicle. If not paid on the same day, the owner shall also pay all charges due for storage of the
vehicle.

Special Permit, Special Exception - A use of property that is basically
appropriate to a given zoning district, but which may be incompatible in some
locations within the district and, therefore, is not permitted by right everywhere
within such district. Such use is allowable only when facts and conditions
specified in the regulations as those upon which the use is permitted are found to
exist.
Start of Construction – Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual “start of” means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring
of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets

or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial

alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 06/18/00
State - State of Connecticut
Story - That part of any building exclusive of cellars, but inclusive of

the top of the roof beams.

Substantial Damage – Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
06/18/00
Substantial Improvement – Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration,
or improvements to a structure taking place over a ten-year period, in which the
cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the
structure. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of
the structure “using the cost approach to value" prior to the start of initial
repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure
prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, “Substantial
Improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does

in the text of these regulations by its symbol only.
§3.2 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
A. The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on the
4/l4/86 Official Zoning Map of the Town of Wallingford, adopted October 30,
1958, effective November 7, 1958, revised January 1986 and which map and any
amendments thereof are hereby declared to be part of these regulations.
39
§3.3 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
A. Along right-of-way. Where a district boundary is shown following a street,
river, a public right-of-way or a railroad, the boundary is respectively the
center line of such street, river or public right-of- way or a line located
midway between the main tracts of said railroad and such boundary shall be
deemed to be changed automatically whenever the center line of such street or
public right-of-way is changed or said main railroad tracks are changed, if
the new center line is no farther from the old center line than fifty feet at
any point.
B. Map dimensions. Where a dimension is indicated on the Official Zoning Map,
such dimension shall control. However, in the absence of a specific dimension
being indicated on the map, the dimension shall be determined by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer (ZEO) using the map scale.
C. Physical markers. Where a street, highway, railroad or other physical
monument or marker on the ground by which a boundary is determined varies from
that as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the on-the-ground monument or marker
shall control.
D. Lot boundaries. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following lot lines of record at the time of adoption of these regulations,
these lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
E. Lots lying within more than one district. In all cases where on the effective
date of these regulations a district boundary divided a lot, other than a
through lot, in one ownership, in a way that 50 percent or more of such lot
lies in the less restricted district, the regulations prescribed herein for
such less restricted district shall apply to such portion of the more
restricted portion of said lot which lies within 30 feet of such district
boundary provided that such lot has frontage on a street in the less
restrictive district. For purpose of this section, the more restricted
district shall be deemed that district which is subject to regulations which
prohibit the particular use intended to be made of said lot or which
regulations set higher standards with respect to set-back, coverage, yards,
screening, landscaping and similar requirements.

§4.l2. AQUIFER PROTECTION (APD) DISTRICT Deleted 02/19/06
§4.13 WATERSHED PROTECTION (WPD) DISTRICT Revised 10/16/10
A. Purpose - An overlay district which provides for additional
conditions, standards and safeguards to the permitted uses of the
underlying district in order to protect and maintain the surface
waters of the Wallingford, Meriden and SCRWA Public Water Supply Watersheds to
a quality consistent with their use as the primary source of drinking water
for Wallingford and area towns.
B. Stormwater Runoff Treatment - The stormwater runoff generated by the
initial 0.5" to 1.0" of rainfall from all parking lots and from travel ways
where topographically feasible, within the confines of any approved commercial
or industrial development, located upon the three Public Water Supply
Watersheds, shall be collected and treated.
1. Treatment shall be required to the extent that the quality of the
stormwater runoff from the site shall comply with the Connecticut Water
Quality Standards & Criteria for class AA drinking water supply surface
waters as promulgated by the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, Water Compliance Unit or with §19-13-B102 of the State Public
Health Code, or the latest revision thereof, as it applies to the standards
for quality of untreated water at the intake to a treatment plant with
"complete conventional treatment", whichever is more stringent except that
the standard for total coliform in §19-13-B102 of the Public Health Code
shall apply.
2. The amount of stormwater runoff to be collected and treated (within the
range of the initial 0.5" to 1.0" of rainfall occurring within any specific
48 hour period which is initiated by the start of a rainfall event) shall
be determined for each site on an individual basis by the Wallingford Water
Division in accordance with site usage, acreage, topography and other
considerations.
3. The treatment system shall be incorporated within a stormwater management
system for the total site which will provide a mechanism to divert and
capture for treatment "initial" runoff from appropriate areas as defined
above and which will provide for the remainder of the stormwater runoff to
be diverted into a conventional detention basin for peak flow attenuation.
4. Treatment shall consist of a system which incorporates recognized
technologies which have been demonstrated to provide the necessary pollutant
removal capabilities. In all cases, minimum treatment shall consist of a
"grease trap" type separator designed to remove and retain oils, scums, and
other floatables from the diverted "initial" runoff, to be followed by
storage in an infiltration basin. This infiltration basin shall be designed
to promote infiltration of the effluent into the ground. Water in this
infiltration basin shall be aerated. All proposed treatment systems shall be
subject to approval by the Wallingford Water Division. Since operation of
the treatment system will be intermittent, equipment and structures shall be
housed so that the system can operate in all seasons of the year.
5. The owner shall submit complete calculations, design drawings and an
operations/maintenance plan for the stormwater management and treatment
systems to the Wallingford Water Division for approval. The owner shall
also develop and submit for approval by the Water Division, a street
sweeping plan for the completed site which shall set forth a schedule for
the periodic sweeping of parking lots and travel ways. The owner shall also
develop and submit for approval by Water Division, a schedule for the
periodic cleaning of the required separator. l0/02/94
6. The Water Division shall, on a regular basis, sample the effluent of the
stormwater management system prior to its leaving the site. The samples
shall be analyzed by a State certified laboratory for parameters to be
86
determined by the Water Division in order to confirm compliance of the site
runoff with the previously cited water quality standards. The Water
Division shall bill the owner of the site for the cost of the analysis of
up to four samples per year.
7. The Water Division shall have the right of access without notice for the
purpose of insuring that the owner properly maintains and operates the
facility. The Water Division shall have the right to take water samples,
order repairs or changes to the equipment and facility when warranted.
8. The owner shall post a performance bond with the Water Division to cover the
construction and start-up of the storm water treatment system, in an amount
and in a form to be determined by the Water Division. This work may also be
incorporated within the normal water/sewer utility installation performance
bond required for the site. 03/l9/95
C. Installation of Storage Containers:
l. All storage vessels located within the Wallingford, Meriden & SCRWA Public
Water Supply Watersheds and located above or below ground level, or in a

rupture. An alternative to the non-porous vault may be a dual-walled vessel
with a UL approval. The dual-wall vessel shall be constructed with a
secondary wall completely surrounding the primary wall, and there shall be a
definite annular space between them.
4. A monitoring system shall be incorporated for all buried installations to
detect leaks. The leak monitoring system may be a simple flexible dipstick
capable of protruding into the space between tank and vault or the annular
space to be provided with the dual-wall system. More elaborate electronic
systems will be acceptable.
5. For all installations not meeting one of the exemptions listed below, a
written inventory record itemizing the balance of incoming material vs.
outgoing material shall be kept on a daily basis. A record of the
monitoring results shall also be kept on a daily basis. These records
shall be available on demand without notice, to officials of the Town Water
Division or Fire Prevention Bureau. Facilities shall be exempt from the
daily reporting requirements if they:
a. Generate small quantities of hazardous waste as defined by §5 of the
Hazardous Waste Management Guidelines for Small Quantity Generators

and the relationship of each building in the development to
other buildings in the development. The Commission considers
HOD developments to be entirely different types of neighborhoods
than those developed under traditional
subdivision and zoning standards. In an HOD, no individual
lots are created; all land is owned in common. As such, the
following policies shall apply:
101
a. Accessory apartments are not permitted.
b. Additions, including rooms, sun porches, and garages, to
individual units, are not permitted.
c. Accessory buildings and swimming polls for the exclusive
use of individual units are not permitted.

maintained by the homeowners’ association and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission, is permitted.
F. The following requirements shall apply to a HOD:
1. HOD Homes shall be of a construction quality that is comparable
to market rate homes within the development. The final site
plan and plan for administration of affordability rules shall
identify the locations within the HOD Development of the HOD
Homes.
2. The HOD Homes shall be built on a pro rata basis as
construction proceeds.
3. In a HOD Development, no HOD Home shall have less than 3 nor

utilize the area median income data as published by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in effect
on the day a purchase and sales agreement is executed by
the parties.
5. The maximum monthly payment that the owner of a HOD Home
shall pay shall not be greater than the amount that will
preserve such unit as “affordable housing” as that term is
defined in Connecticut General Statutes §8-30g, and shall
include periodic mortgage payments, based on a commercially
reasonable down payment for affordable housing buyers and
prevailing interest rates at the time of sale; taxes;
insurance; common charges in the case of ownership of a
unit in a common interest community; heat; and utility
costs, including hot water and electricity, but excluding
telephone and cable television.
However, common interest ownership fees charged to owners
of HOD Homes shall not be set by the association so as to
cause such owners to pay more than the maximum monthly
payment allowed by law. It is recognized that monthly
requirements for the other items may reduce what a HOD Home
owner may pay to a minimal amount. This limitation on such
fees shall be incorporated into common interest ownership
documents for the development.
6. HOD Homes shall be occupied only as an owner’s principal
residence. Renting or leasing of HOD Homes shall be
prohibited.
7. At the same time that the market-rate homes in a HOD
Development are first advertised to the general public,
notice of availability of the HOD Homes shall be provided
by advertising such availability in the real estate section
of a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of
Wallingford, by providing notice to the Wallingford Town
Council, the Wallingford Town Clerk, and the Wallingford
Planning and Zoning Commission, and through the procedures
outlined in the affirmative fair housing marketing plan.
8. For one of every 3 HOD Homes which becomes available for initial
sale, preference shall be given to applicants who are otherwise
102
qualified and are residents or employees of the Town of
Wallingford, a child or parent of Wallingford residents or those
who meet the criteria of “least likely to apply” as defined in
Connecticut Agencies Regulations §8-37ee.
9. Each deed for an HOD Home will contain substantially the
following provision:
This unit is sold as an “affordable home as
defined in Connecticut General Statute §8-30g,
and is available only to persons or families
whose income is at or below eighty percent (80%)
or sixty (60%), as applicable, of the area median
income for Wallingford or the statewide median
income, whichever is less, as determined by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This development has been approved by agencies of
the Town of Wallingford based in part on the conditions
that a defined percentage of homes will be preserved as
affordable housing homes. The restrictions related to
affordability are required by law to be strictly enforced.
10. The 50 year affordability period shall be calculated separately
for each HOD Home in a HOD Development, and the period shall
begin on the date, as defined at closing, of occupancy of the
Home.
11. In conjunction with an application for approval of a final
site plan for a HOD Development, the applicant shall submit
an “Affordability Plan,” which shall describe how the
regulations regarding affordability will be administered.
The Plan shall include provisions for administration of and
compliance with the provision of this section, notice
procedures to the general public of the availability of
affordable homes, identification of those homes which are to be
designated affordable, procedures for verification and periodic
confirmation of unit occupancy income, and compliance with
affordability requirements. Such Plan shall also include
drafts of documents that will be used in the administration of
the affordability restrictions and any explanations which will
be provided to the prospective owners concerning such
restrictions.
12. The applicant shall also submit an affirmative fair housing
marketing plan to govern the sales of all HOD Homes at the time
of final site plan approval.
13. A violation of the Regulations contained in this section shall
not result in a forfeiture or reversion of title, by the
Wallingford Planning and Zoning Commission or its designated
agent shall otherwise retain all enforcement powers granted by
the Connecticut General Statutes, including the authority under
§8-12 to issue notices of violations, to impose fines, and to
seek injunctive relief. 10/18/01

minimum planted buffer shall be 50% of the required building
setback. Additional buffering may be required by the Commission to
meet the purposes of this section to protect existing residential
uses or to protect residents of the WHOD from existing commercial
uses.
8. Parking – Parking shall be provided in conformity with the requirements
of §6.11. Parking shall not be permitted in any required property
boundary setback area. All homes in an HOD development will have a

in length, which are not required to be curbed, may have a minimum
paved width of 22 feet. All roads shall be constructed in accordance
with standards specified in the Town’s Subdivision Regulations except
that curbs may be waived at the discretion of the Commission.
Individual driveways onto existing Town roads shall be prohibited.
14. Fire Hydrants – Fire hydrants shall be installed and located within 500
feet of each dwelling unit.
15. Adherence to Conceptual Site Plan – The development of a parcel that
has been re-zoned to WHOD based on submission of a conceptual plan and

streets.
17. Landscaping – In addition to a landscaped buffer, foundation
plantings and landscaped parking areas per §6.14.E shall be required.
18. A school bus shelter shall be required at the main entrance.
19. Additions and modifications after approval: 11/13/04
The Commission approves each WHOD as a planned development and is
concerned over both the architectural design of each unit and the
relationship of each building in the development to other buildings
in the development. The Commission considers WHOD developments to be
entirely different types of neighborhoods than those developed under
traditional subdivision and zoning standards. In a WHOD, no
individual lots are created; all land is owned in common. As such,
the following policies shall apply:
a. Accessory apartments are not permitted.
b. Additions, including rooms, sun porches and garages, to
individual units, are not permitted.
c. Accessory buildings and swimming pools for the exclusive use of
individual units are not permitted.
d. Enlarged decks are not permitted.
e. Only decorative fencing shown on the site plan, owned and
maintained by the homeowners’ association and approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, is permitted.
G. The following requirements shall apply to a WHOD:
1. WHOD Homes shall be of a construction quality that is comparable to
market rate homes within the development. The final site plan and
plan for administration of affordability rules shall identify the
locations within the WHOD Development of the WHOD Homes.
2. The WHOD Homes shall be built on a pro rata basis as construction
proceeds.
3. In a WHOD Development, no WHOD Home shall have less than 1 nor more
than 3 bedrooms.
4. Calculation of the maximum monthly payment for a WHOD Home, so as to
satisfy Connecticut General Statute §8-30g, shall utilize the area
median income data as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development in effect on the day a purchase and sales agreement
is executed by the parties.
5. The maximum monthly payment that the owner of a WHOD Home shall pay
shall not be greater than the amount that will preserve such unit as
“affordable housing” as that term is defined in Connecticut General
Statutes §8-30g, and shall include periodic mortgage payments, based
on a commercially reasonable down payment for affordable housing
buyers and prevailing interest rates at he time of sale; taxes;
insurance; common charges in the case of ownership of a unit in a
common interest community; heat; and utility costs, including hot
water and electricity, but excluding telephone and cable television.
However, common interest ownership fees charged to owners of WHOD
Homes shall not be set by the association so as to cause such owners
to pay more than the maximum monthly payment allowed by law. It is
recognized that monthly requirements for the other items may reduce
what a WHOD Home owner may pay to a minimal amount. This limitation
on such fees shall be incorporated into common interest ownership
documents for the development.
106
6. WHOD Homes shall be occupied only as an owner’s principal residence.
Renting or leasing of WHOD Homes shall be prohibited.
7. At the same time that the market-rate homes in a WHOD Development
are first advertised to the general public, notice of
availability of the WHOD Homes shall be provided by advertising such
availability in the real estate section of a newspaper of general
circulation in the Town of Wallingford, by providing notice to the
Wallingford Town Council, the Wallingford Town Clerk, and the
Wallingford Planning and Zoning Commission, and through the procedures
outlined in the affirmative fair housing marketing plan.
8. For one of every 3 WHOD Homes which becomes available for initial
sale, preference shall be given to applicants who are otherwise
qualified and are residents or employees of the Town of Wallingford,
a child or parent of Wallingford residents or those who meet the
criteria of “least likely to apply” as defined in Connecticut
Agencies Regulations §8-37ee.
9. Each deed for a WHOD Home will contain substantially the following
provision:
This unit is sold as an “affordable home as defined in
Connecticut General Statute §8-30g, and is available
only to persons or families whose income is at or below
80% or 60%, as applicable, of the area median income for
Wallingford or the statewide median income, whichever is less,
as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development. This development has been approved by agencies of
the Town of Wallingford based in part on the conditions that a
defined percentage of homes will be preserved as affordable
housing homes. The restrictions related to affordability are
required by law to be strictly enforced.
10. The 60 year affordability period shall be calculated separately for
each WHOD Home in a WHOD Development, and the period shall begin on
the date, as defined at closing, of occupancy of the Home.
11. In conjunction with an application for approval of a final site plan
for a WHOD Development, the applicant shall submit an “Affordability
Plan,” which shall describe how the regulations regarding
affordability will be administered. The Plan shall include
provisions for administration of and compliance with the provision of
this section, notice procedures to the general public of the
availability of affordable homes, identification of those homes which
are to be designated affordable, procedures for verification and
periodic confirmation of unit occupancy income, and compliance with
affordability requirements. Such Plan shall also include drafts of
documents that will be used in the administration of the
affordability restrictions and any explanations which will be
provided to the prospective owners concerning such restrictions.
12. The applicant shall also submit an affirmative fair housing marketing
plan to govern the sales of all WHOD Homes at the time of final site
plan approval.
13. A violation of the Regulations contained in this section shall
not result in a forfeiture or reversion of title, but the
Wallingford Planning and Zoning Commission or its designated
agent shall otherwise retain all enforcement powers granted by
the Connecticut General Statutes, including the authority under
§8-12 to issue notices of violations, to impose fines, and to
seek injunctive relief.

§4.23 – Wallingford Incentive Housing Zone – 08/23/14
A. Purposes. The Wallingford Incentive Housing Zone is an overlay district
whose purposes are:
1. To promote the revitalization of downtown Wallingford by encouraging
mixed-use development that will provide for a variety of housing and
business opportunities.
2. To provide the opportunity for the downtown to transform into a retail
environment that offers a distinctive experience for consumers.
3. To encourage smart growth and low-impact development.
4. To promote the development of a transit-oriented, pedestrian-friendly,
downtown community within walking distance to the Wallingford stop on
the Springfield-New Haven commuter line. It is recommended that the
platform be located toward the northern end of the IHZ to avoid
traffic congestion on Quinnipiac Street and Hall Avenue during train
stops.
5. To assist the Town of Wallingford in complying with the State Zoning
Enabling Act, Connecticut General Statutes § 8-2, by adopting zoning
regulations that promote housing choice and economic diversity,
including housing for moderate income households.
6. To ensure high quality site planning, architecture, and landscape
design that is consistent with the surrounding residential
neighborhoods and the distinct visual character of the historic
structures in downtown Wallingford.
7. To establish development standards that ensure context-sensitive
design and creative site planning in the reuse of existing buildings
and construction of new buildings.
8. To benefit from the financial incentives provided by Connecticut
General Statutes §8-13m et seq.
B. Location. The boundaries of this IHZ Overlay District are shown on the
Wallingford Zoning Map. The IHZ Overlay District is further divided into
three sub-districts as shown on the map: Downtown Core, North Cherry
Street, and Meadow Street.
C. Applicability. The regulations and design standards in this §4.23 shall
apply to any proposed Incentive Housing Development within the IHZ Overlay
District.
1. Because the IHZ Overlay District is an overlay zone, the provisions of
the underlying zoning district shall not apply to a proposed Incentive
Housing Development, and such underlying zoning designation shall
terminate upon approval of a site plan of an Incentive Housing
Development. Reinstatement of the underlying zoning shall require a
zone change approved by the Commission, and shall only be approved if
the Incentive Housing Development is not constructed.
2. The provisions of other sections of the Wallingford Zoning Regulations
shall apply to an Incentive Housing Development proposal except for
the following:
a. All Incentive Housing Developments shall provide required
parking on the same property as Development is located. Required
on-site parking shall be governed by Section F.1 of
this regulation.
b. All landscaping and buffer requirements shall be covered by
Section L of this regulation.
c. All signage shall be governed by Sec. J of this regulation.
d. All dimensional standards shall be governed by Section E of this
regulation.
e. The application process shall be governed by Sec. G of this
regulation.
3. Existing buildings in the IHZ which have been renovated utilizing
Formatted: Indent: Left: 1"
112
federal and/or state tax credits may not be demolished, but may be
expanded.
D. Description of Sub-Districts.
1. Downtown Core Sub-District. This area, the primary focus of the IHZ
Overlay District, includes 40 parcels with 40 existing buildings (not
including sheds and similar structures), on 10.01 acres of developable
land as defined in General Statutes §§ 8-13m(3), now or previously
used for retail, office, industrial or residential. This area has
seen significant disinvestment in recent years and many buildings are
in need of attention or have become obsolete. Many buildings in this
area are single story, creating a spread out land use pattern that is
not conducive to pedestrian traffic. By encouraging the use of
vertical space in this compact area, the vitality and livability of
the downtown will be enhanced, drawing more customers for businesses
and increasing the tax base. To that end, the following principles
shall be utilized for developing and reviewing Incentive Housing
Development proposals within the Downtown Core:
a. Promote a mix of uses with retail on the street level and office
and residential uses above street level. An increase in
residential units, providing "round the clock" population, will
help to reinvigorate the downtown core with activity, including
retail, office, and passive recreation.
b. Coordinate development with, and encourage use by residents of,
the rail line stop that is located within the Overlay District.
c. Maintain a design form in placement of buildings that will
encourage walkability by placing buildings at or close to the
edge of sidewalks that will, with architecture and window
displays at the street level, promote visual interest.
d. Coordinate infrastructure and streetscape enhancements with the
public sector and other developments within the district. New
development shall propose improvements to the public
infrastructure including traffic controls, sidewalks,
crosswalks, street lighting, underground utilities, street
trees, and landscaping including window boxes and modest
planters. A well-designed streetscape will contribute to a
sense of safety and of the walkability of the area. Safe and
convenient sidewalks leading through blocks to parking areas and
other public spaces shall be part of the design and shall
include ample street lighting as well as highly visible
landscaping and landscape screening of less appealing vistas.
Wayfinding signage shall coordinate with the overall district
wayfinding system, to assist pedestrians and drivers in locating
their destinations, public parking areas, and public transit.
e. Promote creativity and variety. The IHZ design standards are
meant to promote creativity and variety in building design.
f. Promote sustainable and energy-efficient design and
construction. Sustainable construction techniques and materials
shall, to the extent practicable be incorporated into new
construction and, to the extent practicable, renovation and
rehabilitation projects. Energy efficiency shall be a central
goal in selection of lighting, windows, materials, insulation,
and HVAC systems. Buildings shall be sited, oriented, and
designed with orientation to the sun and wind in mind as well.
Applicants shall consider certification by LEED or similar
rating programs, including any requirements to utilize such
programs as well as the use of low-impact development
techniques.
113
g. Protect and preserve the historic character of specific
buildings in the downtown Core, including the railroad station,
the "Hall-Elton" building, and the retail block at the southeast
corner of Quinnipiac Street and South Cherry Street.
2. North Cherry Street Sub-District. This area of the IHZ includes three
parcels with six existing buildings on 4.29 acres of developable land
as defined in General Statutes §§ 8-13m(3), all of which are
industrial uses or are abandoned. Moving the train station platform
to the north a sufficient distance from Quinnipiac Street and Hall
Avenue to eliminate cross-town traffic congestion created by stopped
trains would be beneficial. Therefore, the intent of this subdistrict
is to allow transit uses – primarily a new train platform and
station which would serve the needs of the commuter rail as well as
existing Amtrak service - and to encourage residential uses and office
and limited retail uses. Development on the west side of North Cherry
Street is primarily residential, and the goal is to create a
neighborhood that provides a transition between those residential uses
and the non-residential uses to the east, including the commuter rail
facility. The following principles shall be utilized for developing
and reviewing Incentive Housing Development proposals within the North
Cherry Street sub-district:
a. Promote a form of building placement and site design that
creates a landscape that is somewhere between a village and an
urban setting. The three largest existing buildings in this
sub-district have the potential for adaptive reuse into
residential units, and applicants shall make use of the existing
buildings to the extent practicable. To the extent feasible, new
development shall be designed with setbacks consistent with
shall not be located between the building and the street.
b. Coordinate infrastructure improvements with the public sector.
As in the other sub-districts, create an environment that is
conducive to walking and use of non-vehicular modes of
transportation. A sidewalk exists along the west side of the
street in this sub-district, and any project within this subdistrict
shall include construction of a sidewalk on the east
side, crosswalks, street lighting, and street trees. A welldesigned
streetscape contributes to an improved sense of safety
and walkability, which is critical in this sub-district given
the rail facility. Safe and convenient sidewalks leading to the
train station as well as any other public spaces shall be part
of the design for all projects, and shall include ample lighting
and landscaping. Where applicable, wayfinding signage shall be
installed that coordinates with an overall district wayfinding
system to assist pedestrians and drivers in locating their
destinations and public transit.
c. Promote creativity and variety in development. The IHZ design
standards are meant to promote creativity and variety in
building design. Given the limited size of this sub-district, a
variety of building styles is not practical, but if the three
largest buildings are retained, diversity will occur. New
development shall be designed to complement but not mimic the
adjacent properties, including the properties on the west side
of North Cherry Street.
d. Promote sustainable and energy-efficient design and
construction. Sustainable construction techniques and materials
shall, to the extent applicable be incorporated into new
construction and, to the extent practicable, renovation and
rehabilitation projects. Energy efficiency shall be a central
Formatted: Indent: Left: 1.5", First line: 0"
114
goal in selection of lighting, windows, materials, insulation,
and HVAC systems. Sites shall be sited, oriented, and designed
with orientation to the sun and wind in mind as well.
Applicants shall consider certification by LEED or similar
rating programs, including any requirements to utilize such
programs as well as the use of low-impact
development techniques.
3. Meadow Street Sub-District. This small area currently has five
parcels and four structures on 0.69 acres of developable land as
defined in General Statutes §§ 8-13m(3). There are currently nine
units in the four residential buildings within this sub-district, and
no other uses. The parcels directly across Meadow Street and Church
Street from this sub-district are residential, and the intent of this
sub-district is to maintain a residential character. To that end,
non-residential uses are not permitted under the IHZ Overlay Zoning in
this sub-district. The following principles shall be utilized for
developing and reviewing Incentive Housing Development proposals
within the Meadow Street sub-district:
a. Maintain a village form of design and building placement. In
contrast to the Downtown Core Sub-District, the Meadow Street
Sub-District is in a dense residential area where small front
lawns with landscaping and picket fences are appropriate.
Parking facilities shall not dominate the streetscape, and such
facilities shall have as little impact on the streetscape as
possible.
b. Coordinate infrastructure improvements with the public sector.
As in the other sub-districts, create an environment that is
conducive to walking. A sidewalk already exists along the
street frontages in this sub-district, and any project within
this sub-district shall include improvements to the sidewalk,
crosswalks, street lighting, and street trees.
c. Promote creativity and variety in development. While there is
limited space in this sub-district to incorporate multiple
building designs, incorporate a variety of architectural details
within the building design to add visual interest appropriate to
a dense residential neighborhood.
d. Promote sustainable and energy-efficient design and
construction. Sustainable construction techniques and materials
shall, to the extent practicable be incorporated into new
construction and, to the extent practicable, renovation and
rehabilitation projects. Energy efficiency shall be a central
goal in selection of lighting, windows, materials, insulation,
and HVAC systems. Applicants shall consider certification by
LEED or similar rating programs, including any requirements to
utilize such programs as well as the use of low-impact
development techniques.
E. Permitted Uses and Dimensional Requirements. The following uses are
permitted subject to Site Plan Approval in accordance with §4.23G.

dimensional requirements for new buildings.
6. The Commission may waive the requirement for minimum lot size only if
the following criteria are met:
a. The proposed Incentive Housing Development will eliminate
existing structures that contribute to the unsightly or
depressed appearance of the district;
b. Either the adjacent properties are not within the Incentive
Housing Zone or are not available for consolidation with the
proposed Incentive Housing Development; and
c. The scale, architectural design, and site design of the proposed
Incentive Housing Development complement the surrounding
properties and will not create undue adverse impacts on such
properties.
116
d. The Commission may waive the minimum lot size for the privately
owned portions of a public-private partnership project where it
is in the best interest of the Town to retain ownership of a
portion of the redevelopment site.

neighboring buildings. When a garage must be located
adjacent to the street, setbacks may be increased by the
Commission to allow for trees to be planted to provide
visual softening of the upper levels of the structure.
Formatted: Indent: Left: 1"
Formatted: Indent: Left: 1", Hanging: 0.5"
117
ii. The ground level of parking structures shall be separated
from the public sidewalks with retail building space,
unless a suitable alternative is proposed. Landscaping in
combination with architectural details on otherwise blank
walls of a garage may be a suitable alternative where
there is insufficient space for a building.
iii. Garage access points shall be clearly identified with
architectural elements and signage.
iv. Garage access points shall be located to minimize the
impact of vehicular turning movements on safe and
efficient movement of pedestrians, cyclists, and other
vehicles, and shall not be located within fifty (50) feet
of any street intersection.
v. Signage and light fixtures within the parking structure
shall not directly illuminate or produce disability glare
on adjacent properties.
f. Surface Parking:
i. Parking shall not be located in front yards unless there
is no possible alternative and only for renovation of

require a greater amount of landscaping to reduce the
impact of the parking on the streetscape.
ii. Parking shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from
front property lines.
iii. Parking that is visible from streets or public sidewalks
shall be screened with a combination of landscaping and
wrought-iron fencing, brick walls, stone walls, or earthen
berms, such that the screening is a minimum of three (3)
feet higher than the level of the parking lot and forms a
substantially opaque screen.
iv. Landscaping around and within parking lots shall be
designed with low-impact development techniques to allow
storm water runoff to drain into the landscaped areas to
supplement irrigation and to pre-treat the runoff.
v. The use of permeable pavements or surface materials is
encouraged to allow infiltration of storm-water runoff.
g. Solid waste receptacles shall be located and designed for ease
of access of solid waste removal services to the site and must
be located within a garage (trash cans) or in a free-standing
"trash house" (dumpsters). A trash house shall be designed with
architectural details to incorporate it into the overall
development and to minimize aesthetic impacts. Gates shall be
designed to be self-closing.

3. Professional Consultant Review Fees. When the Commission determines
that a peer-review of the technical aspects of an application for an
Incentive Housing Development is required to enable the Commission to
render a reasonable decision, the Commission may require, after notice
of estimated amount, the Applicant to pay the fees for professional
consultants. Such fees shall be estimated and documented for the
Town, in writing, by the professional consultant that will conduct the
peer review. The fee shall be provided in full to the Town prior to
the Town entering into an agreement or contract with the professional
consultant and prior to the commencement of any work on the peer
review by the professional consultant. Such fees shall be accounted
for separately by the Town from other moneys and maintained in an
interest-bearing account and used only for expenses associated with
the technical review of the application by consultants who are not
otherwise salaried employees of the Town or the Commission. Any amount
in the account remaining after payment of all expenses for technical
review, including any interest accrued, shall be returned to the
Applicant no later than forty-five (45) days after the completion of
technical review.
4. Referrals to Town Agencies. The Commission may refer copies of an
Incentive Housing Application to other Town agencies as necessary to

General Statutes, as applicable.
7. An application for an Incentive Housing Development shall be approved
by the Commission provided it is consistent with the Wallingford
Zoning Regulations.
8. Conditions shall be imposed on an Incentive Housing Development
approval by the Commission only as necessary:
a. to ensure substantial compliance of the proposed development
with the requirements of the incentive housing zone regulations
including the design standards, or
b. to mitigate any extraordinary adverse impacts of the development
on nearby properties.
9. An application for an Incentive Housing Development may be denied only
if:
a. the development does not meet the requirements set forth in the
Wallingford Incentive Housing Zone regulations, or
b. the Applicant failed to submit information and fees required by
the Regulations and necessary for an adequate and timely review
of the design of the Incentive Housing Development or potential
development impacts, or
119
c. it is not possible to adequately mitigate significant adverse
project impacts on nearby properties by means of conditions
acceptable to the Applicant.
d. The Applicant refuses to pay for reasonable professional
consultant review fees.
H. Incentive Housing Requirements
1. The following regulations shall govern the residential units in an
Incentive Housing Development:
a. Twenty percent (20%) of all dwelling units constructed in an
Incentive Housing Development shall be Incentive Housing Units.
When a calculation performed under this subsection results in a
number that includes a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded
up to the next whole number.
b. Incentive Housing Units shall be rented or sold to and occupied
only by Eligible Households.
c. Each Incentive Housing Unit shall be subject to an Incentive
Housing Restriction, which shall be recorded on the Wallingford
Land Records. All Incentive Housing Restrictions must include,
at a minimum, the following:
i. A description of the Incentive Housing Development,
including whether the Incentive Housing Units, at the time
of initial occupancy, will be rented or owner-occupied.
ii. An identification of the Incentive Housing Units.
iii. The name and address of the Incentive Housing
Administrator.
iv. A requirement that only an Eligible Household may reside
in an Incentive Housing Unit.
v. The formula pursuant to which rent of a rental unit or the
maximum sale or resale price of a homeownership unit will
be calculated.
vi. The term of the Incentive Housing Restriction, which shall
be a minimum of fifty (50) years, calculated on a per unit
basis from the date of the initial residential occupancy
of each Incentive Housing Unit.
vii. Provision for monitoring and enforcement of the terms and
provisions of the Incentive Housing Restriction by the
Commission.
viii. Provision that the Incentive Housing Administrator shall
file an annual report to the Commission, in a form
specified by the Commission, certifying compliance with
the provisions of this §4.23.
I. Building Design Standards
1. Proposed development projects shall complement the scale and
architecture of adjacent buildings, once a streetscape has been
established through redevelopment. For early projects, new
construction will set the stage for future redevelopment, and shall be
constructed to meet the goals of the IHZ to the greatest extent
practicable (i.e. maximum height, minimum setbacks, greatest density,
etc.).
2. In the Downtown Core Sub-District, buildings shall be placed within
two (2) feet of the edge of the sidewalk, or at the property line if
it is greater than two (2) feet from the edge of the sidewalk or
public right-of-way. Waivers may be granted to this requirement for
buildings with restaurants designed with café type outdoor seating
areas or where architectural renderings or models of the existing and
proposed streetscape for the project and surrounding properties are
120
presented which clearly show a public benefit to the alternative
building placement being proposed.
3. Façades
a. Buildings more than sixty (60) feet in length shall be broken
down into a series of smaller elements or "bays" to evoke the
rhythm of historic shop fronts and mixed use town centers and to
add to the visual character and maintain the pedestrian scale of
the streetscape. To accomplish this, façades on such buildings
shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a
depth of at least two (2) feet which extend at least twenty
percent (20%) of the length of the façade.
b. Ground-floor façades that face public streets shall have display
windows, entry doors with awnings, fanlights, or other such
features that emphasize a pedestrian scale.
c. No uninterrupted length of any façade, whether at ground level
or on upper stories, shall be permitted to exceed the lesser of
forty percent (40%) of the total length of the façade or forty
(40) feet without incorporating a change in color, material, or
texture and a projection, recess, window, balcony, trellis, or
similar architectural feature.
d. Façade design shall incorporate a distinction between the ground
level floor and the upper stories, using banding, smaller
windows on upper stories, balconies, and other architectural
elements that are appropriate to the scale and design of the
building.
e. Placement of windows and other major architectural features on
upper stories of a building façade shall, to the extent
practicable, align with those of adjacent buildings, and shall
be arranged with a balanced spacing and evident rhythm. Windows
shall also align vertically with those of stories above and/or
below. To modulate their scale, multi-story buildings shall
articulate the base, middle, and top by separating with
cornices, string cornices, step-backs, or other articulating
features. See Figure 2.3.M.
f. Blank wall surfaces greater than twenty (20) feet along the
horizontal plane of the building are prohibited at the street
level on any building façade adjacent to a sidewalk or public
way, with the exception of façades facing the railroad right-ofway.
g. Where blank wall surfaces are permitted, wall panels, pilasters,
building bays, or other architectural elements shall be carried
across the blank surface to relieve uninteresting façades. A
waiver may be granted by the Commission to this requirement for
façades that are within, or will be within, ten (10) feet of an
adjacent building and therefore not visible from the public
ways.
h. Side and rear façades which are visible from the public ways
shall be articulated in a manner compatible with the design of
the front façade.
4. Materials and Colors
a. New building materials shall be selected to convey a sense of
quality, durability, and permanence, and shall be economically
maintained and able to retain their appearance over time.
b. Building façade materials permitted within the district include
brick, wood, stone, cementitious fiber board, manufactured
limestone, cast stone, masonry, terra cotta, cellular PVC trim,
and sustainable materials. Brick is the preferred material in
the Downtown Core and North Cherry Street Sub-Districts, and
121
should be chosen as the primary façade material; other materials
may be used as discussed below.
Clapboards made of wood or cementitious fiber board are the
preferred material in the Meadow Street Sub-District.
c. Full size brick veneer is preferable to brick tile veneer, and
all brick veneers shall be mortared to give the appearance of
structural brick. If used, brick tile veneer shall use
wraparound corner and bull nose pieces to minimize the
appearance of the thin brick veneer.
d. Stone and stone veneers are appropriate as a basic building
material or as a secondary material for architectural elements
such as window sills or lintels in combination with other
materials such as brick or concrete.
e. Poured-in-place concrete or pre-cast concrete are appropriate as
a basic building material provided special consideration is
given to formwork, pigments, and aggregates to create a rich
surface. If such material is used as a primary surface
material, then brick, stone, or tile must be used as a secondary
material to add visual interest.
f. A combination of materials is encouraged to create visual
interest, especially on larger buildings. Where used, the
heavier material (stone, brick, concrete) shall be located below
lighter materials (wood, cementitious fiber board), and the
change in material shall occur along a horizontal line,
preferably at floor level.
g. Façade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or
earth-tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic
colors, black or fluorescent colors is prohibited.
h. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors
including primary colors, but neon tubing shall not be an
acceptable feature for building trim or accent areas.
i. The use of vinyl siding, smooth faced concrete block, tilt-up
concrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels as an exterior
surface is prohibited.
5. Windows and Doorways
a. Windows shall be inset a minimum of four (4) inches from the
exterior wall surface to add visual relief to the wall.
b. Windows shall be taller than they are wide, regardless of
whether they are on the ground level or upper stories.
c. Windows on the upper stories shall generally be smaller than
those on the ground floor.
d. All windows on upper stories shall have visually prominent
sills, lintels, or other such forms of architectural framing.
e. Recessed doorways are preferred, to break up the building
façade, provide a welcoming space, and provide protection from
the weather. Where a recessed doorway is not used, an awning or
similar architectural overhang shall be used. Adequate lighting
for the doorway shall be incorporated into the design of the
doorway.
6. Roofs
a. Roof forms shall complement the principal building in terms of
style, detailing, and materials.
b. Roof forms shall, where practicable, be varied within a block,
and may be varied within a building, and shall include sloped
roofs, parapets, decorative cornice treatments, decorative
soffits, overhangs a minimum of three (3) feet, dormers,
cupolas, or other architectural elements to complement the
building without creating a cluttered visual appearance.
122
c. Flat roofs shall be screened from public view using parapets or
other architectural elements. Outdoor living space may be
constructed on roofs, provided the floor and lower three (3)
feet of such space will not be visible from public view on
abutting streets. Railings may be built into the exterior roof
treatment (parapet, etc.) at other sides of the building.
d. Mechanical equipment, metal chimneys, and elevator shafts on a
roof shall be screened from public view using parapets or other
architectural elements.
e. In the Downtown Core Sub-District, four story buildings shall
incorporate mansard roofs with dormers for the fourth story, or
a strong cornice at the floor level of the fourth story, or for
large buildings, a combination of the two in different sections
of the building, to reduce the imposing appearance of the
building.
f. Within the Meadow Street Sub-District, all roofs shall be sloped
at a pitch of at least thirty (30) degrees.
g. In the North Cherry Street Sub-District, four story buildings
shall incorporate mansard roofs with dormers for the fourth
story, to reduce the imposing appearance of the building.
J. Signs
1. Only wall signs, hanging signs, or signs permanently painted on
windows are permitted.
2. Lettering of signs shall be carved or incised into the surface of the
wall or plaque, or, in the case of permanent window signs, painted on
the interior surface of the glass.
3. One wall sign for each business is permitted on the front façade, as
well as on the rear façade of a mixed use building. The aggregate size
of all wall signs on a façade may not exceed one (1) square foot per
lineal foot of the building façade. When a building is located on a
corner, both the front and side façades shall be considered front
façades provided there are business entrances located at the street
level on the side of the building. When a building has a side which is
visible from the street, one wall sign is permitted which identifies
the building but not the individual businesses located within the
building, and such sign shall not exceed one (1) square foot per
lineal foot of the building side.
4. Wall signs shall not project more than twelve (12) inches from the
surface of the wall to which they are attached, and shall be located a
minimum of eighteen (18) inches from the corner of the building, a
minimum of thirty-six (36) inches from any other wall sign, and the
top of the sign shall not extend above the ground level floor.
5. One (1) hanging sign is permitted for each business on the ground
level. Such hanging sign shall be a maximum of six (6) square feet in
area (per face), shall project no more than three (3) feet from the
building, and must provide a minimum of eight (8) feet and maximum of
twelve (12) feet of clearance from the bottom of the sign to the
sidewalk directly below. Such hanging signs shall not be located so
as to interfere with any service or emergency vehicles.
6. Signs shall be illuminated by an external steady stationary light
source, shielded and directed solely at the sign. Internally lit
signs and any sign with blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or
other illuminating devices which have a changing light intensity,
123
brightness, or color, are prohibited, including electronic message
centers.
7. The provisions of § 6.9 B, regarding signs not requiring a permit,
shall apply within this overlay district.
K. Streetscapes
1. Where a proposed Incentive Housing Development abuts a street that
lacks a sidewalk, or where existing sidewalks are not in compliance
with applicable standards, the application shall include a proposal to
construct or improve the sidewalks abutting the project site. New or
improved sidewalks shall be a minimum width of 5 ft. in addition to
the paver strip required for the streetscape enhancements under this
section. The applicant for any Incentive Housing Development shall, to
the extent the costs are not so excessive as to render the entire
project financially infeasible, be responsible for construction of
"Town Standard Streetscape Enhancements" as depicted in Figure 2.3.N.
The Commission may include a condition on the site plan approval
specifying which, if any, of these enhancements will be required.
2. Streetscape enhancements may include new concrete curbs, concrete
sidewalks, driveways constructed to Town standards, brick paver bands,
concrete handicap pedestrian ramps with detectable warning strips,
grass utility strips, ornamental street lights, street trees, benches,
trash receptacles, and/or associated landscaping.
3. These enhancements shall be constructed in general conformance with
the Town's standards for like work and be approved by the Town
Engineer or his designee.
4. Within the Downtown Core Sub-District, landscape features that enhance
the pedestrian environment shall be included where practicable, such
as plazas, sitting areas, and outdoor seating for cafés.
L. Landscaping
1. All areas between the front of a building and the front property line
that are not occupied by driveways, sidewalks, or other approved
hardscape, shall be landscaped with grass or other living ground
cover, trees and shrubs. Landscape stone shall not be permitted in
front yards with the exception of small areas within planting beds and
as accent pieces within a vegetated landscape.
2. All plantings shall be native species. Invasive species, native or
non-native, are prohibited. Plantings near streets, parking areas, or
sidewalks shall be salt tolerant.
3. Street trees, if used, shall be planted in conformance with the Town's
standards, as depicted in Figure 2.3.O.
4. Landscaping improvements may include amenities such as street
furniture, artwork, fences, stone walls, fountains, and courtyards.
5. Preservation of existing trees is strongly recommended.
M. Site Lighting
1. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall have a total cutoff of all light
at ninety (90) degrees or less from vertical with the exception of
wall mounted fixtures at doorways, which shall be shielded from
emitting light upwards beyond an entry overhang or awning.
124
2. Lighting fixtures along sidewalks or pathways shall not exceed twelve
(12) feet in height, although the supporting poles may exceed that
height.
3. Poles supporting light fixtures shall be dark in color to reduce light
reflectivity.
4. All light fixtures shall emit a steady, constant light and shall not
emit a flashing or irregular light, unless specifically required by
Federal, State, or municipal authorities.
5. All outdoor light fixtures using metal halide lamps shall be shielded
and filtered, and quartz glass does not meet this filtering
requirement.

of street-level building frontage above 10 ft. that consists of
windows shall be at least 15% and shall not exceed 70%.
k. Separate and distinct entrances shall be required for first floor
and upper story uses. The entrance to the second floor use may
occupy a portion of the building frontage, but shall not exceed
10% of the length of the building frontage or 5 ft., whichever is
greater.
l. Entrances for uses that are on the ground floor but are not
located within the street-facing area of the building shall be
limited to one (1) within any 50 ft. of building frontage, and
shall not exceed 10% of the length of the building frontage or 5
ft., whichever is greater.
m. There shall be an entrance to at least some portion of the
building provided within at least every 100 ft. of building
frontage.
n. Maximum number of alleyways/walkways per lot from the rear of the
lot to the front of the building shall be limited to one (1).
This walkway/alleyway must have ample lighting and comply with
applicable public sidewalk standards, including an unobstructed
width of at least 5 ft. Any way finding signage shall be
compliant with §6.9 of these Regulations.
o. The entire front yard of a property, except for the area required
for an existing/approved driveway and/or sidewalks, shall be
composed of landscaping, public green/gathering space or other
amenity as approved by the Commissions, and/or outdoor dining.
p. Solid waste/recycling receptacles shall be grouped in one
designated area on each property, shall not be located in a front
yard, and shall be screened from view from other properties and
public rights-of-way by an enclosure and/or landscaping.
q. Mechanical equipment, HVAC equipment, metal chimneys, and
elevator shafts on a roof shall be placed or screened, so as not
to be visible from the public way or the grade level of any
adjacent properties.
r. Drive-through services shall not be permitted.
3. Parking Design
a. Existing Parking Layout – In situations in which the layout,
shape, size, and/or configuration of the existing lot and the
existing/remaining building area is such that all parking design
requirements cannot be complied with, or, if complied with, would
significantly reduce the number of parking spaces as currently
designed/utilized/configured, the Commission may determine, by
Special Permit, that certain existing non-compliant elements of
the parking lot (such as, but not limited to: aisle widths,
existing compact car spaces, landscaping, etc.) may be allowed to
continue. The Commission may require demonstration by the
applicant’s design professional as to the impact of full
compliance with current regulations on the number of parking
spaces which could be provided, and certification from an
appropriate professional (i.e. engineer) that the continuance of
the existing non-conformities proposed to remain will not create
a public safety hazard. In considering such Special Permit, the
Commission may consider applicable elements such as: property
140
limitations and existing building locations that limit the
physical ability to comply with the applicable requirements;
existing parking conditions and whether they have created any
significant safety/circulations issues to date; the number of
spaces that would be lost by bringing all parking up to current
standards; provision of appropriate connection to adjacent
parking area; safety associated with the proposed remaining nonconformities,
particularly as represented by a parking
professional; and other elements which the Commission deems
appropriate.
b. Access Management - In order to limit congestion, site line
issues, traffic accidents, and other circulation issues
attributable to poorly designed access systems; in order to
better allow for more safe pedestrian and vehicular circulation,
and to further the orderly layout and use of land, access
management will be required for any proposal involving new
construction or re-construction or any site modifications that
require a Special Permit associated with parking requirements.
Access Management requirements shall be as follows:
i. Where feasible, new access driveways shall be aligned with
existing driveways located on the opposite site of the road.
ii. Wherever possible, a drive or system of drive aisles
extending the entire block and located behind the buildings
shall be used to provide access to parking and loading. Such
driveways shall be compliant with the requirements of these
zoning regulations, except that, where it is demonstrated
that the required 24 ft. width is not possible or would
significantly limit the circulation and design of access and
parking areas, the Commission may reduce the drive width to
22 ft., based on review and approval by the Town Engineer.
iii. The maximum number of curb cuts per lot shall be 1, except
that properties that are located internally to a block (i.e.
do not front on more than 1 street) and have easements
granted to them to allow vehicular access across adjacent
property, no curb cuts shall be allowed. This restriction may
be modified by the Commission if it can be demonstrated that
an additional curb cut is necessary for reasons of public
safety and/or to improve circulation.
iv.In designing development, redevelopment, or site modifications,
properties shall provide vehicular cross access to and from
adjacent properties in order to create/perpetuate the single
drive or system of drive aisles to the rear of the block. An
easement shall be recorded on the Town Land Records allowing
such cross-access and including a shared maintenance
agreement, and stub-outs and other design features shall be
provided to provide for tie-in by abutting properties.
v. Upon application for development, redevelopment, or site
modifications, other curb cuts not consistent with this
section shall be eliminated wherever possible.
vi. The Commission may modify or waive the requirements of this
Section where the characteristics or layout of abutting
properties would make a development of a unified or shared
access and circulation system impractical.
4. Surface Parking – Parking areas, including landscaping, shall comply
with all applicable requirements of these Regulations, including §6.11
and §6.14, except as otherwise noted in this section.
141
a. Parking shall not be located in front yards unless it legally
exists at the time of application and unless there is no possible
alternative and only for renovation of, and/or additions to,
existing buildings (new buildings shall be located so as to place
parking behind them). In such cases the commission may require a
greater amount of landscaping to reduce the impact of the parking
on the streetscape and any area between the existing parking and
the front property line shall be landscaped in accordance with
the front landscaping requirements in §6.14.C of these
Regulations.
b. Parking that is visible from streets or public sidewalks shall be
screened with a combination of landscaping and fencing, brick or
stone walls, or earthen berms, such that the screening is a
minimum of three (3) feet higher than the level of the parking
lot and forms a substantially opaque screen, except where
vehicular, pedestrian, or bicycle access ways are located or
where screening must be reduced to allow for appropriate site
lines, as determined by the Commission.
c. Where parking is located in a backyard, no landscaped area along
the perimeter of the parking area shall be required, except on
any side on which the parking abuts a residential zone, in which
case the requirement shall be 5 ft.
d. Where applicable, landscaping requirements shall be reduced to
25% of the “internal landscaping” requirements in §6.14.E;
however, rather than being required to be located internal to the
parking area, this requirement may be located anywhere on the lot
as landscaping and/or gathering space that incorporates
landscaping anywhere on the lot, and may include natural and
landscaped areas, pedestrian plazas, courtyards, recreation areas
and the like.
e. Landscaping around and within parking lots shall be designed with
low-impact development techniques to allow storm water runoff to
drain into the landscaped areas to supplement irrigation and to
pre-treat the runoff. The use of permeable pavements or surface
materials is encouraged to allow infiltration of storm-water
runoff, subject to appropriate maintenance agreements by the
applicants and approval by the Town Engineer.
f. The parking surface shall be treated with bituminous pavement
products unless the Commission approves an alternative surface,
especially proposed brick or block porous pavement that is
specially designed to increase on-site water retention for plant
material and groundwater recharge and to reduce problems related
to runoff. In deciding on proposed alternatives, the Commission
shall consider the level of traffic generation of the proposed
use(s), acceptability of proposed maintenance provisions, and
ability of proposed surface to increase on-site water retention.
5. Parking Garages:
a. Garages shall be located underground or shall have a permitted
commercial or residential primary use for at least 50 ft. between
the parking structure or portion of the structure used for
parking and the frontage of the building, except that on corner
lots, this requirement shall only apply to the more primary
street, based on street classification. To minimize visibility
from public streets, scale and design shall match proportions of
neighboring buildings.
b. Subject to approval of a Special Permit, the Commission may
determine that, due to site constraints, a garage can only
142
reasonably be located adjacent to the street; in such case,
setbacks may be increased by the Commission to allow for trees to
be planted to provide visual softening of the upper levels of the
structure, and the Commission may impose such other form, height,
location, screening, or other requirements as it deems
appropriate.
c. Garage access points shall be clearly identified with
architectural elements and signage.
d. Garage access points shall be located to minimize the impact of
vehicular turning movements on safe and efficient movement of
pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, and shall not be
located within fifty (50) feet of any street intersection.
e. Signage and light fixtures within the parking structure shall not
directly illuminate or produce disability glare on adjacent
properties.
F. Parking Requirements – Parking requirements in the Town Center zone shall
be as below, and in accordance with §6.11 of these Regulations; when the
requirements of this Section are in contradiction to §6.11, the
requirements of this section shall apply in the Town Center Zone.
“Compliance with the current required number of parking spaces” as
referred to in this section may include approval of a Special Permit by
the Commission to utilize one or more of the provisions in §4.5.D.3.d to
reduce the total number of spaces required.
1. The minimum required number of parking spaces required shall be
calculated using the chart below, and shall supersede the chart in
§6.11.C.
Type of Use Minimum # of Parking Spaces to be Provided
Multi-family dwelling units
Studio/1 Bedrooms 1 /dwelling unit
2+ bedrooms 2/dwelling unit
Offices, financial institutions, 1/400 sq.ft. GFA
retail stores (including Retail
Restaurants), personal service shops

area
Bed and Breakfast 2 spaces for the owneroccupant
plus
143
1 space per guest bedroom
Other uses not listed above Parking facilities as
determined by the Commission
2. Parking Requirements for Changes of Use within Existing Buildings –
a. In the existing finished portion of a building, excluding any
basement area, that existed as of January 1, 2017, all uses
permitted in the TC zone shall be interchangeable and exempt from
providing any additional parking spaces above that which existed
as of January 1, 2017, as demonstrated by the most recently
approved and implemented plan or as determined by the Commission
or its agent. However, if any parking spaces that are not
reserved for a particular use/user as of June 1, 2018, are to
become reserved or are to be reserved for a different use
category, compliance with the site and number of parking spaces
shall be brought entirely into compliance with the current
parking requirements, except as per §4.26.E.3.aabove; such
compliance may include approval of a Special Permit by the
Commission to utilize one or more of the provisions in §4.5.F to
reduce the total number of spaces required.
b. However, the number of existing parking spaces as of January 1,
2017 may not be reduced unless compliance with the current
requirements is achieved.
3. Parking Requirements Applied to Additions to Existing GFA/Increases in
Residential Units – Whenever an addition to the GFA of a building or an
increase in the number of residential units on a property is proposed on a
site that is not compliant or would no longer be compliant with the
current minimum required number of parking spaces, the site and number of
parking spaces shall be brought entirely into compliance with the current
parking requirements, except as per §4.26.E.3.aabove; such compliance may
include approval of a Special Permit by the Commission to utilize one or
more of the provisions in §4.5.F to reduce the total number of spaces
required.
4. Reserved Parking:
a. Parking that is reserved for any specific use(s)/user(s)/use
category(-ies) on a mixed-use site shall:
• Not be counted in any “shared parking” calculation, and
• Not increase any existing non-conformities
b. In cases where the existing number of parking spaces is nonconforming,
the reservation of parking space(s) for any
existing/proposed use(s)/user(s)/use categories within the
existing building shall require an equal number of spaces to
otherwise be accounted for, subject to approval of a Special
Permit by the Commission, as follows:
i. Additional spaces may be physically constructed on the site;
ii. Additional spaces may be physically provided for on another
lot within 500 ft. of the property via perpetual agreement
filed on the land records, provided that the spaces used for
this provision are in excess of those required on said other
lot, for up to 50% of the total number of existing spaces on
the lot;
iii. Fees in lieu of the spaces may be paid using the equation in
Section 4.26.F.1.b.i.
iv. Other spaces may be made available to the general public in
accordance with Section 4.26.F.1.c.
144
v. Bicycle rack parking may be provided to account for 1 space,
in accordance with Section 4.26.F.1.d.
vi. The maximum number of spaces which may be reserved under this
provision shall not exceed 50% of the existing parking
spaces.
vii. This provision shall only apply when no new construction or
building/use expansions, increases, or additions are
proposed. Therefore, compliance with the entire current
parking requirement is not required per this section; only
those spaces being reserved will be required to be otherwise
accounted for per this section.
G. Reductions in Parking Requirements –
1. Subject to approval of a Special Permit, the Commission may allow for use
of one or more of the following options, the extent of which is to be
determined by the Commission. Under no circumstances shall the number of
parking spaces be permitted to be reduced below the minimum number of
parking spaces required for all dwelling units on the property.
a. Shared Parking for Different Peak-Peak Uses – Subject to approval of a
Special Permit by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the total
parking requirements for the TC zone may be modified to permit shared
parking based on the Parking Credit Schedule Chart below. Multiply the
minimum parking requirement for each individual use by the appropriate
percentage for each of the five (5) designated time periods and then
add the resulting sums for each vertical column. The column total
having the highest total value is the minimum shared parking space
requirement for that combination of land uses.

b. Fees In-Lieu of Parking Spaces – Subject to approval by the Commission
of a Special Permit in accordance with §7.5 and the requirements
below, and in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes, up to 65%
of the minimum parking requirement for a proposal by be met by payment
of a fee to the Town in lieu of the actual construction of the
required spaces.
i. Dedicated Fund for Fees in Lieu of Parking: If approved, the
required payment must be deposited in a fund established by the
Town pursuant to and in accordance with §8-2c of the Connecticut
General Statutes (as may be amended). Considerations: Such
Special Permit shall only be approved if the Commission (1)
finds that the number of minimum parking spaces required by
these Regulationswould result in an excess of parking spaces for
such use of land or in the area surrounding such use of land; or
145
(2) finds by a 2/3 vote that the number of minimum parking
spaces required by these Regulations could not be physically
located on the parcel of land for which such use is proposed.
Payment: The formula for the fee in lieu of parking shall be:
# of spaces for which fee is proposed X $2,000
= total fee
ii.One-hundred percent (100%) of the fee required by this regulation
and approved by the Commission shall be made to the Town prior
to the issuance of a Building Permit for the project for which
the fee was approved. Funds paid to the Town as a fee in lieu of
parking shall not be refundable for any reason. Such funds shall
be used only as permitted by Connecticut General Statutes §8-2c,
as amended; however, nothing herein shall be deemed to require
the Town to undertake the acquisition, construction, expansion
or development of any particular off-street public parking
facility.
c. Parking Made Available to the General Public – The Planning and Zoning
Commission may, subject to a Special Permit application and approval,
allow privately owned/developed parking spaces that are made
permanently available to the general public to be granted additional
credit toward meeting the minimum parking requirement on a site as
follows:
i. A designated space approved by Special Permit under this
provision, which is made available to the general public at all
hours may be counted as up to 1.5 spaces, ad determined by the
Commission.
ii. A designated space that is made permanently available to the
general public only for evening hours of 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.
may be counted as up to 1.3 spaces, as determined by the
Commission.
iii. The manner in which parking spaces approved by Special Permit
under this section are made “permanently available to the
general public” shall be a manner acceptable to and approved by
the Commission, and shall include allowing all members of the
general public to park in the designated space within the
requirements of this section and appropriate designation of each
space as public parking and posting of permitted applicable
rules and restrictions.
iv. Any parking time limitation shall allow for a minimum parking
period of 8 hours, except where applicable for evening hours as
permitted above, where spaces shall allow parking for the entire
6 hour period.
v. There shall be no charge to the public for using the parking if
private ownership is retained.
vi. In considering such Special Permit application, the Commission
shall consider the elements noted in §4.5.D.and §7.5 as
applicable, as well as the following: Compliance with all
requirements of this section; the manner in which the spaces are
proposed to be designated as available to the general public;
the location of the proposed spaces to be designated as spaces
available to the general public including their proximity to
other public parking spaces and to one another; the general
accessibility of these spaces as well as their accessibility
from other public parking areas and from one another; the
146
centrality of these spaces in accessing nearby businesses; the
proximity of these spaces to nearby businesses; the number of
spaces proposed to be designated as available to the general
public and their usefulness to the public based on that number;
the visibility of these spaces to the general public when
looking for parking in the vicinity of the site; the need for
additional public parking in the vicinity of the site; and other
elements which the Commission deems appropriate.
d. Bicycle Parking: Subject to approval by the Commission of an
application for a Special Permit, a bicycle rack (or multiple racks)
containing a number of bicycle spaces to be determined by the
Commission may be provided to replace up to one (1) of the required
parking spaces. In considering such Special Permit application, the
Commission shall consider whether the provision of the bicycle parking
spaces adequately eliminates the need for the auto parking space(s)
that they are proposed to replace. Such bicycle racks shall be:
i. Located on pavement or other hard surface that is adjacent to
and accessible via a sidewalk or other safely accessible bicycle
travel route
ii. At the same grade as the sidewalk or access route
iii. Within 50 ft. of a main entrance to the (or one of the)primary
building(s)
iv. Be securely and permanently anchored
v. Designed such that the frame of a bicycle and one wheel can be
locked to the rack with a high security u-shaped shackle lock if
both wheels are left on the bicycle, and a bicycle six feet long
can be securely held with its frame supported.
2. In considering a Special Permit application to utilize any of the options
for reduction in parking requirements as provided in this Section, the
Commission shall consider whether the proposed parking lot layout is
designed to coordinate circulation and layout with any adjacent parking
areas, to maximize efficiency of the parking area in terms of: number of
spaces that can be created, access to public parking spaces by the
general public, traffic safety, and ease of circulation, with particular
attention to compliance with the access management requirements in this
section, as determined by the Commission. The Commission may also require
the provision of streetscape improvements on the property or within the
right-of-way directly abutting the subject property, in order to maximize
ease and safety of pedestrian access, and to encourage use of pedestrian
access in place of or in addition to vehicle use. The applicant shall
also, to the extent practicable as determined by the Commission, limit
the number and location of solid waste and recycling-+ receptacles,
including providing for multiple tenants to share receptacles and/or the
location of the receptacles.
3. In considering any applications for Special Permit under this section,
the Commission may require submittal of parking studies, data, and/or any
other documentation in regard to the request which the Commission deems
appropriate.
4. In considering any applications for Special Permit under this section,
the Commission shall consider: Availability of public/on-street parking
within the vicinity of the subject property; access management; peak
hours associated with the proposed use(s); physical capability of the lot
to support additional parking; demonstration by the applicant of
147
sufficiency of proposed number of parking spaces; and other elements
which the Commission deems appropriate.

§6.5 FLOOD PLAIN REGULATIONS
06/18/00
A. Purpose:
Note - For the purpose of this section only:
a. Manufactured home shall mean a structure, transportable in one or
more sections which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to
be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel
trailers, recreational vehicles and similar transportable structures
placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to
be improved property.
b. Structure shall mean a walled and roofed building, including a gas
or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well
as a manufactured home.
1. To protect human life and health,
2. to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects,
3. to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public,
4. to minimize prolonged business interruptions,
5. to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard,
6. to help maintain a stable tax base providing for the use and
development of areas of special flood hazard, while minimizing future
flood blight areas,
7. to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard, and
8. to ensure that those who occupy the area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
B. Location:
The special flood hazard areas within the Town of Wallingford are
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for New Haven County, Connecticut, dated
May 16, 2017, accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated
May 16, 2017(Panels – 09009CO163J,09009CO164J,09009CO284J,09009CO302J,
09009CO303J,09009CO304J,09009CO307J,09009CO309J,09009CO311J,09009CO312J,
09009CO314J,09009CO316J,09009CO317J,09009CO318J,09009CO336J), and
December 17, 2010 (Panels- 09009CO168H,09009CO301H,09009CO306H,
09009CO0308H,09009CO330H),and other supporting data applicable to the
Town of Wallingford, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. Since mapping is
legally adopted by reference into this ordinance it must take precedence
when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision
is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any
area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as
floodway on a FIRM. Areas of special flood hazard are determined
utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)are only approximate (rounded
up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for
a specific location. A copy of this report is on file in the Planning
160
Department. 05/16/17, 12/17/10
C. Requirements for Development:
Any proposed building structure, or use located in Zones A, AE, as
delineated on the FIRM, shall conform to the following requirements:
1. All Buildings and Structures
a. Buildings and structures shall be designed with low flood damage
potential.
b. Buildings and structures shall be constructed and placed on the lot
so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters.
c. Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may
result in damage to other structures.
d. Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
either be constructed at or above the elevation of the area of
special flood hazard, or be otherwise structurally flood-proofed.
e. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings
that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
1. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum criteria:
(a) provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding.
(b) the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade, and
(c) openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the
automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
2. Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are
prohibited below the base flood elevation.
3. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises
(standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway
or elevator).
2. Residential Buildings - New construction and substantial improvement of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including the
basement, elevated to at least two feet above the base flood elevation,
or higher, as determined by the Commission. 01/17/93, 09/19/93
3. Non-residential Construction - New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a. Be flood-proofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water;
b. have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
c. be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
161
that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certifications shall be provided to the Town Engineer.
4. Manufactured Homes
a. Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with §6.5.D.1.
b. For new manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions,
for expansions to existing manufactured home parks and manufactured
home subdivisions; for newly placed or substantially improved
manufactured homes placed in existing manufactured home parks; and
for manufactured homes not placed in a manufactured home park or
manufactured home subdivision, and for manufactured homes placed in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a
flood, require that: 12/17/10
1. Stands or lots shall be elevated on compacted fill or on
pilings so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home shall
be at or above the base flood level.
2. Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler shall be
provided.
3. In the instance of elevation on pilings, that: lots shall be
large enough to permit steps; piling foundations shall be
placed in stable soil no more than ten feet apart, and
reinforcement shall be provided for pilings more than six feet
above the ground level.
4. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within special
flood hazard areas must be either on the site for fewer than
180 consecutive days and be fully licenses and ready for
highway use, or meet the elevation and anchoring requirements
of a manufactured home required in Sections 6.5.C.4 and
6.5.D.1. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if
it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has not permanently attached additions. 12/17/10
5. Floodways - Within the floodway, designated on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map and those determined as a result of C.6, all encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements to
existing structures, repairs to substantially damaged structures and
other developments shall be prohibited unless certification, with
supporting technical data, by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in
flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences
in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open
design. 12/17/10
6. Standards for watercourses without established base flood elevations
(un-numbered A zone), adopted floodways and/or flood mapping.
a. The Commission shall require base flood elevation (BFE)
data be provided with any application for new construction,
substantial improvement, repair to structures which have
sustained substantial damage or other development in Zone A
without FEMA-published BFE(un-numbered A Zone). The
Commission shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
BFE and floodway data available from a federal, state or
other source, including data developed for
subdivision proposals, as criteria for requiring that new
162
construction, substantial improvements, repair to
structures which have sustained substantial damage or other
development in un-numbered A Zones on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)meet the standards in Sections
6.5C and 6.5D. If no BFE can be determined, the lowest
floor, including basement, must be elevated to two (2) feet
above the highest adjacent grade next to the structure.
b. When BFEs have been determined with Zones A and AE on the
community’s FIRM but a regulatory floodway has not been
designated, the Commission must require that no new
construction, substantial improvements, repair to
structures which have sustained substantial damage or other
development, including fill, shall be permitted which
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community
when all existing and anticipated development is considered
cumulatively with the proposed development.
12/17/10
c. The Commission may request floodway data of an applicant
for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When
such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data
is available from any other source (in response to the
municipality’s request or not), the community shall adopt a
regulatory floodway base on the principle that the floodway
must be able to convey the waters of the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation more than
one (1.0) foot at any point within the community.
7. Standards for Development in Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO
Zone)-Located within the special flood hazard areas are areas
designated as shallow flooding areas (AO Zones). These areas
have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1)
to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not
exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate. In AO zones, the following provisions apply:
a. For residential structures, all new construction,
substantial improvements and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least two feet above the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), in feet above the highest adjacent grade.
If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated, at least two feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
b. For non-residential structures, all new construction,
substantial improvements and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage shall:
i. Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent grade.
If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet
above the highest adjacent grade; or
ii. together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be completely flood-proofed to or above the depth
number, in feet, specified on the FIRM above the highest
adjacent grade, or if no depth number is specified at
163
least two feet above the highest adjacent grade, so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects
of buoyancy. Designs for complying with this
requirement must be certified by either a Connecticut
licensed professional engineer or architect.
c. On-site drainage for all proposed structures in AO Zones
located on slopes shall provide adequate drainage paths to
guide flood waters around and away from such structures.
d. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor in AO Zones must
comply with the provisions of Section 6.5.C.1.e for
hydraulic flood vents.
8. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the
floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced,
shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new
construction or substantial improvements involving an increase
in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by
deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be
provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from
adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood
storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally
equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each
elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation,
which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such
compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic
connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory
storage can be provided off-site if approved by the
municipality.
9. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas
which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments
resulting from filling, new construction or substantial
improvements involving an increase in footprint of the
structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides
certification by a registered professional engineer
demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that
such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase
in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the
floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including
work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in
such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or
flood velocity. 12/17/10
D. General Standards:
Within Zones A, and AE, the following standards shall be met prior to
issuance of a Building Permit for any proposed construction/development:
1. Anchoring
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement
of the structure;
164
b. All new or substantially improved manufactured homes or
manufactured home parks to be placed in an area of special
flood hazard shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground
anchors. Specific requirements shall be that:
1. Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of the
manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at
intermediate locations, with manufactured homes less than 50
feet long requiring one additional tie per side;
2. Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points, with
manufactured homes less then 50 feet long requiring four
additional ties per side;
3. All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a
force of 6240 pounds; and
4. Any addition to the manufactured home shall be similarly
anchored.
2. Construction Material and Methods
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage, and with materials and utility equipment resistant
to flood damage.
3. Utilities
a. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into flood waters;
c. On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
4. Subdivision Proposals
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
d. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at
least 50 lots 5 acres.
5. Above-Ground Storage Tanks – Above-ground storage tanks (oil,
propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure
must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a
concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent
flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended
above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the
infiltration of flood water.
6. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone – If any portion of a structure
lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire
structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must
meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure
includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any
other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches
that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the
entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
165
7. Structures in Two Flood Zones – If a structure lies within two or
more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive
zone apply to the entire structure (i.e, V zone is more restrictive
than zone; structure must be built to the highest BRE). The
structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms,
or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or
porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the
entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive
zone.)
8. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water – New construction,

§6.8 OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISION
01/19/02
A. The purpose of this section is to provide a method of development for
land which permits variation in lot sizes for one-family dwellings in
R-18, RU-40, RU-80 and RU-120 Districts for the purpose of protecting
surrounding properties, persons and neighborhoods; to provide for
future parks and/or recreation areas. Also, by encouraging minimal
lengths of public roadways to ensure proper surface drainage, flood
control and soil conservation; to promote the preservation and
protection of existing trees, ground cover, topsoil, streams, rock
outcroppings and scenic and historical sites from dangers and damage
caused by excessive and poorly planned grading for streets and building
sites and to minimize future municipal maintenance and repair expenses
in such neighborhoods.
B. The Commission may grant approval to an application for an open space
development of single-family detached residences, subject to a Special
Permit in accordance with §7.5 and upon the following conditions:
1. Lot area standards for all lots specified in these regulations
shall be as per §6.8.C. of the Town of Wallingford Zoning
Regulations.
2. The tract shall be a contiguous tract in single ownership or
consolidated into a single contiguous tract by a number of
different owners by means of a binding agreement which will
assure the uniform treatment and implementation of an overall
open space plan for the entire tract from the time of application
and continuing thereafter.
3. The tract shall be at least 10 acres in size in an R-18 zone, 15
acres in an RU-40 zone, and at least 25 acres in RU-80 and RU-120
zones.
4. The total number of proposed residences shall be determined by
dividing the total acreage of the tract minus,
a. actual proposed roadway right-of-way area,
b. all wetland and watercourse areas,
c. land and slopes in excess of 25 percent,
d. floodway and floodplain areas,
e. land subject to easement for above-ground utility
transmission lines
by the conventional minimum lot size for the district in which
the tract is located.
5. No lots shall be proposed with required frontage on, or access
to, Town roads not built as part of an open space subdivision. A
minimum open space area of 60 feet from the property line shall
be
maintained in the subdivision along Town roads that are not part
of an open space development. A Conservation Easement with
restrictions acceptable to the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall be placed on this open space area to maintain it in its
natural state. If this 60 foot area is an existing lawn or
meadow, a mixture of evergreen and deciduous seedlings shall be
planted at a minimum density of one (1) every 25 sq.ft.
6. Land shall be set aside for conservation, park and/or recreation
purposes, the total area of which shall not be less than 60% of
the total net acreage in RU-120 and RU-80 districts and 40% of

the total net acreage in RU-40 and R-18 districts; “net acreage”
being defined as the area of the tract to be developed less any
land area required to be set aside for public streets. Areas
comprising slopes of more than 25%, wetlands, watercourses, land
subject to easements for above-ground public utility transmission
lines and floodplain as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map may comprise in combination no more than 40% of the required
open space. Also, the Commission may require at least 50% of the
proposed open space to be contiguous. For purposes of this
regulation the term “contiguous open space” may include roadway
crossings and culverts. Stormwater management ponds or basins
may be included as part of the minimum required open space.
7. The area proposed to be developed under the open space
subdivision provisions shall be served by public water and public
sewer mains and street lighting, as evidenced by a letter of
intent from the Wallingford Public Utilities Commission, except
that this requirement may be modified by the Commission in RU-40,
RU-80 and RU-120 districts provided technical evidence is
submitted by the developer that the use of individual wells and
individual septic tanks will not endanger the public health and
welfare of the area.
8. All interior roads shall comply with the standards specified in
the Town’s Subdivision Regulations except that pavement width may
be waived by the Commission. Street connections shall generally
be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be
maintained by the Town and to facilitate easy access to and from
homes in different parts of the property (and on adjoining
parcels). The Commission may require that cul-de-sacs be
designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and
shrubs.
9. Rear lots shall not be permitted in R-18 or RU-40 Open Space
Subdivisions.
10. Open Space:
A. The Commission recognizes that one of the Town’s assets is
its varied and unique physical features and open space. It
is necessary to preserve these natural assets by encouraging
development techniques, which will accomplish the objective
of preserving this asset. Open Space in an Open Space
Subdivision must accomplish one of the following objectives:

enhance the appearance, character and natural beauty of
an area.
2. Preserving land to serve park and recreation needs;
3. Preserving land for purposes of conserving natural
resources.

having qualities of natural beauty of historic interest.
5. Protecting streams, rivers, ponds and wetlands so as to
avoid flooding, erosion and water pollution.
6. Preserving and protecting agricultural areas as an
historic use of land in Wallingford.
7. Preserving open space to replicate a traditional New
England green.
8. Providing larger open space areas by laying out new open
space contiguous to existing open space on adjacent
parcels.
171
11. All open space area shall be preserved and maintained solely for
one or more of the purposes set forth in §6.8.B.11. of this
regulation and whose ownership shall be one of the following
methods:
a. By deed in fee simple to the owner of each lot in the Open
Space Subdivision of an undivided interest in the open
space area proportionate to the total number of lots in the
subdivision. Each lot owner shall be responsible for the
preservation and maintenance of the open space area
including payment of any expense in effecting such
purposes.
b. By deed in fee simple to the Town or to a land trust or
other non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation
of open space if acceptable to the Town or other entity.
12. Any additional lots created by resubdivision of property in an
existing Open Space or Cluster subdivision approved under these
regulations must comply with lot size, frontage and building
setback requirements of §5.1.A. of the Wallingford Zoning
Regulations. Any such resubdivision will be considered as
modification to an existing Open Space Subdivision Special Permit
and will be subject to all sections of §7.5. of the Wallingford
Zoning Regulations except that only properties abutting the
proposed re-subdivided properties must be notified as per
§7.5.D.1.c. of the Wallingford Zoning Regulations.
13. After subdivision maps have been filed, no property shown as open
space on an approved Open Space Subdivision may be re-subdivided
into buildable lots or made part of any new or existing building
lot.
14. All open space shown on an approved subdivision map shall be left
in its natural state unless otherwise approved by the Commission.
Any use of this open space not approved by the Commission,
including, but not limited to, lawn and garden encroachments, the
dumping of both biodegradable and non-biodegradable material, and
filling, shall be considered a violation of these regulations and
enforcement action may be taken.

In reviewing all plans, the Commission shall take into consideration
the public health, safety and welfare, the general objectives of
Site Plan Review and the following specific considerations:
1. The Commission shall consider the location, intensity and type
of operation contemplated in each application. The Commission
may impose conditions for safety of operations and to prevent
184
damage to adjacent lands or improvements, including the
specifications of appropriate performance standards.
2. Filling with and/or removing earth products shall be restricted to
areas which have access to roads of sufficient width and capacity to
carry maximum projected loads. When alternate routes are available,
such traffic shall avoid routes which require passage through
residential areas.
3. Location shall be avoided where it is anticipated that the activity may
cause slides, sinking, collapse of supporting soil, erosion by wind or
water, water pollution, undue alteration of the water table of
adjoining properties or any other deleterious effects.
4. Activities shall also be reviewed with respect to the condition of the
site after completion of the operation and the relationship of that
site to existing and permitted development in the general area in which
the site is located. The applicant's proposed Restoration Plan for the
site shall demonstrate the extent to which the site can, and reliably
will, be restored to condition, and shall facilitate the development
of the general area.
For this purpose, the Commission shall exercise judgment as
warranted by the circumstances of each case to impose conditions
including but not limited to:
a. Grading and landscaping requirements.
b. Limitation on the months of the year, days of the week, and hours
of the day during which any work may be performed on the premises.

clearly essential to the construction or alteration of a building or
structure on the same premises, provided a (driveway, sewer, health,
wetland, zoning or building) permit has been issued for such
construction or alteration, and such work is specified in said permit.
2. Construction, grading or changing of contours in accordance with
plans for the same that have been approved by the Commission,
covering the roads, lots and other improvements in an approved
subdivision. Any excavation or filling beyond the limits shown in the
approved plan of the Commission's action shall require a permit as
outlined in this section.
3. The construction of a swimming pool or underground shelter for which a
Zoning Permit has been issued, or a wall, driveway, fence or other
special appurtenances to the use of land in question or the placement
of utility lines or services. Incidental filling, grading or
excavating in connection with maintenance, repairs, or minor
improvements to property or customary landscaping shall be exempt from

the issuance of the Limited Special Permit for Stockpiling, the
Commission may require the applicant to submit periodic reports showing
the location and size of stockpiles at stated periodic intervals.
3. Duration. A Limited Special Permit for Stockpiling may be revoked by
the Commission if it finds, after a hearing before the Commission, that
a condition or safeguard imposed by the Commission upon activities
authorized by such Permit has not been adhered to in all significant
respects and that, after notice from the Commission, the alleged
violation has not been corrected by the permittee. The permittee shall
be given a reasonable period of time in which to correct an alleged
violation prior to any hearing held

§6.14 LANDSCAPING, SCREENING, AND BUFFER AREAS
A. Purpose - The following standards are intended to enhance the appearance
and natural beauty of the Town and to protect property values through
preservation and planting of vegetation, screening, and landscaping
material. Specifically, these standards are intended to reduce excessive
heat, glare, and accumulation of dust; to provide privacy from noise and
visual intrusion; and to prevent the erosion of the soil, excessive run-off
of drainage water, and the consequent depletion of the ground water table
and the pollution of water bodies.
B. General requirements - The following provisions shall apply to any use in
all zoning districts:
l. Landscaping, trees, and plants required by these regulations shall be
planted in a growing condition according to accepted horticultural
practices, and they shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition.

features such as stone walls, shall be retained and protected. Existing
healthy, mature trees, if properly located, shall be fully credited
against the requirements of these regulations.
5. Where lot size and shape or existing structures make it infeasible to
comply with the requirements for a front landscaped area or landscaped
parking area, the Commission may approve planters, plant boxes or pots
containing trees, shrubs and/or flowers to comply with the intent of
these regulations.

requirements of §6.14.C.2 impractical.
b. The total area of the landscaping between the streetline and the
building is at least twice what would be achieved by §6.14.C.2
for that particular building.
c. No loading area shall be allowed in the area required by §6.14.C.2
if modified landscaping is allowed.

front of the building may be modified by the Commission to
eliminate the landscaping strip if the following requirements are
met: 10/02/94
a. A concrete sidewalk a minimum of four feet in width is built
abutting and parallel to the front of the building.
b. An area(s) of landscaping equivalent to twice the size of the

addition to the front landscaped strip (§6.l4.C.2).
D. Buffer area - The purpose of the buffer area is to provide privacy from
noise, headlight glare and visual intrusion to residential dwellings. A
buffer area shall be required along all boundaries of a non-residential lot
abutting any lot in a residential district.
Such buffer area shall comply with at least the following minimum
standards:
1. The buffer area shall be located within the boundaries of the subject
property within any non-residential district; however, the buffer area
may be located on abutting property in a residential district provided:

In cases where a less restrictive use is permitted to extend into a
more restrictive district, the minimum width of the buffer area shall
be determined by the Commission.
4. The buffer area shall be of evergreen planting of such type, height,
spacing and arrangement as, in the judgment of the Commission, will
199
effectively screen the activity on the lot from the neighboring
residential area. As a minimum, the planting shall consist of a double
row of trees six feet in height planted at intervals of 10 feet on
center. Non-evergreen planting may be included to supplement evergreen
planting, but not to take its place.
5. A landscaped earthen berm, wall, or fence of location, height, design,
and materials approved by the Commission may be accepted for any
portion of the required planting and/or buffer area.
6. Where the existing topography and/or landscaping provides adequate

buffer area requirements, parking areas shall comply with the following
minimum standards:
1. All uses required to provide 30 or more off-street parking spaces shall
have at least 10 square feet of interior landscaping within the paved

adjacent lots shall not exceed 24 feet in width and shall not exceed
two in number for each purpose. The landscaped area shall have a
minimum dimension of five feet, shall be planted with grass or shrubs
and shall include at least one tree of not less than two inch caliper

landscaped area shall be extended to the edge of the sidewalk.
3. Trees used in parking lots shall be Thornless Honey Locust, Pine, Oak,
or other similar fast-growing, hardy varieties, or existing trees where
appropriately located.

§7.5 SPECIAL PERMITS
A. Applicability.
1. A Special Permit shall be required for all uses specifically listed in
these regulations.
2. No Building Permit for any use requiring a Special Permit shall be
issued by the Building Official except after public notice and hearing
in accordance with General Statutes and upon authorization of the
Commission.
3. When the use of land or a building or structure existed prior to
the adoption of these regulations which is only allowed hereafter upon
approval as a Special Permit, such existing use shall be considered a
permitted use, provided the provisions of this section shall apply to
all proposed changes to such existing use.
4. Where two or more Special Permit uses apply to the same premises, the
minimum requirements shall be the minimum requirements for each use as
specified in these regulations, or in case of two or more Special
Permit uses in the same building, whichever requirements shall be more
restrictive.
B. Criteria for Evaluating a Special Permit: The Commission shall consider and
evaluate each and every application for a Special Permit by applying, at a
minimum, the following criteria: 03/15/97
1. Appropriateness of location or use:
a. The size and intensity of the proposed use or uses and its or their
effect on and compatibility with the adopted Plan of Development, the
specific zone and the neighborhood;
b. The existence of other uses of the same kind or character in the
neighborhood and the effect thereof on said neighborhood;
c. The capacity of adjacent streets to handle peak traffic loads and
hazards created by the use;
d. The obstruction of light or air, or the emission of noise, light,
smoke, odor, gas, dust or vibration in noxious or offensive
quantities, and the distance between offensive processes and adjacent
properties;
e. Unusual topography of the location, the nature, location, and height
of buildings, walls, stacks, fences, grades and landscaping of the
site;
f. The extent, nature and arrangement of parking facilities,
entrances and exits;
g. Problems of fire and police protection;
h. The preservation of the character of the neighborhood;
i. The availability of adequate sewerage and/or water supply;
k. All other standards prescribed by these Regulations.
2. Conformance: Conformance with the Wallingford Zoning Regulations
and, where applicable, the Wallingford Subdivision Regulations
and any applicable laws, codes or ordinances.
224
3. Safety, Health and Environment: Accessibility for emergency
vehicles and equipment; proper utility, drainage, driveways and
similar specifications; pedestrian access, mobility and safety; impact
on the environment shall be considered. 08/16/08
4. Overall Design, Architectural Treatment and Aesthetic Character:
The basic design of the proposed uses, buildings or development;
the relationship between the buildings and the land; the
relationships between uses and between buildings and structures;
the overall physical appearance of the proposed use, building or
development and its subsequent compatibility with surrounding
development and the neighborhood.
Findings as to design, architectural treatment and aesthetic
character shall be made in view of the fact that excessive
uniformity, dissimilarity, inappropriateness or poor quality of
design in the exterior appearance of buildings erected in any
neighborhood adversely affects the desirability of the immediate
area and the neighboring areas for residential, commercial or
other purposes, and, by so doing, impairs the benefits of
occupancy of existing property in such areas, the stability and
value of both improved and unimproved real property in the area,
prevents the most appropriate development and use of such areas,
produces degeneration of property with attendant deterioration of
conditions in the area affecting the health, general safety and
welfare of the community, and destroys a proper relationship
between the taxable values of real property in the area and the
cost of municipal services provided thereto.
5. In the case of a public utility structure, the public necessity
for the utility service provided and technical constraints
necessitating the location of the proposed facility within the
subject area.
C. Procedure - Application for a Special Permit shall be made to the
Commission and shall include: 10/18/03
1. A statement describing the existing and proposed use or uses.
2. A Special Permit plan, including the information contained in §7.4,
except as such information may be waived in accordance with §7.4.H.

compliance with the intent and purpose of this regulation.
D. Public Hearing and Notice: The Commission shall hold a hearing on all
applications for a Special Permit, and shall publish a notice of said
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in accordance with §10.2.A
herein and §8-3c of the Connecticut General Statutes. The Commission

b) A report from the Zoning Enforcement Officer attesting to
whether the above described sign was erected and maintained as
required shall be made part of the record at the public hearing.

of vandalism have destroyed a properly posted sign.
c) Each application for a Special Permit shall include a list,
prepared by the applicant, of the names and mailing addresses
of the owners of all of the properties abutting the applicant's

other pertinent reasons, a Conditional Certificate of Zoning
Compliance may be issued by the ZEO for a period not to exceed
six months. The applicant may be required to post a bond in
accordance with §8.10, to guarantee satisfactory completion of
the site work in accordance with these regulations.
§8.8 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
No land shall be used except for farming or gardening purposes, and no new

§8.9 FEES
All applications for Zoning Permits, Certificates of Zoning Compliance, Site
Plan Approvals and Special Permits shall be accompanied by a fee, in accordance
with an adopted fee schedule, as determined from time-to-time by the
Commission. Said fee shall be paid at the time of filing the application.
§8.10 PERFORMANCE BONDS
The Commission shall, if required by these regulations or deemed necessary by
the Commission, require a performance bond, in a form and amount acceptable to
231
the Commission, or its designated agents, to guarantee performance of the site
work as shown on the approved Site Plan. Such bond or surety may, at the
discretion of the person posting such bond or surety, be posted at any time
before all work of the site plan is complete, except that the Commission may
require a bond or surety for erosion control prior to the commencement of any
such work. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued before a required bond
or surety is posted. For any site plan that is approved for development in
phases, the surety provisions of this section shall apply as if each phase was

bond may be in the form of a check payable to the Town, an irrevocable
letter of credit from an acceptable bank, or a bond underwritten by a
surety company duly licensed and authorized to conduct business in the
State of Connecticut and approved by the Commission. Said bond shall be
posted with the Town in accordance with these regulations and with the
approval of the Commission. Unless released or extended by the Commission,
a bond shall be held until the applicable permit expires, at which time the
Commission may call the bond and use the proceeds to complete the bonded
work. . 03/13/04 03/14/09 10/15/11
B. If the person posting a bond or surety under this section requests a
release of all or a portion of such bond or surety, the Commission or
its agent shall, not later than sixty-five (65) days after receiving
such written request, (A) release any such bond or surety or portion
thereof, provided the Commission or its agent is reasonably satisfied
that the modifications for which such bond or surety or portion thereof
was posted have been complete, or (B) provide the person posting such
bond or surety with a written explanation as to the additional work
that must be completed before such bond or surety or portion thereof
may be released. 10/15/11
C. Upon written request of the applicant for the reduction or release of
the bond, the procedure shall be as follows: If for the reduction of
the bond, the site work shown to have been completed shall be inspected
by the Town Engineer or his designee to determine if all of the
conditions of approval for such work have been satisfied. If reduction
is authorized, the Commission may take into consideration the estimated
value of the work remaining to be completed, based on current
construction costs, in determining the amount, if any, of the
reduction. If for release of the bond, the site shall be inspected by
the Town Engineer or his designee to determine if all of the conditions
of approval have been satisfied and if all required site improvements
have been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved
plans. Before reduction or release of any performance bond, the
Commission may require the applicant to submit an As-Built map
certifying that all of the required site improvements for which the
reduction or release is sought have been constructed or installed in
accordance with the approved plans. Based on the results of the
inspections, the Commission may authorize the reduction or release of
the bond or surety.
232

ARTICLE IX
Zoning Board of Appeals
§9.1 ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
A. Purpose - The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is an agency, separate
from the Planning and Zoning Commission, engaged in, and necessary
to the proper administration of these Zoning Regulations. The ZBA is
an administrative agency which exercises quasi-judicial functions to
provide relief in cases where literal application of the Zoning
Regulations acts peculiarly on a particular piece of property to
produce an undue hardship on that property under special
circumstances and to provide a local review for questions arising
from zoning enforcement. The exercise of the ZBA's power to vary
the Zoning Regulations is guided by the General Statutes and the
general rule of law as well as by local zoning conditions.
B. Establishment of the ZBA - The ZBA, established pursuant to the
General Statutes and Town Charter, shall have all the powers and
duties prescribed by law and these regulations.
C. Power and Duties - The ZBA shall have the following powers and
duties:
.
1. Appeals - To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that
there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by
the ZEO or any other official charged with the enforcement of
these regulations excluding decisions of the Commission pursuant to
Articles III, IV, V, VI, VII of the Zoning Regulations and the
Subdivision Regulations, unless such decision is a determination of a
zoning violation. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days of
the decision appealed from. 03/15/02
2. Other Matters - To hear and decide all matters, including
Special Exceptions, upon which it is required to pass by the
specific terms of these regulations.
3. Variances - To determine and vary the application or provisions
of these regulations in harmony with their general purpose and
intent and with due consideration for conserving the public
health, safety, convenience, welfare and property values solely
with respect to a parcel of land where, owing to conditions
especially affecting such parcel but not affecting generally the
district in which it is situated, a literal enforcement of these
regulations would result in exceptional difficulty or unusual
hardship, so that substantial justice will be done and the
public safety and welfare secured. Financial detriment shall not
be considered an unnecessary hardship.
4. Location of Uses - Deleted 09/17/05
D. Rules and Procedure - The ZBA shall adopt such rules, regulations
and procedures as may be deemed necessary to carry into effect the
provisions of these regulations.
E. Public Hearing Conducted by ZBA - Notice of public hearings on
Variances, Special Exceptions and Appeals: 09/17/05
234
1. The ZBA shall hold a public hearing on all applications. The ZBA
shall conduct the proceedings in conformance with the Connecticut
General Statutes. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such
hearings shall be published in a newspaper having substantial
circulation within the Town at least twice at intervals of not less
than two days, the first not more than 15 days nor less than 10 days
and the last not less than 2 days before the hearing by the ZBA. The
ZBA shall hold all public hearings within 65 days after the date of
receipt of an application. 10/02/94
2. Where an applicant's property is within 500 feet of a municipal
boundary, the municipal clerk of said adjoining municipality shall be
notified of the hearing by certified mail within one week after the
application is received. 10/01/03
3. Each application to the ZBA shall include a list, prepared by
the applicant, of the names and mailing addresses of the owners
of all abutting property, as shown on the most recent records on
file in the Tax Assessor's Office (or the actual owners of
record if otherwise known to the applicant). The applicant shall
mail notification of said pending application to at least one
owner of each such property 10) to 150 days before the date 07/14/01
before the date set for the public hearing, by transmitting the text of
the public hearing notice as provided by the ZBA.
4. Evidence of such mailing, in the form of United States Post Office
Certificates of Mailing, shall be submitted to the agent of the ZBA
along with the above said list of property owners, not less than 5
calendar days prior to the hearing date. Failure to comply with any of
the procedures required herein shall be deemed valid basis for denial
of an application.
F. Decisions of ZBA - In granting an application, the ZBA may prescribe
any conditions applying thereto that it may deem necessary or
desirable. Decisions of the ZBA shall be made in accordance with the
purpose and spirit of these regulations.
G. Deleted 09/17/05
H. Variances, where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape, topographical or unusual condition of a specific property,
and not common to the surrounding area as a whole, and where the
strict application of the requirements or limitations of any district
would result in peculiar and undue hardship upon the use of the property,
as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or convenience, the
regulations may be varied.
l. No variance shall be granted on any allegation of hardship
resulting from an act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption
of this regulation, whether in violation of the provisions hereof
or not. Before granting a variance on the basis of unusual
difficulty or unreasonable hardship, the ZBA shall consider the
following conditions:
a. That if the owner complies with the provisions of these regulations,
he would not be able to make any reasonable use of his property.
b. That the difficulties or hardship are peculiar to the property
in question, in contrast with those of other properties in the
same district.
c. That the hardship was not the result of the applicant's own action.
235
d. That the hardship is not merely financial or pecuniary.
e. Every application for a use variance filed with the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall at the same time be filed by the applicant with the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The applicant shall certify to the
Zoning Board of Appeals that such application was filed with the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may file a report with the Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the
application. The failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to
file a report with the Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the
application shall not be taken as agreement with such application.
03/20/90
2. Survey Requirements – When an application is submitted for a variance
of required yard setbacks, maximum building coverage, or other similar
regulations, and a Zoning Location Survey will be required by §8.3 for
the proposed project, said survey shall be submitted at the time of
application for the variance. No variance will be granted for which a
required Zoning Location Survey has not been submitted. 09/19/09
I. Interpretation - Upon appeal from a decision of the ZEO and subject to
appropriate conditions and safeguards, the ZBA may interpret or
determine the following:
1. The true location of any district boundary line.
2. The existence of a non-conforming use.
3. Any other interpretation by the ZEO.
J. Special Exceptions - To hear and decide requests for Special
Exceptions where required by the specific terms of these
Regulations. Each specific Special Exception for which a permit is
sought shall be considered as an individual case and shall, in
addition to other standards prescribed in these regulations, conform
to the detailed application of the following standards in a manner
appropriate to the particular circumstances of such use:
1. The nature, location, size, intensity and site layout of the use
shall be such that it will be in harmony with the appropriate
and orderly development of the area in which it is situated.
2. The nature and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its
site layout, and its relation to streets giving access to it shall be
such that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use and
the assembly of persons in connection with it, shall not be hazardous
or inconvenient to the predominant character of the neighborhood, or
conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood, taking into
consideration, among other things, convenient routes of pedestrian
traffic, particularly street intersections, vehicular turning movements
in relation to routes and volumes of traffic flow, sight distances, and
adequacy of parking facilities.
3. The location and height of buildings and structures, the location,
nature and height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use shall not hinder or
discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent lands and
buildings or impair the value thereof.
4. The ZBA may require that permits for Special Exceptions be periodically
renewed with a time period prescribed by the ZBA. Any approval shall
commence within one year, unless the Board grants an extension of time.
236
K. Time of Decision - The ZBA shall render its decision on such an application
within the time limits established by §8.7(d) of the Connecticut General
Statutes. 10/01/03

hazard area shall be given written notice that the structure will be
permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base
flood
elevation (BFE), and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.

I. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Purpose:
It is the intent of these regulations that all land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it
can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety, that proper
provision shall be made for water, drainage and sewerage and, in areas contiguous to brooks,
rivers, or other bodies of water subject to flooding, that proper provision shall be made for
protective flood control measures, that the proposed streets are in harmony with existing or
proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the Plan of Development, especially in regard to safe
intersections with such thoroughfares, and so arranged and of such width as to provide an
adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs. These regulations
also provide that the Commission may require the provision of open spaces, parks and
playgrounds when, and in places deemed proper by the Commission, which open spaces, parks
and playgrounds shall be shown on the subdivision plan. These regulations also provide that
proper provision be made for soil erosion and sediment control and solar access (From
Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25).
B. Waiver of Requirements:
The Commission, upon written request from the applicant, may waive specific requirements of
these regulations by a ¾ vote of all Commission members with respect to a subdivision where,
owing to physical site conditions especially affecting such subdivision, a literal application of
these regulations would result in undesirable development, practical difficulty or unusual
hardship, so that substantial justice will be done. No waiver shall be granted that would conflict
with the Zoning Regulations, or any other Town, State or Federal regulation, or that would have
a significant adverse effect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. In granting a
waiver of specific requirements of these regulations, the Commission shall state the reasons for
its action and may attach such conditions that it deems necessary to preserve the purpose and
intent of these regulations.
C. Subdivision Modifications:
Applications for subdivision modifications which are necessitated by site conditions, or which are
deemed to be in the public interest, shall be made in the same manner as the original
application; except that modifications which are found to be of minor nature or which do not
materially alter the subdivision, may be authorized by the Town Planner with the concurrence of
the Town Engineer, where appropriate, or by the Legal Traffic Authority, as it pertains to traffic
and public safety.
D. Approval:
The Commission shall not approve any subdivision plan unless it conforms to the standards
hereinafter specified and to the Wallingford Zoning Regulations.
E. Penalties for Violations:
Any person, firm, or corporation making any subdivision of land without the approval of the
Commission shall be subject to penalties in accordance with the General Statutes.

drinking water for the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will
increase as the population grows and opportunities for new surface
water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and increasingly
intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells
have been contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are
now threatened. To address this problem, Connecticut has established
the Aquifer Protection Area Program (Connecticut General Statutes §22a-
354a to §22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply aquifers and to
protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires
coordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and
water companies to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water
for present and future generations. It is therefore the purpose of
these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the Town of
Wallingford by making provisions for:
1) implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An
Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General
Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb (“the Act”);
2) delineating aquifer protection areas on the Zoning Map of the Town
of Wallingford
3) regulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area
including: prohibiting certain new activities; registering
existing regulated activities; and issuing permits for new
regulated activities at registered facilities, and;
4) administering and enforcing these regulations.
b) These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Areas
Regulations (the “APA Regulations”) of the Town of Wallingford.
c) These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time,
in accordance with the provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning
Aquifer Protection Areas, the Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to
§22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies§22a-354i-1
through §22a-354i-10.
d) The Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Wallingford is
established as the Aquifer Protection Agency in accordance with the
Aquifer Protection Agency Ordinance (the “APA Ordinance”) effective
May 29, 2004, and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the
APA Ordinance and the Act.
- 2 -
e) The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or
deny registrations, issue permits, issue permits with terms,
conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all
regulated activities in aquifer protection areas in the Town of
Wallingford pursuant to the Act.
f) In order to carry out the purposes of the APA Regulations, the Town of
Wallingford may at any time purchase land or an interest in land in fee
simple or other acceptable title, or subject to acceptable restrictions
or exceptions, and enter into covenants and agreements with landowners.

application fee if the Agency determines that:
1) the activity applied for would clearly result in a substantial
public benefit to the environment or to the public health and
safety and the registrant or applicant would reasonably be
deterred from initiating the activity solely or primarily as a
result of the amount of the registration or permit application
fee; or

clearly excessive in relation to the cost to the Town for
reviewing and processing the registration or permit application.

outside consultants, experts, or legal advisors are incurred in
processing the registration or permit application the registrant or
applicant may be assessed an additional fee not to exceed $10,000.00 to
cover said costs. Said fees are to be estimated by the duly authorized
agent and submitted with the registration or permit application fee and
held until the registration or permit application is completely processed
after which time any residual funds pertaining to this assessment are to
be returned to the registrant or applicant.

professional who is not an employee of the Town of Wallingford
