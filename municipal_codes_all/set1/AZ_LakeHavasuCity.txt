   A.   Issuance.



      1.   When the Code Official determines that a violation

pursuant to § 1.12.030, the applicable Code Official may issue a notice of
civil violation to the person responsible for the violation.

§ 1.12.050  ABATEMENT.



   A.   Notice to abate.



      1.   In addition to or in lieu of filing a civil citation or
criminal complaint, the city may serve a notice to abate any violation of
this code.



      2.   The notice to abate shall contain the following
information:



         a.   A detailed description of the conditions
constituting the violations along with legal citations of applicable code,
statutory, or regulatory provisions.



         b.   The period of time, not less than 30 calendar days
from the service of the notice to abate, in which the person responsible for
the violation must abate or correct the violation.



         c.   Identification of the property in violation by
legal description and street address, if known, and if unknown, then by book,
map, and parcel number.



         d.   Re-inspection date, if any.



         e.   Name, business address, and business phone number
of the Code Official who issued the notice.



         f.   A warning statement that if the violations are not
corrected within the period stated, the city may abate the nuisance itself or
by private contractor, assess the owner for the cost of such abatement, and
record a lien on the property for the assessment.



      3.   Prior to the date set for compliance on the notice to
abate, the person responsible for the violation may appeal in writing to the
Council. The Council shall, at its next regular meeting no less than 7
calendar days after receiving the appeal, hear the appeal and issue a
decision of the Council, which shall be final. The Council may either affirm
or reverse the notice or may modify the scope of the work required under the
notice to abate. The 30 days given to perform the work shall be stayed during
the time from the date the appeal is received by the City Clerk until written
notice of the Council’s decision is served in the same manner upon the
person responsible for the violation as set forth in § 1.12.050H. The
Council may grant an extension of time for compliance at the time of its
disposition of the appeal.



      4.   Nothing in this section shall require the issuance of
notice of violation prior to commencement of other enforcement proceedings,
including civil or criminal proceedings.



   B.   Summary abatement. Whenever any violation of the code causes a
condition constituting an immediate and emergent threat to the public’s
health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the city may summarily and
without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of abatement, including the
reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as
soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. For violations of Title 12:
Buildings and Construction, all notices, if any, required under Title 12:
Buildings and Construction shall be given in accordance with such provision
before the city may summarily abate a violation.



   C.   Court ordered abatement.



      1.   In addition to any other abatement procedure provided in
this chapter, the City Manager or designee, or the City Attorney’s Office,
may apply to the Municipal Court for an order permitting the city to abate
any condition that constitutes a violation of this code.



      2.   After notice to the person responsible for the violation,
the judge or court hearing officer shall conduct a hearing. The hearing shall
be informal and open to the public. Evidence may be taken from any interested
party and considered in determining whether a condition in violation of the
public nuisance ordinance exists and what, if any, abatement action should be
permitted. Any person who fails to appear after notice of the hearing may be
deemed to have waived any right to introduce evidence. The court’s
determination shall be based on the preponderance of evidence.



   D.   Upon finding that abatement is appropriate, the court may order
demolition, board-up, clean-up or any other action the court deems reasonably
necessary to correct the violation.



   E.   Statement of account.



      1.   When the city has undertaken action to abate a violation,
the City Manager or designee shall prepare a verified statement of the actual
costs of abatement, including associated legal, inspection, and other
incidental connected costs. That statement shall further set forth the
following:



         a.   The street address and legal description of the
property.



         b.   Reference to attachment of the notice to abate and
order to abate and applicable invoices, contracts, or other documentation of
the work done.



         c.   The date the work was completed.



         d.   A summary and total of the costs of abatement.



         e.   That the statement of account is an assessment upon
the lots and tracts of land from which the city corrected or abated the
violation.



         f.   That the party has 15 calendar days from the date
of service to pay the total cost of abatement.



         g.   In the event payment is not received in 15 calendar
days, the city will place a lien on the property in the amount of the
assessment.



         h.   The right and procedures for appeals of statement
of account.



      2.   The statement of account shall be served in the same
manner as prescribed in § 1.12.050H.



      3.   The statement of account is subject to the same appeal
process as outlined in § 1.12.050A.3. If no written and timely request for
hearing is made under this section, then the statement of account is final
and binding. The city is authorized to record an assessment in the amount
specified in the statement of account with the Mohave County Recorder’s
Office.



      4.   From the date of recording, the assessment shall be a
lien on the property and shall bear interest at the legal rate until paid.
The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all
matters recited therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to
recording thereof.



      5.   An assessment under this section shall not be a bar to
subsequent assessments hereunder and any number of liens on the same property
may be enforced in a single action.



      6.   The city may bring an action to enforce the lien in the
superior court at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure
to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity.



   F.   Recording of violation or lien of assessment. The notice to
abate and statement of account and any assessment lien recorded by the city
shall run with the land. The city, at its sole discretion, may record a
notice to abate, order to abate, and a statement of account with the Mohave
County Recorder and thereby cause compliance by an entity thereafter
acquiring such property. When the property is brought into compliance, a
satisfaction of notice to abate shall be recorded with the Mohave County
Recorder. When an assessment lien is paid off, a satisfaction of the lien
shall be recorded.



   G.   Appeal of court decision. Any party may appeal the judgment of
the court to the superior court. Appeals from civil proceedings shall be in
accordance with the Superior Court Rule of Appellate Procedure—Civil.
Execution of any judgment shall be stayed pending appeal.



   H.   The notice to abate and the statement of account shall be
served per the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure to the person responsible for
the violation. Service is deemed effective and complete on the date it is
received by the person responsible for the violation.

address the last tax bill for the property was mailed. Notice must be given
at least 30 days prior to the day set for compliance and must include the
legal description of the property and the cost of the removal by the city if
the owner, occupant, or lessee does not comply. The notice may be recorded in
the County Recorder’s Office, and if satisfied, the city must record a
release of the notice.



      2.   Prior to the date set for compliance on the notice, the
owner, occupant, or lessee of the property may appeal in writing to the
Council unless the removal or abatement is ordered by a court. The Council
shall, at its next regular meeting no less than 7 calendar days after
receiving the appeal, hear the appeal and issue a decision of the Council,
which shall be final. The Council may either affirm or reverse the notice or
may modify the scope of the work required pursuant to the notice. The 30 days
given to perform the work shall be stayed during the time from the date the
appeal is received by the City Clerk until written notice of the Council’s
decision is provided, as set forth in § 1.12.055A.1., upon the owner,
occupant, or lessee. The Council may grant an extension of time for
compliance at the time of its disposition of the appeal.



      3.   That any person that recklessly places or causes to be
placed any rubbish, trash, filth or debris on any property not owned or under
the control of that person:



         a.   Is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor or a civil
violation unless that person immediately removes or causes to be removed the
rubbish, trash, filth or debris from that property. One hundred percent of
any assessed fine or civil penalty shall be deposited in the general fund of
the city. At least 50% of the fine or civil penalty shall be used by the city
for the purposes of illegal dumping cleanup.



         b.   In addition to any fine or penalty imposed for a
violation of this section, the person is liable for all costs that may be
assessed pursuant to this section for removing, abating or enjoining the
rubbish, trash, filth or debris and for all costs incurred by the owner,
lessee, occupant or lienholder of the property in the removal and disposal of
the rubbish, trash, filth or debris.



         c.   If required to remove any rubbish, trash, filth or
debris pursuant to this section, the person must provide the city a receipt
from a disposal facility or other documentation evidencing lawful disposal of
the rubbish, trash, filth or debris.



   B.   In the event that any person with interest in the property
fails to remove the rubbish, trash, weeds, filth, debris, or dilapidated
structures and abate the condition which constitutes a hazard to public
health and safety, after notice as provided herein has been given, the city
may, at the expense of the owner, occupant, or lessee, remove, abate, enjoin,
or cause the removal thereof.



   C.   The cost of removal, abatement, or injunction of the rubbish,
trash, weeds, filth, debris or dilapidated builds from any property, and
associated legal, inspection, and other incidental connected costs, shall be
assessed on the property and may be recorded in the Mohave County
Recorder’s Office.  Service of the assessment shall be in manner
prescribed in § 1.12.055A.1. and appeal of the assessment shall be in the
manner prescribed in § 1.12.055A.2.



   D.   Assessments run against the property until paid. A prior
assessment for the purposes provided in this section shall not be a bar to
subsequent assessments, and any number of assessments on the same property
may be enforced in the same action.

§ 2.04.270  CONSENT AGENDA.

nature, and it is desirable to expedite the public business and provide
additional time for deliberation of non-routine matters, a consent agenda may
be utilized as follows:



      1.   When any item of business requires action by the Council,
but is of a routine and noncontroversial nature, the item may be presented at
a regular meeting of the Council as part of a consent agenda.



      2.   The consent agenda shall be introduced by a motion "to
approve the consent agenda," and shall be considered by the Council as a
single item.



      3.   There shall be no debate or discussion by any member of
the Council regarding any item on the consent agenda beyond asking questions
for simple clarification.



      4.   All items on the consent agenda which require public
hearings shall be open for hearing simultaneously, and the Mayor shall
announce, or direct the City Clerk to announce, the titles of all such items.



      5.   Upon objection by any member of the Council to inclusion
of any item on the consent agenda, that item shall be removed from the
consent agenda forthwith. Objections may be recorded at any time prior to the
taking of a vote on the motion to approve the consent agenda. All such items
shall be considered individually, in the order in which they were objected
to, immediately following consideration of the consent agenda.



      6.   Approval of the motion to approve the consent agenda
shall be fully equivalent to approval, adoption or enactment of each motion,
resolution, ordinance or other item of business thereon, exactly as if each
had been acted upon individually.



(Ord. 11-1030, passed 4-12-2011)



§ 2.04.280  COUNCIL REQUESTS.

Mayor will work with the Councilmember(s) and the City Manager to determine
the best course of action for handling the request.

and not to any individual member thereof.

   Interested parties or their authorized representatives may request that
an item be placed on the City Council meeting agenda by submitting a written
request to the City Clerk or the City Council as a whole. The City Manager or
designee will research the request to determine if it can be handled
administratively or requires City Council action. If determined that the
matter should be placed before the City Council, the City Manager will ensure
that documentation, if any, is compiled and any necessary material forwarded
to the City Clerk in the same manner as other items are presented to the City
Council, and the City Clerk shall place the item on the next available
regular meeting agenda. If the City Manager determines that the matter is not
appropriate to be placed on the Council agenda, the City Clerk shall notify
the citizen that their request will not be placed on the agenda and provided
any additional information, as applicable. Only the party or authorized
representatives making the request may present the item to the City Council,
unless permitted otherwise by the City Council. All questions directed to the
City Council must be made through the Chairperson. The presentation of the
item at the City Council meeting shall be limited to 10 minutes unless
additional time is granted.

understanding for a budget year.



   K.   If there is a claim of breach of a memorandum of understanding
and the employee organization's existing memorandum of understanding does not
provide a process for resolution of the breach, the breach process in
division L shall apply. If the matter is submitted for resolution to the
Mayor and City Council either through the breach process established in
division L or a breach process established in a memorandum of understanding,
the decision of the Mayor and City Council shall be final and binding upon
the parties and employees.

provided that:



   (1)   The amount deducted for the bad debt must be deducted from
gross income of the month in which the actual charge-off was made, and only
to the extent that such amount was actually charged-off, and also only to the
extent that such amount is or was included as taxable gross income; and



   (2)   If any amount is subsequently collected on such charged-off

as payment, not to exceed the full sales price for any tangible personal
property sold, when the full sales price is included in taxable gross

amount was reported as taxable gross income in that prior reporting period.



Sec. 3.02-250.  Exclusion of combined taxes from gross income; itemization;
notice; limitations.



(a)   When tax is separately charged and/or collected.  The total amount
of gross income shall be exclusive of combined taxes only when the person
upon whom the tax is imposed shall establish to the satisfaction of the Tax
Collector that such tax has been added to the total price of the
transaction.  The taxpayer must provide to his customer and also keep a
reliable record of the actual tax charged or collected, shown by cash
register tapes, sales tickets, or other accurate record, separating net
transaction price and combined tax.  If at any time the Tax Collector cannot
ascertain from the records kept by the taxpayer the total or amounts billed
or collected on account of combined taxes, the claimed taxes collected may
not be excluded from gross income, unless such records are completed and/or
clarified to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector.



   (1)   Remittance of all tax charged and/or collected.  When an
added charge is made to cover City (or combined) Privilege and Use Taxes, the
person upon whom the tax is imposed shall pay the full amount of the City
taxes due, whether collected by him or not, and in the event he collects more
than the amount due he shall remit the excess to the Tax Collector.  In the
event the Tax Collector cannot ascertain from the records kept by the
taxpayer the total or amounts of taxes collected by him, and the Tax
Collector is satisfied that the taxpayer has collected taxes in an amount in
excess of the tax assessed under this Chapter, the Tax Collector may
determine the amount collected and collect the tax so determined in the
manner provided in this Chapter.

from his gross income any amounts paid to him by customers for combined taxes
passed on to the customer, must prove that he has provided his customer with
a written record of the transaction showing at a minimum the price before the
tax, the combined taxes, and the total cost.  This shall be addition to the
record required to be kept under subsection (a) above.



(b)   When tax has been neither separately charged nor separately
collected.  When the person upon whom the tax is imposed shall establish by
means of invoices, sales tickets, or other reliable evidence, that no added
charge was made to cover combined taxes, the taxpayer may exclude tax
collected from such income by dividing such taxable gross income by 1.00 plus
a decimal figure representing the effective combined tax rate expressed as a
fraction of 1.00.



Sec. 3.02-260.  Exclusion of fees and taxes from gross income; limitations.

         (B)   Evidence which would establish the applicability

whom the tax would otherwise be imposed from liability therein, if he acts in
good faith as provided by Regulation.

indicate both individual transaction amounts and totals for each reporting
period for each category of taxable, exempt, and excluded income defined by

      (8)   Payments of tax to the Arizona Department of
Transportation and computations therefor, when a motor-vehicle transporter
claims such the exemption.

Occupancy imposed by Section 3.04-440.



   (f)   Any additional documentation as the Tax Collector, by

of the specialized business activity of specific exemptions afforded to that
class of taxpayer.

(Ord. 15-1132, passed 5-26-2015)



Sec. 3.03-370.  Recordkeeping:  claim of exclusion, exemption, deduction,
or credit; documentation; liability.



(a)   All deductions, exclusions, exemptions and credits provided in this
Chapter are conditional upon adequate proof and documentation of such as may
be required either by this Chapter or Regulation.



(b)   Any person who claims and receives an exemption, deduction,
exclusion, or credit to which he is not entitled under this Chapter, shall be
subject to, liable for, and pay the tax on the transaction as if the vendor
subject to the tax had passed the burden of the payment of the tax to the
person wrongfully claiming the exemption.  A person who wrongfully claimed
such exemption shall be treated as if he is delinquent in the payment of the
tax and shall be subject to interest and penalties upon such delinquency. 
However, if the tax is collected from the vendor on such transaction it shall
not again be collected from the person claiming the exemption, or if
collected from the person claiming the exemption it shall not also be
collected from the vendor.



(Ord. 15-1132, passed 5-26-2015)



Sec. 3.03-372.  Proof of exemption:  sale for resale; sale, rental, lease,
or license of rental equipment.



A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for
rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to
persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being
acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course
of business. The fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License
number, and makes a verbal claim of “sale for resale or lease” or
“lease for re-lease” does not meet this burden and is insufficient to
justify an exemption. The “reasonable evidence” must be evidence which
exists objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the
property being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the
acquiring person in the ordinary course of business. Failure to obtain such
reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for
disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions.



(Ord. 15-1132, passed 5-26-2015)



Sec. 3.03-380.  Inadequate or unsuitable records.

Collector to be inadequate or unsuitable to determine the amount of the tax
for which such taxpayer is liable under the provisions of this Chapter, it is
the responsibility of the taxpayer either:



   (a)   To provide such other records required by this Chapter or
Regulation; or



   (b)   To correct or to reconstruct his records, to the satisfaction
of the Tax Collector.

activity or transaction subject to the tax.

(a)   The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer, with or without a formal
written request from a taxpayer, may issue a taxpayer assistance order that

Collector; abatement of penalties and interest; definition.  (Local audits)



(a)   Notwithstanding Section 3.05-540(a), no interest or penalty may be
assessed on an amount assessed as a deficiency if either:



   (1)   The deficiency assessed is directly attributable to erroneous
written advice furnished to the taxpayer by an employee of the City acting in
an official capacity in response to a specific request from the taxpayer and
not from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information.



   (2)   All of the following are true:



      (A)   A tax return form prepared by the Tax Collector contains
a statement that, if followed by a taxpayer, would cause the taxpayer to
misapply this Chapter.

      (C)   The taxpayer's underpayment directly results from this
reliance.

(a)   Unless expressly authorized by law, the Tax Collector shall not
apply any newly enacted legislation retroactively or in a manner that will
penalize a taxpayer for complying with prior law.



(b)   If the Tax Collector adopts a new interpretation or application of
any provision of this Chapter or determines that any provision applies to a
new or additional category or type of business and the change in
interpretation or application is not due to a change in the law:



      (1)   The change in interpretation or application applies
prospectively only unless it is favorable to taxpayers.



      (2)   The Tax Collector shall not assess any tax, penalty or

that the Tax Collector's estimate is not reasonable and correct, by providing
sufficient documentation of the type and form required by this Chapter or
satisfactory to the Tax Collector.

Sec. 3.05-546.  Closing agreements in cases of extensive taxpayer
misunderstanding or misapplication; approval; rules.  (Local Audits)



(a)   If the Tax Collector determines that noncompliance with tax
obligations results from extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of
provisions of this Chapter it may enter into closing agreements with those
taxpayers under the following terms and conditions:



   (1)   Extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws
occurs if the Tax Collector determines that more than sixty percent (60%) of
the persons in the affected class have failed to properly account for their
taxes owing to the same misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws.



   (2)   The Tax Collector shall publicly declare the nature of the
possible misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected
taxpayers and shall conduct a public hearing to hear testimony regarding the
extent of the misapplication and the definition of the affected class.



   (3)   If, after the public hearing, the Tax Collector determines
that a class of affected taxpayers has failed to comply with their tax
obligations because of extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the
tax laws it shall issue a tax ruling announcing that finding and publish the
ruling in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and through the next
two model city tax code updates.



   (4)   A closing agreement under this Section may abate some or all
of the penalties, interest and tax that taxpayers have failed to remit, or
the agreement may provide for the prospective treatment of the matter as to
the class of affected taxpayers.  All taxpayers in the class shall be
offered the opportunity to enter into a similar agreement for the same tax
periods.



   (5)   Taxpayers in the affected class who have properly accounted
for their tax obligations for these tax periods shall be offered the
opportunity to enter into an equivalent closing agreement providing for a pro
rata credit or refund of their taxes previously paid.



   (6)   The closing agreement shall require the taxpayers to properly
account for and pay such taxes in the future.  If a taxpayer fails to adhere
to such a requirement, the closing agreement is voidable by the Tax Collector
and he may assess the taxpayer for the delinquent taxes.  The Tax Collector
may issue such a proposed assessment within six months after the date that he
declares that closing agreement void or within the period prescribed by
Section 3.05-550 of this Chapter.



(b)   Before entering into closing agreements pursuant to this Section,
the Tax Collector shall secure such approval as required by charter,
ordinance or administrative regulation.



(c)   After a closing agreement has been signed pursuant to this Section,
it is final and conclusive except on a showing of fraud, malfeasance or
misrepresentation of a material fact.  The case shall not be reopened as to
the matters agreed upon or the agreement shall not be modified by any
officer, employee or agent of the City.  The agreement or any determination,
assessment, collection, payment abatement, refund or credit made pursuant to
the agreement shall not be annulled, modified, set aside or disregarded in
any suit, action or proceeding.



(d)   The Tax Collector shall report in writing its activities under this
Section to the Mayor and City Council on or before February 1 of each year.

A.R.S.  Section 42-1108.

(d)   Special provisions relating to owner-builders.  The limitation for
an owner-builder subject to the tax as prescribed in Section 3.04-417  shall

provided in Section 3.04-417.

(e)   The fact that the taxpayer has not maintained or provided such books
and records which the Tax Collector considers necessary to determine the tax
liability of any person does not preclude the Tax Collector from making any
assessment.  In such cases, the Tax Collector is authorized to use
estimates, projections, or samplings, to determine the correct tax.  The
provisions of Section 3.05-545(b), concerning estimates, shall apply.

the initial examination, falsified books or records, or otherwise engaged in
conduct which prevented the Tax Collector from conducting an accurate

right to proceed thereunder, may be raised and contested by the taxpayer in a
subsequent administrative review brought pursuant to Section 3.05-570.



(b)   An audit or examination conducted by any other taxing jurisdiction

   (4)   After issuing the notice of determination of deficiency but
before the deficiency became final, the Arizona Tax Court, Court of Appeals

assessment, but any such informal conference is not required for the taxpayer
to file a petition for administrative review.



(b)   Administrative Review.



   (1)   Filing a Petition.  Other than in the case of a jeopardy
assessment, a taxpayer may contest the applicability or amount of tax,
penalty, or interest imposed upon or paid by him pursuant to this Chapter by
filing a petition for a hearing or for redetermination with the Tax Collector
as set forth below:



      (A)   Within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the taxpayer
of notice of a determination by the Tax Collector that a tax, penalty, or
interest amount is due, or that a request for refund or credit has been
denied; or



      (B)   By voluntary payment of any contested amount when
accompanied by a timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of
the protested portion of said payment; or



      (C)   By petition accompanying a timely filed return
contesting an amount reported but not paid; or



      (D)   By petition requesting review of denial of waiver of
penalty as provided in subsection 3.05-540(g).



   (2)   Extension to file a petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may
request an extension from the Tax Collector. Such request must be in writing,
state the reasons for the requested delay and must be filed with the Tax
Collector within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition.
The Tax Collector shall allow a forty-five (45) day extension to file a
petition, when such written request has been properly and timely made by the
taxpayer. The Tax Collector may grant an additional extension and may
determine the corresponding time of any such extension at his sole discretion.



   (3)   Requirements for petition.



      (A)   The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the
reasons why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the
amount of reduction or refund requested.  The petition may be amended at any
time prior to the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such
time as the Hearing Officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of
redeterminations without hearings.  The Hearing Officer may require that
amendments be in writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable
period of time to file the amendment.  The Hearing Officer shall provide a
reasonable period of time for the Tax Collector to review and respond to the
petition and to any written amendments.



      (B)   The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a
hearing which shall be granted by the Hearing Officer.  If no request for
hearing is made the petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision
by the Hearing Officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any
reply made by the Tax Collector.



      (C)   The provisions of this Section are exclusive, and no
petition seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered
unless the petition is timely and properly filed under the Section.



   (4)   Transmittal to Hearing Officer. The city shall designate a
Hearing Officer, who may be other than an employee of the City. The Tax
Collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to
the Municipal Tax Hearing Office (MTHO) within twenty (20) days after
receipt, accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the
Hearing Officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper
form, he shall notify both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector; and in cases
of petitions not in proper form only, the Hearing Officer shall provide the
taxpayer with an extension up to forty-five (45) days to correct the petition.



   (5)   Hearings shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer and shall be
continuous until the Hearing Officer closes the record.  The taxpayer may be
heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. 
Hearings shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and
presentation of evidence.  The Hearing Officer shall admit evidence over
hearsay objections where the offered evidence has substantial probative value
and reliability.  Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the
ordinary course of business may be admitted, without objection as to
foundation, but subject to argument as to weight, admissibility, and
authenticity.  Summary accounting records may be admitted subject to
satisfactory proof of the reliability of the summaries.  In all cases, the
decision of the Hearing Officer shall be made solely upon substantial and
reliable evidence.  All expenses incurred in the hearing shall be paid by
the party incurring the same.



   (6)   Redeterminations upon a "petition for redetermination" shall
follow the same conditions, except that no oral hearing shall be held.



   (7)   Hearing Ruling.  In either case, the Hearing Officer shall
issue his ruling not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the
record by the Hearing Officer.



   (8)   Notice of Refund or Adjusted Assessment.  Within sixty (60)
days of the issuance of the Hearing Officer's decision, the Tax Collector
shall issue to the taxpayer either a notice of refund or an adjusted
assessment recalculated to conform to the Hearing Officer's decision.



(c)   Stipulations that future tax is also protested.  A taxpayer may
enter into a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar
nature are also at issue in any protest or appeal.  However, unless such
stipulation is made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely
and exclusively with the tax specifically protested and no other.  When a
taxpayer enters into such a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future
taxes of similar nature will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or
court case, it is the burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and
keep record of such income or protested taxable amount in his books and
records in the same manner as the taxpayer is required to segregate exempt
income.



(d)   When an assessment is final.



   (1)   If a request for administrative review and petition for
hearing or redetermination of an assessment made by the Tax Collector is not
filed within the period required by subsection (b) above, such person shall
be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount
determined to be due and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due
shall be final as provided in subsections 3.05-545(a) and 3.05-555(f).



   (2)   The decision made by the Hearing Officer upon administrative
review by hearing or redetermination shall become final thirty (30) days
after the taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment
required by subsection (b)(8) above, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or
decision in the manner provided in Section 3.05-575.



(e)   The provisions of the State taxpayer bill of rights (A.R.S. Section
42-2051 et. seq.) shall not apply.

Sec. 3.05-571.  Jeopardy assessments.  (State Administration and Audits)



(a)   If the Tax Collector believes that collection of any amounts imposed
by this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall issue notice to the
taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111.



(b)   In cases where such jeopardy notice has been issued, the taxpayer
must meet the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111, concerning appeals of
jeopardy assessments, before any request for administrative review shall be
honored.  Any bond or collateral that may be required shall meet the
provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1102.



(c)   (Reserved)



(d)   (Reserved)



(e)   (Reserved)



Sec. 3.05-571.  Jeopardy assessments.  (Local Audits)



(a)   If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any assessment
or deficiency of any amounts imposed by this Chapter will be jeopardized by
delay, he shall deliver to the taxpayer a notice of such finding and demand
immediate payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy,
including interest, penalties, and additions.



(b)   Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the Tax
Collector may immediately begin proceedings for collection.  The taxpayer,
however, may stay collection by filing, within ten (10) days after receipt of
notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the Tax
Collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the City in the amount
Tax Collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice.



(c)   "Bond or Collateral", as required by this Section,



   (1)   Shall mean either:



      (A)   A bond issued in favor of the City by a surety company
authorized to transact business in this State and approved by the Director of
Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, or



      (B)   Collateral composed of securities or cash which are
deposited with, and kept in the custody of, the Tax Collector.



   (2)   Shall be of such form that it may, at any time without notice,
be applied to any tax, penalties, or interest due and payable for the
purposes of this Chapter.  Securities held as collateral by the Tax
Collector must be of a nature that they may be sold at public or private sale
without notice to the taxpayer.



(d)   If bond or collateral is not filed within the period prescribed by
subsection (b) above, the tax collector may treat the assessment as final for
purposes of any collection proceedings.  The taxpayer nevertheless shall be
afforded the appeal rights provided in Sections 3.05-570 and 3.05-575.  The
filing of a petition by the taxpayer under Section 3.05-570, however, shall
not stay the tax collector's rights to pursue any collection proceedings.



(e)   If the taxpayer timely files sufficient bond or collateral, the
jeopardy requirements are deemed satisfied, and the taxpayer may avail
himself of the provisions of Section 3.05-570, including requests for
additional time to file a petition.



Sec. 3.05-572.  (Reserved)  (State Administration and Audits)



Sec. 3.05-572.  Expedited review of jeopardy assessments.  (Local Audits)



(a)   Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the Tax Collector
furnishes the written notice required by Section 3.05-571(a), the taxpayer,
pursuant to Section 3.05-570, may request the Tax Collector to review the
action taken.  Within fifteen (15) days after the request for review, the
Tax Collector shall determine whether both the jeopardy determination and the
amount assessed are reasonable.



(b)   Within thirty (30) days after the Tax Collector notifies the
taxpayer of the determination he reached pursuant to subsection (a) above,
the taxpayer may bring a civil action in the appropriate court.  If the
taxpayer so requests, the City shall stipulate to an accelerated and
expedited resolution of the civil action.  If the court determines that
either the jeopardy determination or the amount assessed is unreasonable, the
court may order the Tax Collector to abate the assessment, to redetermine any
part of the amount assessed or to take such other action as the court finds
to be appropriate.  A determination made by the court under this subsection
is final except as provided in Arizona Revised Statutes Section 12-170.



Sec. 3.05-575.  Judicial review.  (State Administration and Audits)



(a)   Appeal of a State Board of Tax Appeals decision to the courts is
valid only if all the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1254 are met.



(b)   (Reserved)



(c)   (Reserved)



(d)   (Reserved)



(e)   The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence
in any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining
the tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any
requirement of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item
of gross income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit.  This
subsection applies to a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence
demonstrates that:



   (1)   The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue.



   (2)   The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector
regarding the issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time,
access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within
the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector.



   (3)   The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by
the City.



(f)   The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of
refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the
decision of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the
City or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or
estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to
recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original
assessment.



(g)   After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by
either party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be
allowed pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.



Sec. 3.05-575.  Judicial review.  (Local Audits)



(a)   A taxpayer may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing
Officer's decision by initiating an action against the City in the
appropriate Court of this County.  A taxpayer is not required to pay any
tax, penalty, or interest upheld by the hearing officer before seeking such
judicial review.



(b)   The Tax Collector may seek judicial review of all or any part of a
Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action in the appropriate Court
of this County.



(c)   An action for judicial review can not be commenced by either the
taxpayer or the Tax Collector more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the
taxpayer of notice of any refund or assessment recalculated or reduced to
conform to the Hearing Officer's decision, unless the time to commence such
an action is extended in writing signed by both the taxpayer and the Tax
Collector.  Failure to bring the action within thirty (30) days or such
other time as is agreed upon in writing shall constitute a waiver of any
right to judicial review, except as provided in subsection (g) below.



(d)   The court shall hear and determine the appeal as a trial de novo;
however, the Tax Collector cannot raise in the court any grounds or basis for
the assessment not asserted before the Hearing Officer.  Nothing in this
subsection, however, shall preclude the Tax Collector from responding to any
arguments which are raised by the taxpayer in the appeal.



(e)   The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence
in any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining
the tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any
requirement of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item
of gross income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit.  This
subsection applies to a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence
demonstrates that:



   (1)   The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue.



   (2)   The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector
regarding the issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time,
access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within
the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector.



   (3)   The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by
the City.



(f)   The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of
refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the
decision of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the
City or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or
estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to
recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original
assessment.



(g)   After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by
either party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be
allowed pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.

Sec. 3.05-578.  (Reserved)  (State Administration and Audits)



Sec. 3.05-578.  Reimbursement of fees and other costs; definitions.  (Local
Audits)



(a)   A taxpayer who is a prevailing party may be reimbursed for
reasonable fees and other costs related to any administrative proceeding
brought by the taxpayer pursuant to Section 3.05-570(b).  For purposes of
this Section, a taxpayer is considered to be the prevailing party only if
both of the following are true:



   (1)   The Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified.



   (2)   The taxpayer prevails as to the most significant issue or set
of issues.



(b)   Reimbursement under this Section may be denied if any of the
following  circumstances apply:



   (1)   During the course of the proceeding the taxpayer unduly and
unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter.



   (2)   The reason that the taxpayer prevailed is due to an
intervening change in the applicable law.



(c)   The taxpayer shall present an itemization of the reasonable fees and
other costs to the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer within thirty (30)
days after receipt by the taxpayer of a notice of refund or recalculated
assessment issued by the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 3.05-570(b)(8). 
The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer shall determine the validity of the
fees and other costs within thirty (30) days after receiving the
itemization.  The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision is
considered a final decision.  Either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector may
seek judicial review of the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision. 
An action for judicial review, however, shall not be commenced more than
thirty (30) days after receipt of the resolution officer's decision.



(d)   In the event judicial review is not sought pursuant to subsection
(c) above, the City shall pay the fees and other costs awarded as provided in
this Section within thirty days after demand by a person who has received an
award pursuant to this Section.



(e)   Reimbursement to a taxpayer under this Section shall not exceed
twenty thousand dollars or actual monies spent, whichever is less.  The
reimbursable attorney or representative fees shall not exceed one hundred
dollars per hour or actual monies spent, whichever is less, unless the
Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer determines that an increase in the cost
of living or a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified
attorneys or representatives for the proceeding involved justifies a higher
fee.



(f)   For purposes of this Section "reasonable fees and other costs" means
fees and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind
and quality of the furnished services, but not exceeding the amounts actually
spent for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test or
project that is found to be necessary to prepare the party's case and
necessary fees for attorneys or other representatives.



Sec. 3.05-580.  Criminal penalties.

   (1)   Fail or refuse to make any return required by this Chapter.



   (2)   Fail to remit as and when due the full amount of any tax or
additional tax or penalty and interest thereon.



   (3)   Make or cause to be made a false or fraudulent return.



   (4)   Make or cause to be made a false or fraudulent statement in a
return, in written support of a return, or to demonstrate or support
entitlement to a deduction, exclusion, or credit or to entitle the person to
an allocation or apportionment or receipts subject to tax.



   (5)   Fail or refuse to permit any lawful examination of any book,
account, record, or other memorandum by the Tax Collector.



   (6)   Fail or refuse to remit any tax collected by such person from
his customer to the Tax Collector before the delinquency date next following
such collection.



   (7)   Advertise or hold out to the public in any manner, directly or
indirectly, that any tax imposed by this Chapter, as provided in this
Chapter, is not considered as an element in the price to the consumer.



   (8)   Fail or refuse to obtain a Privilege License or to aid or abet
another in any attempt to intentionally refuse to obtain such a license or
evade the license fee.



   (9)   Reproduce, forge, falsify, fraudulently obtain or secure, or
aid or abet another in any attempt to reproduce, forge, falsify, or
fraudulently obtain or secure, an exemption from taxes imposed by this
Chapter.



(b)   The violation of any provision of subsection (a) above shall
constitute a Class One Misdemeanor.



(c)   In addition to the foregoing penalties, any person who shall
knowingly swear to or verify any false or fraudulent statement, with the
intent aforesaid, shall be guilty of the offense of perjury and on conviction
thereof shall be punished in the manner provided by law.



Sec. 3.05-590.  Civil actions.  (State Administration and Audits)



(a)   Liens.



   (1)   Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which
has become final, as provided in this Chapter, shall become a lien when the
City perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the
taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods
for which the same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the
recording costs by the county recorder in any county in which the taxpayer
owns real property and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by
the City council and further, stating that the City claims a lien therefor.



   (2)   The notice of claim of lien shall be signed by the tax
collector under his official seal or the official seal of the City, and, with
respect to real property, shall be recorded in the office of the County
Recorder of any county in which the taxpayer owns real property, and, with
respect to personal property shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of
State.  After the notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes,
penalties, interest and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to
above in the amounts specified therein shall be a lien on all real property
of the taxpayer located in such county where recorded, and all tangible
personal property of the taxpayer within the State, superior to all other
liens and assessments recorded or filed subsequent to the recording or filing
of the notice and claim of lien.



   (3)   Every tax and any increases, interest, penalties, and
recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above, shall become from
the time the same is due and payable a personal debt from the person liable
to the City, but shall be payable to and recoverable by the Tax Collector and
which may be collected in the manner set forth in subsection (b) below.



   (4)   Any lien perfected pursuant to this Section shall, upon
payment of the taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs and lien
processing fees referred to above and lien release fees imposed by the county
recorder in any county in which the lien was recorded, thereby, be released
by the Tax Collector in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are
released.  The Tax Collector may, at his sole discretion, release a lien in
part, that is, against only specified property, for partial payment of moneys
due the City.



(b)   Actions to recover tax.  The Arizona Department of Revenue, or any
agent or representative authorized by that Department, may bring action, in
the name of the city, to recover taxes as provided in A.R.S. Section 42-1114.



Sec. 3.05-590.  Civil actions.  (Local Audits)



(a)   Liens.



   (1)   Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which
has become final, as provided in this Chapter, shall become a lien when the
City perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the
taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods
for which the same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the
recording costs by the county recorder in any county in which the taxpayer
owns real property and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by
the City council and further, stating that the City claims a lien therefor.



   (2)   The notice of claim of lien shall be signed by the tax
collector under his official seal or the official seal of the City, and, with
respect to real property, shall be recorded in the office of the County
Recorder of any county in which the taxpayer owns real property, and, with
respect to personal property shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of
State.  After the notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes,
penalties, interest and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to
above in the amounts specified therein shall be a lien on all real property
of the taxpayer located in such county where recorded, and all tangible
personal property of the taxpayer within the State, superior to all other
liens and assessments recorded or filed subsequent to the recording or filing
of the notice and claim of lien.



   (3)   Every tax and any increases, interest, penalties, and
recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above, shall become from
the time the same is due and payable a personal debt from the person liable
to the City, but shall be payable to and recoverable by the Tax Collector and
which may be collected in the manner set forth in subsection (b) below.



   (4)   Any lien perfected pursuant to this Section shall, upon
payment of the taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs and lien
processing fees referred to above and lien release fees imposed by the county
recorder in any county in which the lien was recorded, thereby, be released

part, that is, against only specified property, for partial payment of moneys
due the City.



(b)   Actions to recover tax.  An action may be brought by the City
Attorney or other legal advisor to the City designated by the City Council,
at the request of the Tax Collector, in the name of the City, to recover the
amount of any taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs, lien processing
fees and lien release fees due under this Chapter; provided that:



   (1)   No action or proceeding may be taken or commenced to collect
any taxes levied by this Chapter until the amount thereof has been
established by assessment, correction, or reassessment; and



   (2)   Such collection effort is made or the proceedings begun:



      (A)   Within six (6) years after the assessment of the tax; or



      (B)   Prior to the expiration of any period of collection
agreed upon in writing by the Tax Collector and the taxpayer before the
expiration of such six (6) year period, or any extensions thereof; or



      (C)   At any time for the collection of tax arising by reason
of a tax lien perfected, recorded, or possessed by the City under this
Section.



Sec. 3.05-595.  Collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or
cessation of business.



(a)    In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in this City Code that
may apply, the Tax Collector may apply the provisions of subsections (b)
through (d) below concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession
in and/or cessation of business.



(b)    The taxes imposed by this Chapter are a lien on the property of any
person subject to this Chapter who sells his business or stock of goods, or
quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of
the tax within fifteen (15) days after selling or quitting his business.



(c)    Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale
under trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other
method, improved real property or a portion of improved real property for
which the Privilege Tax imposed by this Chapter has not been paid shall be
responsible for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner
builder, as provided in Sections 3.04-416 and 3.04-417.



   (1)   any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of creditor, who
acquires improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor's
debtor by any means set forth in this subsection, shall pay the tax based on
the amount received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of
such improved real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless
of when such subsequent sale takes place.  Such tax shall be due in the
month following the month in which the sale of the improved real property by
the creditor or its affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
real property meets the definition of partially improved residential real
property in Section 3.04-416(a)(4) and all of the requirements of Section
3.04-416(b)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction,
then the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale.



   (2)   In the event a creditor or its affiliate uses the acquired
improved real property for any business purpose, other than operating the
property in the manner in which it was operated, or was intended to be
operated, before the acquisition or in any other manner unrelated to selling
the property, the tax shall be due.  The gross income upon which the tax
shall be determined pursuant to Sections 3.04-416 and 3.04-417 shall be the
fair market value of the improved real property as of the date of
acquisition.  The tax shall be due in the month following the month in which
such first business use occurs.  When applicable, the credit bid shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of
acquisition.



   (3)   Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has
occurred and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it
pursuant to this subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any
future owner, shall be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest
that may continue to be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the
debtor to the creditor or its affiliate.



   (4)   If the tax liability imposed by either Section 3.04-416 or
Section 3.04-417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the
creditor or its affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the tax collector
by the debtor subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its
affiliate, the amount so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably
determined by the tax collector in good faith, against the tax imposed on the
creditor or its affiliate by either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this
subsection.



   (5)   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, if a
creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in paragraph 1 or
paragraph 2 of this subsection and such creditor or affiliate has not
previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall
become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due.



(d)   A person's successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase
money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and
interest or penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a
receipt from the Tax Collector showing that all City tax has been paid or a
certificate stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the
Tax Collector.  The Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller
for a certificate within fifteen (15) days by either providing the
certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued.



   (1)    If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the
sale of the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does
not constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate
from the Tax Collector.



   (2)   If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to
obtain a certificate as provided by this Section, he is personally liable for
payment of the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on
account of the business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by
the former owner or assignees.

imposed on the activity on behalf of the principal.  No deduction shall be
allowed for any commissions or fees retained by such broker, except as
provided in Section 3.04-405, relating to advertising commissions.



(b)   Brokers for vendors.  A broker acting for a seller, lessor, or
other similar person deriving gross income in a category upon which this
Chapter imposes a tax shall be liable for such tax, even if his principal
would not be subject to the tax if he conducted such activity in his own
behalf, by reason of the activity being deemed a "casual" one.  For example:



   (1)   An auctioneer or other sales agent of tangible personal
property is subject to the tax imposed upon retail sales, even if such sales
would be deemed "casual" if his principal had sold such items himself.



   (2)   A property manager is subject to the tax imposed upon rental,
leasing, or licensing of real property, even if such rental, leasing, or
licensing would be deemed "casual" if his principal managed such real
property himself.



(c)   Brokers for vendees.  A broker acting solely for a buyer, lessee,
tenant, or other similar person who is a party to a transaction which may be
subject to the tax, shall be liable for such tax and for filing a return in
connection with such tax only to the extent his principal is subject to the
tax.



(d)   The liability of a broker does not relieve the principal of
liability except upon presentation to the Tax Collector of proof of payment
of the tax, and only to the extent of the correct payment.  The broker shall
be relieved of the responsibility to file and pay taxes upon the filing and
correct payment of such taxes by the principal.



(e)   (Reserved)



(f)   Location of Business.  Retail sales by brokers acting for another
person shall be deemed to have occurred at the regular business location of
the broker, in a manner similar to that used to determine "out-of-City
sales"; provided, however, that an auctioneer is deemed to be engaged in
business at the site of each auction.



Reg. 3.07-100.2.  Delivery, installation, or other direct customer services.



(a)   "Delivery Charges" exist only when the total charges to the ultimate
customer or consumer include, as separately charged to the ultimate customer,
charges for delivery to the ultimate consumer, whether the place of delivery
is within or without the City, and when the taxpayer's books and records show
the separate delivery charges.



   (1)   Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed
price has "delivery included" or other similar expression is insufficient to
show the delivery as a separate charge.  Only the separately stated charge
for the delivery shall be deemed a "delivery charge".



   (2)   Freight in.  Charges for delivery from place of production or
the manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of
wholesalers or jobbers or other middlemen are deemed "freight-in" and are not
considered delivery.



(b)   "Installation", as used in this definition, relates only to tangible
personal property.  Installation to real property is deemed construction
contracting in this Chapter.  Examples of installation relating to tangible
personal property are:  installing a radio in an automobile; applying sun
screens on the windows of a boat; installing cabinets, carpeting, or
"built-in appliances" to a camper or motorized recreational vehicle.



(c)   Repair of tangible personal property is not included in this
definition.  See Regulation 3.07-465.1.



(d)   "Direct Customer Services" means services other than repair rendered
directly to the customer.  Services or labor provided by any person prior to
the transfer of tangible personal property to the customer or consumer are
not included in this definition.  In the following examples, the
requirements of subsection (e) below are referred to by the words "identify"
or "identification."



   (1)   A retailer sells a customer a $100 "plug-in" appliance, with a
$25 delivery and installation charge.  If the retailer identifies the $25
delivery and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services.



   (2)   A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink
served, $300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and
waiters.  If all charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set up
and cleanup is a charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food
and service is restauranting gross income.



   (3)   Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or
persons engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such
charges for labor as direct customer services.



   (4)   All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a
photograph (sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching,
etc.) for services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property
are not direct customer services.



   (5)   An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may
consider such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if
such charge is properly identified.



   (6)   Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the
production of any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry,
artwork, tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as
such labor occurs prior to the transfer of property.



(e)   Recordkeeping requirements.



   (1)   Any person who engages in transactions involving these
services must:



      (A)   Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for
such services in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily
identify the specific dollar amount of the service charge; and



      (B)   Maintain business books and records in a manner in which
the separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the
satisfaction of the Tax Collector.



   (2)   Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction
involving such services and the transfer of tangible personal property which
only indicates the total amount of the charges with words such as "services
included" or "charge includes labor and parts" or similar a expression does
not satisfy the requirements of this subsection.



Reg. 3.07-100.3.  Retailers.



When in the opinion of the Tax Collector it is necessary for efficient
administration of this Chapter, he may regard any salesman, representative,
peddler, canvasser, or agent of any dealer, distributor, supervisor, or
employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal
property for sale, rental, lease, or license as a retailer for the purposes
of this Chapter, irrespective of whether he is making sales, rentals, leases,
or licenses on his own behalf or on behalf of others.  The Tax Collector may
also regard such dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer as a retailer
for the purposes of this Chapter.



Reg. 3.01-100.4.  Out-of-City/Out-of-State Sales:  Sales to Native
Americans.



Sales to Native Americans or tribal councils by vendors located within the
City shall be deemed sales within the City, unless all of the following
conditions exist:



   (1)   The vendor has properly accounted for such sales, in a manner
similar to the recordkeeping requirements for out-of-City sales; and,



   (2)   All of the following elements of the sale exist:



(a)   Solicitation and placement of the order occurs on the reservation;
and



(b)   Delivery is made to the reservation; and



(c)   Payment originates from the reservation.



Reg. 3.07-100.5.  Remediation Contracting.



The following activities are considered remediation contracting and are
exempt:



   (1)   Excavation, transportation, treatment, and/or disposal of
contaminated soil for purposes of site remediation (rather than
characterization);



   (2)   Installation of groundwater extraction and/or injection wells
for purposes of groundwater remediation;



   (3)   Installation of pumps and piping into groundwater extraction
wells for remediation purposes;



   (4)   Installation of vapor extraction wells for the purpose of soil
or groundwater remediation;



   (5)   Construction of remediation systems, such as groundwater
treatment plants, vapor extraction systems, or air injection systems;



   (6)   Connection of remediation systems to utilities;



   (7)   Abandonment of groundwater or vapor extraction wells;



   (8)   Removal/demolition of remediation systems;



   (9)   Capping/closure construction activities; and



   (10)   Service or handling charges for subcontracted remediation
contracting activities.



Reg. 3.07-115.1.  Computer hardware, software, and data services.



(a)   Definitions.



   (1)   "Computer Hardware" (also called "computer equipment" or
"peripherals") is the components and accessories which constitute the
physical computer assembly, including but not limited to:  central
processing unit, keyboard, console, monitor, memory unit, disk drive, tape
drive or reader, terminal, printer, plotter, modem, document sorter, optical
reader and/or digitizer, network.



   (2)   "Computer Software" (also called "computer program") is
tangible personal property, and includes:



      (A)   "Operating Program (Software)" (also called "executive
program (software)"), which is the programming system or technical language
upon which or by means of which the basic operating procedures of the
computer are recorded.  The operating program serves as an interface with
user applied programs and allows the user to access the computer's processing
capabilities.



      (B)   "Applied Program (Software)", which is the programming
system or technical language (including the tape, disk, cards, or other
medium upon which such language or program is recorded) designed either for
application in a specialized use, or upon which or by means of which a plan
for the solution of a particular problem is based.  Typically, applied
programs can be transferred from one computer to another via storage media. 
Examples of applied programs include:  payroll processing, general ledger,
sales data, spreadsheet, word processing, and data management programs.



   (3)   "Storage Medium" is any hard disk, compact disk, floppy disk,
diskette, diskpack, magnetic tape, cards, or other medium used for storage of
information in a form readable by a computer, but not including the memory of
the computer itself.



   (4)   A "Terminal Arrangement" (also called "'on-line' arrangement")
is any agreement allowing access to a remote central processing unit through
telecommunications via hardware.



   (5)   A "Computer Services Agreement" (also called "data services
agreement") is an agreement allowing access to a computer through a
third-party operator.



(b)   For the purposes of this Chapter, transfer of title and possession
of the following are deemed sales of tangible personal property and any other
transfer of title, possession, or right to use for a consideration of the
following is deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal
property:



   (1)   Computer hardware or storage media.  Rental, leasing, or
licensing for use of computer hardware or storage media includes the lessee's
use of such hardware or storage media on the lessor's premises.



   (2)   Computer software which is not custom computer programming. 
Such prewritten ("canned") programs may be transferred to a customer in the
form of punched cards, magnetic tape, or other storage medium, or by listing
the program instructions on coding sheets.  Transfer is deemed to have
occurred whether title to the storage medium upon which the program is
recorded, coded, or punched passes to the customer or the program is
recorded, coded, or punched on storage medium furnished by the customer. 
Gross income from the transfer of such prewritten programs includes:



      (A)   The entire amount charged to the customer for the sale,
rental, lease, or license for use of the storage medium or coding sheets on
which or into which the prewritten program has been recorded, coded, or
punched.



      (B)   The entire amount charged for the temporary transfer or
possession of a prewritten program to be directly used or to be recorded,
coded, or punched by the customer on the customer's premises.

extended periods, relating to the use of a prewritten program.



      (D)   The entire amount charged for transfer of a prewritten
("canned") program by remote telecommunications from the transferor's place
of business to or through the customer's computer.



      (E)   Any charge for the purchase of a maintenance contract
which entitles the customer to receive storage media on which prewritten
program improvements or error corrections have been recorded or to receive
telephone or on-site consultation services, provided that:



(i)   If such maintenance contract is not optional with the customer, then
the charges for the maintenance contract, including the consultation
services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the prewritten program.



(ii)   If such maintenance contract is optional with the customer but the
customer does not have the option to purchase the consultation services
separately from the storage media containing the improvements or error
corrections, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the
consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the
prewritten program.



(iii)   If such maintenance contract is optional with the customer and the
customer may purchase the consultation services separately from the storage
media containing the improvements or error corrections, then only the charges
for such improvements or error corrections are deemed gross income from the
transfer of a prewritten program and charges for consultation are deemed to
be charges for professional services.



(c)   Producing the following by means of computer hardware is deemed to
be the activity of job printing for the purposes of this Chapter:



   (1)   Statistical reports, graphs, diagrams, microfilm, microfiche,
photorecordings, or any other information produced or compiled by a computer;
except as provided in subsection (e) below.



   (2)   Additional copies of records, reports, manuals, tabulations,
etc. "Additional Copies" are any copies in excess to those produced
simultaneously with the production of the original and on the same printer,
whether such copies are prepared by running the same program, by using
multiple printers, by looping the program, by using different programs to
produce the same output, or by other means.



(d)   Charges for the use of communications channel in conjunction with a
terminal arrangement or data services agreement are deemed gross income from
the activity of providing telecommunication services.



(e)   The following transactions are deemed direct customer services,
provided that charges for such services are separately stated and maintained
as provided by Regulation 3.07-100.2(e):



   (1)   "Custom (Computer) Programming", which is any computer
software which is written or prepared for a single customer, including those
services represented by separately stated charges for the modification of
existing prewritten programs.



      (A)   Custom computer programming is deemed a professional
service regardless of the form in which the programming is transferred.



      (B)   Custom programming includes such programming performed
in connection with the sale, rental, lease, or license for use of computer
hardware, provided that the charges for such are separately stated from the
charges for the hardware.



      (C)   Custom computer programming includes a program prepared
to the special order of a customer who will use the program to produce copies
of the program for sale, rental, lease, or license.  The subsequent sale,
rental, lease, or license of such a program is deemed the sale, rental,
lease, or license of a prewritten program.



   (2)   Training services related to computer hardware or software,
provided further that:



      (A)   The provider of such training services is deemed the
ultimate consumer of all tangible personal property used in training others
or provided to such trainees without separately itemized charge for the
materials provided.



      (B)   Training deemed a direct customer service does not
include:



         (i)   Training materials, books, manuals, etc. furnished
to customers for a charge separate from the charge for training services.



         (ii)   Training provided to customers without separate
charge as part of the sale, rental, lease, or license of computer hardware or
software, or as part of a terminal arrangement or data services agreement.



   (3)   The use of computer time through the use of a terminal
arrangement or a data service agreement, but not charges for computer
hardware located at the customer's place of business (for example, the
terminal, a printer attached to the terminal, a modem used to communicate
with the remote central processing unit over a telephone line).



   (4)   Compiling and producing, as part of a terminal arrangement or
computer services agreement, original copies of statistical reports, graphs,
diagrams, microfilm, microfiche, photorecordings, or other information for
the same person who supplied the raw data used to create such reports.



(f)   The purchase, rental, lease, or license for use of computer
hardware, storage media, or computer software which is not deemed custom
programming is deemed the use or storage of tangible personal property for
the purpose of this Chapter, and the amount which may be subject to Use Tax
shall be determined in the same manner as the determination of the gross
income from the sale, rental, lease, or license for use of such.



Reg. 3.07-200.1.  When deposits are includable in gross income.



(a)   Refundable deposits shall be includable as gross income of the
taxpayer for the month in which the deposits are forfeited by the lessee.



(b)   (Reserved)



Reg. 3.07-250.1.  Excess tax collected.



If a taxpayer collects taxes in excess of the combined tax rate from any
customer in any transaction, all such excess tax shall be paid to the taxing
jurisdictions in proportion to their effective rates.  The right of the
taxpayer to charge his customer for his own liability for tax does not allow
the taxpayer to enrich himself at the cost of his customers.  Tax paid on an
activity that is not subject to tax or that qualifies for an exemption,
deduction, exclusion or credit is not excess tax collected.



Reg. 3.07-270.1.  Proprietary activities of municipalities are not
considered activities of a governmental entity.



The following activities, when performed by a municipality, are considered to
be activities of a person engaged in business for the purposes of this
Chapter, and not excludable by reason of Section 3.02-270:



(a)   Rental, leasing, or licensing for use of real property to other than
another department or agency of the municipality.



(b)   Producing, providing, or furnishing electricity, electric lights,
current, power, gas (natural or artificial), or water to consumers or
ratepayers.



(c)   Sale of tangible personal property to the public, when similar
tangible personal property is available for sale by other persons, as, for
example, at police or surplus auctions.



(d)   Providing wastewater removal services to consumers or ratepayers by
means of sewer lines or similar pipelines.



(Ord. 14-1115, passed 9-23-2014)



Reg. 3.07-270.2.  Proprietary clubs.



(a)   Equity requirements.  In order to qualify for exclusion under
Section 3.02-270, a proprietary club must actually be owned by the members. 
For the purposes of qualification, a club will be deemed to be member-owned
if at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the equity of the total amount of
club-owned property is owned by bona fide individual members whose membership
is represented in the form of shares, certificates, bonds, or other indicia
of capital interest.  A corporation may be considered an individual owner
provided that it owns a membership solely for the benefit of one or more of
its employees and it is not engaged in any business activity connected with
the operation of the club.



(b)   Gross revenue requirements.  In computing gross revenue for the
computation of this fifteen percent (15%) rule of subsection 3.02-270(c)(1),



   (1)   The following shall be excluded:



      (A)   Membership dues.



      (B)   Membership fees which relate to the general admission to
the club on a periodic (or perpetual) basis.



      (C)   Assessments.

actual use of a facility or part thereof.



      (B)   Pro shop sales if the shop is owned by the club.



      (C)   Golf cart rental if the carts are owned by the club.



      (D)   Rentals, percentages, or commissions received for

      (E)   All receipts from food or beverage sales, room use or
rental charge, corkage and catering charges, and similar receipts.



      (F)   Locker and locker room fees and attendants charges if
paid to the club.



      (G)   Tournament entry fees other than entry fees for the one

Reg. 3.07-300.1.  Who must apply for a license.



(a)   For the purposes of determining whether a license is required under
Section 3.03-300, a person shall be deemed to be "engaged in or continuing in
business" within the City, if he meets any of the following conditions:



   (1)   He is engaged in any activity subject to the City's Privilege
Taxes as principal or broker.

whether such person or subsidiary is authorized or licensed to do business in
this State or this City.



   (3)   He is soliciting sales, orders, contracts, leases, and other
similar forms of business relationships, within the City from customers,
consumers, or users located within the City, by means of salesmen,
solicitors, agents, representatives, brokers, and other similar agents or by
means of catalogs or other advertising, whether such orders are received or
accepted within or without this City.



   (4)   He is regularly engaged in any activity subject to the City's

obtain a license because they acquire items outside the City for their own or
their family's personal use and enjoyment.



   (5)   He is required to report and pay the tax upon Rental Occupancy
imposed by Section 3.04-440.



(b)   For the purposes of obtaining a Privilege License, a person who has
less than three (3) apartments, houses, trailer spaces, or other lodging
spaces available for rent, lease, or license within the State is not
considered to be regularly engaged in business and need not obtain a
Privilege License; provided, however, if that person is also receiving income
from the activity of renting, leasing, or licensing one (1) or more
commercial properties or units within a commercial property, he is considered
to be regularly engaged in business and must obtain licenses for all his
rental, lease, or license property.

Reg. 3.07-350.1.  Recordkeeping:  income.



The minimum records required for persons having gross income subject to, or
exempt or excluded from, tax by this Chapter must show:



(a)   The gross income of the taxpayer attributable to any activity
occurring in whole or in part in the City.



(b)   The gross income taxable under this Chapter, divided into categories
as stated in the official City tax return.



(c)   The gross income subject to Arizona Transaction Privilege Taxes,
divided into categories as stated in the official State tax return.



(d)   The gross income claimed to be exempt, and with respect to each
activity or transaction so claimed:



   (1)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt as a sale for
resale or as a sale, rental, lease, or license for use of rental equipment:



      (A)   The City Privilege License number and State Transaction
Privilege Tax License number of the customer (or the equivalent city, if
applicable, and state tax numbers of the city and state where the customer
resides), and



      (B)   The name, business address, and business activity of the
customer, and



      (C)   Evidence sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent

equipment, by the vendee in the ordinary and regular course of his business
activity, as provided by Regulation.



   (2)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt for any other
reason:



      (A)   The name, business address, and business activity of the
customer, and



      (B)   Evidence which would establish the applicability of the
exemption to a reasonably prudent businessman acting in good faith. 
Ordinary business documentation which would reasonably indicate the
applicability of an exemption shall be sufficient to relieve the person on
whom the tax would otherwise be imposed from liability therein, if he acts in
good faith as provided by Regulation.



(e)   With respect to those allowed deductions or exclusions for tax
collected or charges for delivery or other direct customer services, where
applicable, evidence that the deductible income has been separately stated
and shown on the records of the taxpayer and on invoices or receipts provided
to the customer.  All other deductions, exemptions, and exclusions shall be
separately shown and substantiated.



(f)   With respect to special classes and activities, such other books,
records, and documentation as the Tax Collector, by regulation, shall deem
necessary for specific classes of taxpayer by reason of the specialized

the Tax Collector that the exemption claimed is applicable.



(e)   As applicable to each taxpayer, documentation sufficient to the Tax
Collector, so that he may ascertain:



   (1)   All construction expenditures and all Privilege and Use Taxes
claimed paid, relating to owner-builders and speculative builders.



   (2)   Disbursement of collected gratuities and related payroll
information required of restaurants.



   (3)   Franchise and license fee payments and computations thereto
which relate to:



      (A)   Utility service



      (B)   Telecommunication service.



   (4)   The validity of any claims of proof of exemption, as provided
by Regulation.



   (5)   A claimed alternative prior value for reconstruction.



   (6)   All claimed exemptions to the Use Tax imposed by Article VI of
this Chapter.



   (7)   (Reserved)



   (8)   Payments of tax to the Arizona Department of Transportation
and computations therefor, when a motor-vehicle transporter claims such the
exemption.



   (9)   Payments by tenants subject to the tax upon Rental Occupancy

(f)   Any additional documentation as the Tax Collector, by Regulation,
shall deem necessary for any specific class of taxpayer by reason of the
specialized business activity of specific exemptions afforded to that class
of taxpayer.



(g)   In all cases, the books and records of the taxpayer shall indicate
both individual transaction amounts and totals for each reporting period for
each category of taxable, exempt, and excluded expenditures as defined by
this Chapter.



Reg. 3.07-350.3.  Recordkeeping:  out-of-City and out-of-State sales.



(a)   Out-of-City Sales.  Any person engaging or continuing in a business
who claims out-of-City sales shall maintain and keep accounting records or
books indicating separately the gross income from the sales of tangible
personal property from such out-of-City branches or locations.



(b)   Out-of-State Sales.  Persons engaged in a business claiming
out-of-State sales shall maintain accounting records or books indicating for
each out-of-State sale the following documentation:



   (1)   (Reserved)



   (2)   Documentation of residency of the buyer, determined in the
manner one determines if a person "resides within the City"; and



   (3)   Shipping, delivery, or freight documents showing where the
buyer took delivery; and



   (4)   Documentation of intended location of use or storage of the
tangible personal property sold to such buyer.



Reg. 3.07-360.1.  Proof of exemption:  sale for resale; sale, rental,
lease, or license of rental equipment.



A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for
rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to
persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being
acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course
of business.  The fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege
License number, and makes a verbal claim of "sale for resale or lease" or
"lease for re-lease" does not meet this burden and is insufficient to justify
an exemption.  The "reasonable evidence" must be evidence which exists
objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the property
being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the acquiring
person in the ordinary course of business.  Failure to obtain such
reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for
disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions.



Reg. 3.07-360.2.  Proof of exemption:  exemption certificate.



For the purpose of proof of exemption, in transactions other than those in
which the proof is set by standard documentation as detailed inRegulations
3.07-350.1 and 3.07-360.1, the minimum acceptable proof and documentation for
each transaction shall be the completion, at the time of the transaction, in
all material respects, of a certificate containing all the information set
forth below.  For the purpose of validating the vendor's claim of exemption,
such certificate is sufficient if executed by any person with apparent
authority to act for the customer, and the information provided validates the
claim.

(a)   In General.  Except as provided elsewhere in this regulation, a
person engaged in advertising activity shall be considered to be doing
business entirely within the City if all or a major portion of the
dissemination facilities such as broadcasting studios, printing plants, or

Reg. 3.07-407.1.  (Reserved)



Reg. 3.07-415.1.  Distinction between the categories of construction
contracting.



For the purposes of this Chapter, transactions involving improvements to, or
sales of, real property are designated into one of the following categories,
and these categorizations shall apply, whether or not a person designates
himself as a contractor, construction manager, developer, or otherwise:



(a)   A person performing improvements to real property is one of the
following:



   (1)   An "Owner-Builder" when the work is performed by the owner or
lessor or lessee-in-possession.  An "owner-builder" may also be a
"speculative builder".



   (2)   A "Construction Contractor" when performing work for the owner
or lessor or lessee-in-possession of the real property, unless that person
has provided a written declaration stating that:



      (A)   The owner-builder is improving the property for sale; and



      (B)   The owner-builder is liable for the tax for such
construction contracting activity; and



      (C)   The owner-builder has provided the contractor his City
Privilege License number.



   (3)   A "Subcontractor" as provided in Section 3.04-415 (c).



(b)   An owner or lessor ("owner-builder") of improved real property is
one of the following:



   (1)   A "Speculative Builder" as provided in Section 3.01-100; or



   (2)   An "owner builder who is not a speculative builder" in all
other cases.



(c)   The terms "owner", "lessor", and "lessee-in-possession" shall be
deemed to include any authorized agent for such person.



Reg. 3.07-415.2.  Distinction between construction contracting and certain
related activities.



(a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting.  Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting
activity.  Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal
property (with or without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an
operator shall be deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal
property.  For example:



   (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving
equipment with operator is construction contracting.  Rental of these items
without an operator is rental of tangible personal property.



   (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is
rental of tangible personal property.



   (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal
property, whether or not an operator is provided with the equipment rented.



(b)   Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain
direct customer service activities.



   (1)   When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is
a construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.



   (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are
retail sales.



   (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached
or installed are considered direct customer service activities (for
example:  carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscaping maintenance).



   (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are
considered construction contracting.



(c)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real
property is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. 
Examples of consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air
conditioning coolant, but not paint.



(d)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.



   (1)   "Tangible personal property which has independent functional
utility" must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without
attachment to real property.  "Attachment to real property" must include
more than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.



   (2)   Examples of tangible personal property which has independent
functional utility include artwork, furnishings, "plug-in" kitchen equipment,
or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.



   (3)   Examples of tangible personal property which does not have
independent functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring,
wallpaper, kitchen cabinets, or "built-in" dishwashers or ranges.



   (4)   The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds,
etc.) is always a retail activity.



Reg. 3.07-415.3.  Construction contracting; tax rate effective date.



(a)   In the event of a tax rate change, the rate imposed on gross income
from construction contracting shall be computed based upon the rate in effect
when the contract was executed, subject to the "enactment date" as defined in
this section. Gross income from a contract executed prior to the enactment
date shall not be subject to the tax rate change, provided the contract
contains no provision that entitles the construction contractor to recover
the amount of the tax.



(b)   In the event of a rate increase, in order to qualify for the lower
rate, the construction contractor shall, upon request, provide sufficient
documentation, in a manner and form prescribed by the tax collector, to
verify that a contract was entered into before the enactment date.



(c)   For purposes of this section, "enactment date" shall be:



   (1)   In the event an election is held, the date of election.



   (2)   In the event no election is held, the date of final adoption
by the mayor and council.



   (3)   Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the town from establishing a later enactment date.



Reg. 3.07-416.1.  Speculative builders:  homeowner's bona fide non-business
sale of a family residence.



(a)   A sale of a custom home, regardless of the stage of completion of
such home shall be considered a "homeowner's bona fide non-business sale" and
not subject to the tax on speculative builders if:



   (1)   The property was actually used as the principal place of
family residence or vacation residence by the immediate family of the seller
for the six (6) months next prior to the offer for sale; and



   (2)   The seller has not sold more than two (2) such residences (or,
if the residence is a vacation residence, two (2) such vacation residences)
within the thirty-six (36) months immediately prior to the offer for sale; and



   (3)   The seller has not licensed, leased, or rented the sold
premises for any period within twenty-four (24) months prior to the offer for
sale.



(b)   In the event that a homeowner of a family residence contracts with a
licensed construction contractor for improvements to a residence, the
construction contracting on a family residence shall be presumed to be for an
owner's bona fide non-business purpose and all construction contractors shall
be required to report and pay the tax imposed on all such improvements.



(c)   Purchases by a homeowner of tangible personal property for inclusion
in any construction, alteration, or repair of his residence shall be subject
to tax as retail sales to the ultimate consumer.



(d)   "Owner" and "Homeowner" as used in this Regulation shall only mean
an individual, and no other entity, association, or representative shall
qualify; except that an administrator, executor, personal representative, or
guardian in guardianship or probate proceedings, for the estate of a deceased
or incompetent person or a minor, may claim "homeowner" status for such
person if such person would have otherwise qualified with respect to the
specific property involved.



Reg. 3.07-416.2.  Reconstruction contracting.



(a)   "Reconstruction (of Real Property)" shall mean the subdividing of
real property and, in addition, all construction contracting activities
performed upon said real property; provided, however, that each of the
following conditions are met:



   (1)   A structure existed on said real property prior to the
reconstruction activity; and



   (2)   The "prior value" of said structure exceeds fifteen percent
(15%) of the "prior value" of the integrated property (land, improvements,
and structure); and



   (3)   The total cost of all construction contracting activities
performed on said real property in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to
the sale of any part of the real property exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of
the "prior value" of the real property; and



   (4)   The structure which existed on the real property prior to the
reconstruction activity still exists in some form upon the property, and is
included, in whole or in part, in the property sold.



(b)   Except as provided in subsection (c) below, "prior value" means the
value of the total integrated property, with improvements, as existing
immediately prior to any reconstruction activity.  Where, according to Title
42 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a property's full cash value for
secondary tax purposes is intended to represent the property's fair market
value, "prior value" shall be the property's full cash value for secondary
property tax purposes as determined by the County Assessor in the year
immediately preceding the year in which the reconstruction improvement(s) are
or could have been included in the County Assessor's valuation.  If the
County Assessor's valuation is contested or appealed, the final determination
at either the administrative or judicial level shall apply.  Where,
according to Title 42 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a property's full cash
value for secondary property tax purposes is not intended to represent the
property's fair market value, "prior value" shall be the property's fair
market value prior to the reconstruction improvement(s).



(c)   "Alternative Prior Value" shall mean that as an alternative to the
"prior value" defined above, the taxpayer may use his actual cost of the
reconstructed property prior to the reconstruction, provided that evidence of
such cost is presented to the Tax Collector and is determined by the Tax
Collector, in his sole discretion, to be satisfactory.  Such evidence shall
consist, at a minimum, of proof of the actual, arms-length acquisition price,
accompanied by a full appraisal of all property involved which appraisal
shall have been performed by a real estate broker or MAI appraiser
specifically for the purpose of assisting in the acquisition and further
shall have been performed on behalf of the seller or a lending institution
which has lent at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the acquisition price. 
(Only long term lending- not interim or construction financing will be
considered.)  This alternative value shall be used only if the property was
acquired by the reconstruction taxpayer not more than thirty-six (36) months
prior to a "sale" as defined below.



(d)   A "sale" for the purpose of determining "alternative prior value" or
"reconstruction" only shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the
execution of a contract of sale or a deed (joint tenancy or warranty)
whichever is earlier, to a purchaser or grantee of any single residential or
other occupancy unit.  In addition to the foregoing, a lease with option to
purchase a single residential unit shall be considered a "sale" at the date
of execution of such lease if said option is exercisable by the lessee in not
later than nine (9) months.  Further in the case of cooperative apartments,
the sale date shall be the date of execution of the contract selling (subject
or not to encumbrances, liens or security interests) of a share, or a
sufficient number of shares which entitle the purchaser to the occupancy of a
residential unit.  In all cases a person shall include a husband and wife as
a community, or any co-occupants of a single unit as joint tenants.



Reg. 3.07-425.1.  Distinction between job printing and certain related
activities.



(a)   Computerized Printing.  Computerized versions of all items which
would be taxable under Section 3.04-425 if performed without computerized
assistance are considered taxable under that Section, and therefore, are not
exempt services.



(b)   Book publishing.  The printing of books shall be deemed job
printing.  Sales of books shall be deemed retail sales.



(c)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not
be considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.



Reg. 3.07-435.1.  Distinction between publishing of periodicals and certain
related activities.



(a)   Book publishing shall not be considered publication of newspapers,
magazines, or other periodicals for purposes of this Chapter.  Sales of
books shall be deemed retail sales.  The printing of books shall be deemed
job printing.



(b)   Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not
be considered job printing for the purposes of this Chapter.



Reg. 3.07-435.2.  Advertising income of publishers and distributors of
newspapers and other periodicals.



Publishers and distributors of newspapers and other periodicals shall be
subject to the tax upon advertising imposed by Section 3.04-405 and such tax
shall be allocated in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) of Section
3.04-435.



Reg. 3.07-445.1.  When the rental, leasing, and licensing of real property
is exempt as "casual".



(a)   The person who has less than three (3) apartments, houses, trailer
spaces, or other lodging spaces rented, leased or licensed or available for
rent, lease, or license within the State and no units of commercial property
for rent lease, or license within the State is deemed not to be in the
business of renting, leasing, or licensing real property, and is therefore
exempt from the tax imposed by Section 3.04-445 on such income.  However, a
person who has one (1) or more units of any other real property is deemed to
be in the business of renting, leasing, or licensing real property, and
subject to the tax imposed by Section 3.04-445 on rental, lease, and license
income from all such lodging spaces and commercial units of real estate even
though said person may have fewer than three (3) lodging spaces within the
state.



(b)   (Reserved)



Reg. 3.07-445.3.  Rental, leasing, and licensing of real property as
lodging:  room and board; furnished lodging.



(a)   Room and board.



   (1)   Rooming houses, lodges, or other establishments providing both
lodging and meals, shall maintain a record of the separate charges made for
the lodging and the meals.



   (2)   The charge for lodging shall be subject to the tax imposed by
Section 3.04-444 or Section 3.04-445.  The charge for meals is subject to
the tax upon restaurants and bars prescribed by Section 3.04-455.



(b)   Furnished lodging.  A person who provides lodging with furnishings
shall be deemed to be only in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing
of lodging, and not in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of such
furnishings as tangible personal property, unless:



   (1)   Any tenant of any lodging space may choose to rent, lease, or
license such lodging space either furnished or unfurnished; and



   (2)   The lessor separately charges tenants for lodging and for
furnishings; and



   (3)   The lessor separately maintains his gross income from lodging
and from furnishings separately in his accounting books and records.



If all of the above conditions are met, such person shall report both sources
of income separately to the City.



Reg. 3.07-447.1.  (Repealed Effective 01-01-2007)



Reg. 3.07-450.1.  Distinction between rental, leasing, and licensing for use
of tangible personal property and certain related activities.



(a)   Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with
construction contracting.  Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving
equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting
activity.  Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal
property (with or without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an
operator shall be deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal
property.  For example:



   (1)   Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving
equipment with operator is construction contracting.  Rental of these items
without an operator is rental of tangible personal property.



   (2)   Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is
rental of tangible personal property.



   (3)   Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal
property, regardless of whether or not an operator is included with the
equipment rented.



(b)   Distinction between equipment rental, leasing, or licensing for use
and transporting for hire.  The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes,
airplanes, limousines, etc.) is considered rental, leasing, or licensing of
tangible personal property whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly
rate.  By comparison, the activity of a common carrier conveying goods or
persons for a fee based upon distance, and not time, shall be considered
transporting for hire.



Reg. 3.07-450.2.  Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible
personal property:  membership fees; other charges.



(a)   Membership, admission, or other fees charged by any rental club or
limited access lessor are considered part of taxable gross income.



(b)   Gross income from rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible
personal property must include all charges by the lessor to the lessee for
repair, maintenance, or other service upon the tangible personal property
rented, leased, or licensed.



(c)   Sale of a warranty, maintenance, or service contract as a
requirement of, or in conjunction with, a rental, leasing, or licensing
contract is exempt.



Reg. 3.07-450.3.  Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of equipment with
operator.



In cases where the tangible personal property is rented, leased, or licensed
with an operator provided by the lessor, the charge for the operator shall
not be includable in the gross income from the rental, lease, or license of
such tangible personal property if the charge for the operator and the charge
for the use of the equipment are separately itemized to the lessee and
separately maintained on the books and records of the lessor.



Reg. 3.07-450.4.  Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible
personal property:  semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible
personal property.



(a)   The term "semi-permanently or permanently installed" means that the
item of tangible personal property has and is expected to have at the time of
installation a permanent location at the site installed, as under a long-term
lease agreement, except that the person using or applying said property may
eventually replace it because it has become worn out or has become obsolete
or the person ceases to have the right to possession of said property.



(b)   An item of tangible personal property is deemed permanently
installed if its installation requires alterations to the premises.



(c)   Examples of "semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible
personal property" include, but are not limited to:  computers, duplicating
machines, furniture not of portable design, major appliances, and store
fixtures.



(d)   The term does not include mobile transportation equipment or
tangible personal property designed for regular use at different locations or
customarily used at different locations, as under numerous short-term rental,
lease, or license agreements, whether or not such property is in fact so used.



   (1)   For example, use of a mobile crane, trencher, automobile, or
other similar equipment shall be considered a rental, lease, or license
transaction subject to taxation only by the city or town in which such
business office of the lessor is based.



   (2)   Other similar examples include, but are not limited to: 
camping equipment, contracting equipment, chain saw, forklift, household
items, invalid needs, janitorial equipment, reducing equipment, furniture of

(e)   A rental, lease, or license agreement which specifies that the item
in question shall remain, under the terms of the agreement, located within
the same city or town for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days
shall be sufficient evidence that such rented, leased, or licensed item is
"permanently or semi-permanently installed" in said city or town, except when
the item is mobile transportation equipment or one of the other types of
portable equipment or property described in subsection (d) above.



Reg. 3.07-450.5 Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal
property:  delivery, installation, repair, and maintenance charges.



(a)   Delivery and installation charges in connection with the rental,

imposed by Section 3.04-450; provided that the provisions ofRegulation
3.07-100.2 have been met.



(b)   Gross income from the sale of a warranty, maintenance, or similar
service contract in connection with the rental, leasing, and licensing of
tangible personal property shall be exempt.



(c)   Separately stated charges for repair not included as part of a
warranty, maintenance, or similar service contract relating to the rental,
leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax
imposed by Section 3.04-450; however, such income is subject to the
provisions of Sections 3.04-460 and 3.04-465, and the provisions ofRegulation
3.07-465.1.



Reg. 3.07-455.1.  Gratuities related to restaurant activity.

provided the customer, and such amounts are maintained separately in the
books and records of the taxpayer; and



   (2)   Such gratuities are distributed in total to employees of the
taxpayer in addition to customary and regular wages.



Reg. 3.07-460.1.  Distinction between retail sales and certain other
transfers of tangible personal property.



(a)   Charges for transfer of tangible personal property included in the
gross income of the business activity of persons engaged in the following
business activities shall be deemed only as gross income from such business
activity and not sales at retail taxed by Section 3.04-460:



   (1)   Tangible personal property incorporated into real property as
part of reconstruction or construction contracting, per Sections 3.04-415

   (2)   (Reserved)



   (3)   Job printing, per Section 3.04-425.

(b)   Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain
direct customer service activities.



   (1)   When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is
a construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or
replacement of that item is construction contracting.



   (2)   Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are
retail sales.



   (3)   Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached
or installed are considered direct customer service activities (for
example:  carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscape maintenance).



   (4)   Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are
considered construction contracting.



(c)   The sale of sand, rock, and gravel extracted from the ground shall
be deemed a sale of tangible personal property and not mining or
metallurgical activity.



(d)   Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real
property is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. 
Examples of consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air
conditioning coolant, but not paint.



(e)   Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has
independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.



   (1)   "Tangible personal property which has independent functional
utility" must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without
attachment to real property.  "Attachment to real property" must include
more than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.



   (2)   Examples of tangible personal property which has independent
functional utility include artwork, furnishings, "plug-in" kitchen equipment,
or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.

Reg. 3.07-460.2.  Retail sales:  trading stamp company transactions.



A trading stamp transaction is defined as follows:  the trading stamp
company issues stamps to a vendor; the vendor then provides them to its
customers; and the customer then exchanges the stamps for merchandise from
the trading stamp company.



The exchange transaction for the merchandise shall be deemed a retail sale
and the trading stamp company a retailer.  All taxes imposed by this Chapter
applicable to retail transactions are therefore applicable to such exchange
transactions.



The rate of tax shall be the retail rate based upon the retail dollar value
of the redeemed merchandise as expressed in the redemption dollar value per
book of stamps or portion thereof.  The tax imposition described herein is
in lieu of any Privilege or Use Tax upon the business of issuing stamps,
redeeming the same, or using or storing property redeemed.



Reg. 3.07-460.3.  Retail sales:  membership fees of retailers.



Membership, admission, or other fees charged by limited access retailers are
considered part of taxable gross income of the business activity of selling
tangible personal property.



Reg. 3.07-460.4.  Retail sales:  professional services.



(a)   "Professional Services" refer to services rendered by such persons
as doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, etc. for their customers or
clients where the services meet particular needs of a specific client and
only apply in the factual context of the client and the final product has no
retail value in itself.  For example, opinion letters, workpapers, reports,
etc. are not in a form which would be subject to retail sales to customers. 
However, transfer of items in a form which would be subject to retail sales
(e.g., artwork, forms, manuals, etc.) would not be considered professional
services.  The issue is one of fact which must be resolved in each situation.



(b)   Creative ("idea") labor and design labor that do not result in
tangible personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed
professional services and, if charged separately and maintained separately in
the taxpayer's books and records, are not includable in gross income.



(c)   "Professional services" shall be deemed to include those items of
tangible personal property which are incidental to the services rendered,
provided such tangible personal property is "inconsequential".



   (1)   Incidental transfers of tangible personal property shall be
regarded as "inconsequential" if,



      (A)   The purchase price of the tangible personal property to
the person rendering the professional services represents less than fifteen
percent (15%) of the charge, billing, or statement rendered to the purchaser
in connection with the transaction, and



      (B)   The tangible personal property transferred is not itself
in a form which is subject to retail sale.



   (2)   In cases where the tangible personal property transferred is
deemed inconsequential, the provider of the tangible personal property so
transferred is deemed the ultimate consumer of such tangible personal
property, and subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter upon
such transfer.



(d)   Examples:



   (1)   The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of
the services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is
regarded as inconsequential to the charges for professional services.



   (2)   An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such
appraiser's efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential.



   (3)   Use of a hair care product on a client's hair by a barber or
beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually
inconsequential.  On the other hand, if the barber or beautician supplies
the customer with a bottle of the product for the client's use thereafter and
without the professional's assistance, the transfer of the bottle of hair
care product is deemed not inconsequential.



   (4)   If a mortician properly segregates his professional services
from other taxable activities on his bill (invoice, contract), his gross
income would include only the income derived from the sale of tangible
personal property (casket, cards, flowers, etc.) and rental, leasing, or
licensing of real and tangible personal property.  His charges for
professional services (embalming, cosmetic work, etc.) would not be
includable in gross income.



Reg. 3.07-460.5.  Retail sales:  monetized bullion; numismatic value of
coins.



(a)   "Monetized Bullion" means coins or other forms of money manufactured
or minted from precious metals or other metals and issued as legal tender or
a medium of exchange by or for any government authorized to do so.



(b)   Any coin shall be considered to have been transferred or acquired
primarily for its "Numismatic value" if the sale or acquisition price:



   (1)   Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) the value of the
metallic content of the coin as of the date of transfer or acquisition; and



   (2)   Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) its face value, in
the case of a coin which, at the time of transfer or acquisition, was legal
tender or a medium of exchange of the government issuing or authorizing its
issuance.



Reg. 3.07-460.6.  Retail sales:  consignment sales.



Sales of merchandise acquired on consignment are taxable as retail sales. 
In cases where the merchant is acting as an agent on behalf of another
dealer, sales of the consigned merchandise are taxable to the principal,
provided the merchant makes full disclosure to customers that he is acting
only as an agent for the named principal.  However, when the principal is
not deemed to be a dealer, such sales are considered to be those of the
merchant and are taxable to him.



Reg. 3.07-465.1.  Retail sales:  repair services.



(a)   Fair market value of parts and labor charges.  The Tax Collector
may examine the reporting of all transactions covered by this Section to
determine if an "arms-length" price is charged for the parts and materials. 
The applicable tax may not be avoided by pricing a part, which ordinarily
sells to the customer at $10, at $5 and including the difference as "service"
or "labor".  In the absence of satisfactory evidence supplied by the
taxpayer as to industry or business practice, the Tax Collector may use the
cost of the part or materials to the taxpayer marked up by a reasonable
profit, to estimate the gross income subject to tax.



(b)   (Reserved)



Reg. 3.07-465.2.  Retail sales:  warranty, maintenance, and similar service
contracts.



(a)   Gross income from sales of warranty, maintenance, and service
contracts is exempt from the tax imposed by Section 3.04-460.



(b)   Transfers of tangible personal property in connection with a
service, warranty, guaranty, or maintenance agreement between a vendor and a
vendee shall be subject to tax under Section 3.04-460 only to the extent of
gross income received from separately itemized charges made for the items of
property transferred.



(c)   The gross income derived from a maintenance insurance agreement,
which agreement is entered into between the purchaser and any person other
than the seller is not subject to tax imposed by Section 3.04-460.  If the
provider of the maintenance insurance agreement pays for tangible personal
property on behalf of the insured in the performance of the agreement, such
sales are subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter.



(d)   Charges for tangible personal property provided under the terms of a
warranty, maintenance, or service contract exempted under Section 3.04-465
are subject to tax as retail sales.



(e)   However, gross income received by a dealer from a manufacturer for
work performed under a manufacturer's warranty is not taxable under Section
3.04-460.



Reg. 3.07-465.3.  Retail sales:  sale of containers, paper products, and
labels.



(a)   The sale of a container or similar packaging material which contains
personal property and which is transferred to the customer with the sale of
the product is not taxable as a sale for resale.  Examples of such
nontaxable containers include but are not limited to:



   (1)   Packaging materials sold to a manufacturer of video equipment
for containment of the product during shipment.



   (2)   Cellophane-type wrap sold to a meat department or butcher for
containment of the individually wrapped or contained meat.



   (3)   Bags used to contain loose fungible goods such as fruits,
vegetables, and other products sold in bulk, where such bags or containers
are used to contain and measure the amount purchased by the customer.



   (4)   Shopping bags and similar merchandising bags sold to grocery
stores, department stores or other retailers.



   (5)   Gift wrappings and gift boxes sold to department stores or
other retailers.



(b)   Sales of non-returnable or disposable paper (and similar products
such as plastic or styrofoam) cups, lids, plates, bags, napkins, straws,
knives, forks and other similar food accessories to a restaurant or others
taxable under Section 3.04-455 for transfer by the restaurant to its customer
to contain or facilitate the consumption of the food, drink or condiment are
sales for resale and not taxable.



(c)   Where a retailer imposes a charge for gift wrapping and the charge
includes the container, paper, and other appropriate materials, the wrapping
charge shall be considered a sale.



(d)   Charges for returnable containers, where the charges are imposed on
the customer, are subject to tax at the time of the transaction.  A credit
may be taken for the amount of refund after such refund is made.



(e)   The sale of labels to a purchaser who affixes them to a primary
container is a sale for resale and not taxable.  Directional or
instructional material included with products sold are considered to be part
of the product and a sale for resale.  However, the sale of items such as
price tags, shipping tags, and advertising matter delivered to the customer
in connection with the retail sale is taxable to the retailer as a retail
sale to it, and is not exempt as a sale for resale.



Reg. 3.07-465.4.  Retail sales:  aircraft acquired for use outside the
State.



"Aircraft acquired for use outside the State" means aircraft, navigational
and communication instruments, and other accessories and related equipment
sold to:



(a)   Any foreign government for use by such government outside of this
state.



(b)   Persons who are not residents of this State and who will not use
such property in this State other than in removing such property from this
State.  This subsection also applies to corporations that are not
incorporated in this State, regardless of maintaining a place of business in
this State, if the principal corporate office is located outside this State
and the property will not be used in this State other than in removing the
property from this State.



Reg. 3.07-470.1.  Telecommunication services.



(a)   Gross income from the business activity of providing
telecommunication services to consumers within this City shall not include:



   (1)   Charges for installation, maintenance, and repair of
telecommunication equipment which are subject to the provisions of Sections
3.04-415, 3.04-416, or 3.04-417 (construction contracting); 3.04-445 (real

mobile in nature (for example, mobile telephones, portable hand-held two-way

tax imposed by this Section, determine whether such provider's customers are
"within this City" as follows:



   (1)   By the billing address of the customer, provided that such
address is a permanent residence or business location of the consumer within
the State.



   (2)   In all other cases, the business location of the
telecommunications provider.



Reg. 3.07-475.1.  Distinction between transporting for hire and certain
related activities.



The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes, airplanes, limousines, etc.) is
deemed rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible personal property
whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly rate.  By comparison, the
activity of a common carrier conveying goods or persons for a fee based upon
distance, and not time, shall be considered transporting for hire.



Reg. 3.07-520.1.  (Reserved)



Reg. 3.07-520.2.  Change of method of reporting.



(a)   Any taxpayer electing to change his reporting method shall be
permitted to do so only upon filing a written request to the Tax Collector
and after receiving written approval of the Tax Collector.  The approval
shall state the effective date of the change.



(b)   The Tax Collector may postpone such approval to allow for
examination of the records of the taxpayer and may further require that all
tax liability be satisfied up to the effective date of the change.



(c)   Failure of the taxpayer to notify the Tax Collector and await
approval before changing the method of reporting will subject the taxpayer to
interest and penalties if his original method of reporting would produce
higher taxes due the City.  When a person makes such change without the
consent of the Tax Collector, the Tax Collector may audit his books and
records to verify the tax liability as of the date of the change.



(d)   Any taxpayer who has failed to indicate a choice of reporting method
upon the application for a Privilege License shall be deemed to have chosen
the accrual method of reporting.

records without good reason or cause may, in the exercise of judicial
discretion by a court, be held to constitute a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies.

CHAPTER 3.30:  EMPLOYMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS



Section



   3.30.010   Purpose and legislative findings.



   3.30.020   Definitions.



   3.30.030   Compliance.



   3.30.040   Proof of verification of employment eligibility.



   3.30.050   Compliance with applicable federal law sufficient to
establish compliance with the requirements of city ordinance.



   3.30.060   Non-compliance.



   3.30.070   Penalties.



§ 3.30.010  PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.



   A.   The City Council hereby finds that there has been an ongoing
national debate regarding the inherent inequities which exist between
employers that comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations
in connection with the hiring of their employees and employers that fail to
comply with those laws and regulations.



   B.   The City Council further finds and determines that these
inequities result in a financial disadvantage for those employers who comply
with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations in the
hiring of their employees while reciprocally providing an unfair financial
advantage to those employers who did not comply with the law.



   C.   The City Council also finds and determines that employer
noncompliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations that
regulate the hiring of employees results in diminished protections of
employees from unfair labor practices and fosters the circumvention of
minimum wage, prevailing wage, and health insurance coverage requirements.



   D.   Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide a means of
facilitating and encouraging compliance with federal law including, but not
limited by enumeration to, the Simpson-Mazoli Act, also known as the
Immigration and Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) appearing at 8 U.S.C.
1101, et seq., by requiring businesses to verify that their employees are
legally eligible to be employed in the United States, and establishing an
enforcement mechanism at the municipal level against non-compliant
businesses, which the City Council finds will:



      1.   Help to promote the federal policy of requiring employers
to verify the employment status of potential employees;



      2.   Help to eliminate unfair competitive advantages between
businesses;



      3.   Help to eliminate unfair labor practices and the
exploitation of workers;



      4.   Help to assure taxpayers that employers and employees are
paying their fair share of taxes by complying with tax laws.



(Ord. 12-1086, § 10, passed 10-23-2012)

this chapter against any person found to be violating the same.

conduct business by a person other than to whom it is issued, with or without
the licensee’s permission, unless the person to whom it was issued is on
the same premises, and in immediate proximity to the person using the
license, and indicates that the person using the license is his or her
employee as defined by Internal Revenue Service Tax Code or Regulations.

upon request of the owner or owner’s agent based on site-specific
circumstances for the purpose of allowing reasonable accommodation of a
vacation rental. All requests must be in writing and shall identify how the
strict application of the standard conditions creates an unreasonable
hardship to a property such that, if the requirement is not modified,
reasonable use of the property for a vacation rental would not be allowed.

   A.   Within the LHIDD: Prior to a lot split or final subdivision
approval for any single or multi-family unit to be developed on parcels or
lots in excess of the number of units permitted under zoning regulations
applicable to the parcel or lot, a water service letter must be obtained or
an additional water supply must be acquired for the water service area along
with a duly executed water delivery contract with either the city or
Reclamation to provide for the delivery of an assured 100-year water supply
for the use to and within the water service area. 



   B.   Outside the LHIDD: The requirements in § 7.08.010A apply for
approval of building permits, lot splits, or final subdivision plats creating
parcels for residential or non-residential developments.



(Ord. 12-1088, § 2, passed 12-11-2012; Ord. 97-519, § 2, passed - -1997;
Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.08.020  WATER SERVICE LETTER APPLICATION.



   The city shall process water service letter applications on a first
come, first served basis in conjunction with building permit, lot split,
and/or subdivision plat applications predicated upon the actual date and time
that the application is accepted as complete by the city.  Receipt of an
application form and materials by the city does not constitute acceptance. 
If the form and materials received are determined to be complete, the date
and time of receipt by the city will establish its priority.  If the form or
materials are determined to be incomplete, then the date and time of the
receipt by the city of the missing information and/or materials, which then
comprise a complete application, will establish its priority.



(Ord. 12-1088, § 3, passed 12-11-2012; Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.08.030  ISSUANCE OF WATER SERVICE LETTERS.



   A.   No water service letters as required by § 7.08.040 shall be
issued unless there is sufficient water budgeted for such uses pursuant to §
7.08.040 hereof, and provided further that budgeted water has not already
been committed pursuant to this chapter.  Each water service letter shall
state an allocation quantity of water available for the new or expanded use
for which it is issued.  Should this assigned allocation be subsequently
exceeded due to an unauthorized expansion, addition, or alteration to a
property, the city may terminate service to the property in whole or in part
after proper notice and hearing.



   B.   Water service letters will be issued by the city for applicable
developments in conjunction with the issuance of building permits, approval
of lot splits, and upon recording of a final subdivision plat with Mohave
County and the submittal of a guarantee of performance in an amount specified
in Chapter 13.20 of the Lake Havasu City Code.



   C.   Validity of water service letters. Water service letters issued
by the city pursuant to this chapter are subject to the following conditions:



      1.   Building permits. In order for a water service letter to
remain valid when issued in conjunction with a building permit, the applicant
must have been issued a building permit and must have begun construction
prior to the expiration of the building permit, which will be 180 days from
the date of permit issuance. Commencement of construction will be evidenced
by an inspection and certification by the city.  Failure to commence
construction by the expiration of the building permit will cause the water
service letter to expire.  If the building permit is revoked or canceled for
any reason, then the water service letter also is voided.



      2.   Lot splits and final subdivision plats. A water service
letter issued in conjunction with approval of a lot split or upon recording
of a final subdivision plat with Mohave County and the submittal of a
guarantee of performance in an amount specified in Chapter 13.20 of the Lake
Havasu City Code shall remain valid as long as the newly created lots are
recorded and construction has commenced pursuant to building permits for at
least 10% of the recorded lots within one year, 30% within the third year,
and 50% within 5 years from the date of the recordation.  Should the lots
ever become abandoned, the water service letter is also thereby voided. 
Except that buildings allowed under a duly issued building permit and issued
a certificate of occupancy shall be granted a water allocation in an amount
sufficient to allow the continued occupancy of the structure.  Any
expansions or modifications to the structure or the use requiring additional
water shall require the issuance of a new water service letter.



(Ord. 12-1088, § 4, passed 12-11-2012; Ord. 97-519, § 3, passed - -1997;
Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.08.040  WATER BUDGET.



   A.   Under existing and proposed water service contracts, a total
water supply of 28,331.7 acre-feet per annum is available to the city for use
within its water service area.  However, 2,139 acre-feet of this amount, as
stipulated in the current subcontract through the Mohave County Water
Authority, may only be utilized under normal Colorado River supply conditions
when the projected annual water demand exceeds the rest of the city's
entitlement (currently 26,192.7 acre-feet).  Water demands up to 26,192.7
acre-feet during normal supply conditions will be budgeted by the city in the
following way:



      1.   For all existing and future municipal water uses within
the LHIDD: 16,000 acre-feet.



      2.   For water service pursuant to contract with Horizon Six
Improvement District, Sunset Mobile Home Park and Anasazi Pueblo,
Incorporated: 331 acre-feet.



      3.   For dedication of evaporative losses of the English
Village marina: 12.7 acre-feet.



      4.   For all existing and future municipal water service
outside the LHIDD: 9,849 acre-feet.



   B.   When demand of the above volumes has been collectively met, up
to 2,139 acre-feet of additional Colorado River water allocation becomes
available for water service anywhere within the city's entire water service
area.



   C.   The establishment of this water budget is intended to account
for all annual consumptive uses of Colorado River water allocated to the
city, in concert with Reclamation contract provisions. The water budget set
forth in § 7.08.040A hereof may be adjusted periodically in response to
changing water demands, water supply availability (including federally
declared Colorado River water shortages) and subsequent implementation of
water conservation measures set forth in § 7.12.010, § 7.20.020 hereof and
in the city's Water Conservation Plan to make maximum use of its water
supply.  The water budget does not constitute a guarantee of availability of
water for new uses.



   D.   The receipt or withdrawal by any person or entity of any
Colorado River water allocated to the city is conditioned upon payment to the
city of any applicable fees or charges and compliance with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the measures set
forth in this water allocation and management program.

96-500, § 1, passed - -1996; Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.08.050  COOPERATION WITH LAKE HAVASU IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE DISTRICT.



   The city will continue to cooperatively manage water supply, delivery
and management with the LHIDD for service to residents within the LHIDD
pursuant to the water budget set forth in § 7.08.040(A) hereof.



(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.08.060  WELL REGULATION.



   A.   The city finds as follows:



      1.   Lake Havasu City is a party to Contract #3-07-30-W0039
with Reclamation for the delivery of Colorado River water.



      2.   Reclamation has asserted a claim that all groundwater
above the accounting surface in the Colorado River Valley west of the Mohave
Mountains is hydrologically connected to the surface flow of the Colorado
River.



      3.   Reclamation requires, as a condition of the water
delivery contract, that any groundwater withdrawn below the accounting
surface within the water service area be deducted from the city's contract
entitlement to Colorado River water and further, that a failure to report
total diversion of Colorado River water to the Regional Director of
Reclamation constitutes grounds for termination of the contract.



      4.   The city, in order to protect its contract entitlement
and to provide adequate service within its water service area, must adopt the
following measures applicable to all well drilling and withdrawal of
groundwater within the water service area.



      5.   The city reserves the right to contest Reclamation's
claim regarding what water is connected to the surface flow of the Colorado
River.



   B.   Any owner of an existing water-producing well located inside
the water service area shall register the well upon a form provided by the
city which shall require the following information: description of the well
location; the Arizona well registration number; a copy of the notice of
completion filed with the Arizona Department of Water Resources; the maximum
discharge volume (gallons per minute) of the well; and on the fifteenth day
of each month, a full written report of volume of water diverted. 



   C.   Except as specified in § 7.08.060D, no water-producing well
shall be drilled or existing well modified within the water service area, and
no water shall be withdrawn from such a new or modified well.



   D.   A temporary water producing well solely for construction
operations may be drilled only after securing a determination from
Reclamation through consultation with the city of the water table surface
elevation at the location of the proposed well site and an approved permit
from the city that considers the impact of the proposed withdrawal upon both
water quality and quantity on the city's water system; compatibility with
city planning, zoning, and resource allocation codes, regulations, and
policies; and any subsidence effect upon any neighboring property or any
other properties subject to the cone of influence.  Permit validation length
will be determined on a case by case basis, but in no case shall such
determination exceed 120 days from date of submission.  At the end of the
permit period, the responsible permitted party shall abandon the well within
30 days in accord with Arizona Department of Water Resources well abandonment
regulations.



   E.   Any permit issued pursuant to this section may stipulate that:



      1.   The permit is nontransferable without permission from the
city.



      2.   The well shall be limited to a specified pump capacity
and all diverted water metered as outlined in the permit.



      3.   The well shall not be used for any purpose other than
that listed and approved in the permit.



      4.   The well's location and rate of withdrawal may not be
materially altered without prior city approval and amendment of the permit. 
In determining whether to issue such an amendment, the city shall consider
the factors set forth in § 7.08.060D hereof and such other factors as are
appropriate.



      5.   The owner shall agree in writing to all water
conservation and erosion protection measures which may be imposed by the city.



      6.   Permits for temporary water use which are due to expire
may only be extended by the approval of the City Manager upon application
prior to the date of permit expiration.  Temporary uses of water shall be
reviewed on an annual basis to assure compliance with applicable conditions
of issuance.  Permits for the temporary use of water may be revoked by the
City Manager upon a finding of failure to comply with conditions of permit
issuance.

§ 7.12.010  WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.



   All recipients of Colorado River water allocation to and/or delivered
by the city shall abide by such conservation measures as are from time to
time adopted by the city, including but not limited to code of Lake Havasu
(relating to conservation requirements for landscaping features) and
12.08.111 et seq. (relating to low water flow fixtures and devices required
for new buildings and additions to existing buildings) and any amendments or

§ 7.18.010  PENALTIES.



   Pursuant to code of Lake Havasu City § 1.08.010, any person found
guilty of violating any provision of this water allocation and management
program shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall
be punished by a fine of not to exceed $1,000, or by imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 6 months, or by both the fine and imprisonment. Each day
that a violation continues shall be a separate offense punishable as
hereinabove described. In addition, the city may take such other action as
may be appropriate in responding to a violation hereof, including but not
limited to the termination of water service or capping of unauthorized wells.



(Ord. 95-474, §, passed - -1995)



§ 7.18.020  ENFORCEMENT AGREEMENTS.



   A.   Generally. The city shall enforce the provisions of this water
allocation and management program throughout the water service area by all
appropriate means, including but not limited to cooperative enforcement
agreements with federal agencies or the State of Arizona and its political
subdivisions. With respect to the application of this water allocation and
management program within that portion of the water service area located
outside the city's boundaries, the city shall seek adoption of the program by
Mohave County through appropriate means, including but not limited to a
county ordinance or intergovernmental agreement or contract.



   B.   Enforcement outside city limits. Until such time as agreement
is reached with Mohave County concerning application of this water allocation
and management program throughout the water service area, the city will
provide water service outside the city limits only to parties who agree in
writing to comply with the provisions of this water allocation and management
program and water service rules and regulations.



(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995)



§ 7.18.030  OTHER REMEDIES.



   A.   Any use of Colorado River water within the water service area
which is inconsistent with this water allocation and management program will
be considered by the city to be not only a violation of any applicable city,
local or state law, but also an interference with the contractual
relationship between the city and reclamation and a violation of federal law.
If appropriate, the city will seek assistance from county, state and/or
federal officials to halt such unauthorized water use.



   B.   It shall be a civil offense for anyone obtaining water from the
city through an irrigation meter, to use such water for a non-irrigation
purpose. In addition to any civil penalties as imposed by the court pursuant
to a finding of violation, the city may, at the discretion of the City
Manager or his or her designee, refuse to permit the offending party to
utilize irrigation meters at the location of the offense or any other
location.



   C.   Upon finding by the City Manager or his designee, based upon
substantial, reliable, and probative information that an offense has
occurred, the city may take such action as is necessary to prevent further
misuse of irrigation meters by the offending party, including but not limited
to shutting off or removing such meters. The finding and remedial action are
independent of civil prosecution of the offender.



   D.   Administrative review of denial or removal of meters or permits
is available pursuant to § 7.18.040.



(Ord. 95-474, § 1, passed - -1995; Ord. 03-707, passed - -2003)



§ 7.18.040  ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.



   Any person adversely affected by a decision of a city official or
employee pursuant to this chapter may, within 10 business days after receipt
or notice of such a decision, submit the matter to the City Manager or
designee for review.  Review of the matter may be conducted in an informal
manner and without adherence to the rules of evidence required in judicial
proceedings.  The City Manager may hold an informal hearing on the matter. 
The City Manager's decision is final and shall be in writing, contain
findings of fact and other grounds for the final decision, and be delivered
or mailed within 60 days of the submission of the appeal to the party
requesting review and to his or her attorney of record, if any.

(Ord. 10-1004, passed 4-13-2010)



§ 7.20.020  WASTE OF WATER PROHIBITED.



   During federally-declared Colorado River Shortages that result in a
direct reduction to the city's annual allocation, the following activities
may be prohibited as determined by the City Council:



   A.   The expenditure or application of potable water, including from

sidewalk, swale or storm drain in a steady stream or flow.



   B.   Allowing water waste caused by easily correctable leaks,
breaks, or malfunctions.  If the problem is in an irrigation system, the
water supply to the irrigation system must be turned off, if there is a
separate shut-off valve for the irrigation system, after discovery or
notification of such leaks, breaks, or malfunctions until the problem can be
fixed.  If the problem is in the service line leading away from the water
meter or there is no shut-off valve that isolates the irrigation system from
the water line going into a structure (i.e. residential, commercial or
industrial) or the problem is within said structure, the leak, break, or
malfunction must be fixed within 10 business days of discovery or
notification.



   C.   Use of potable water to hose/wash buildings or impervious

meeting all requirements of the ADEQ to each and every lot.  The centralized
collection and treatment system shall be owned and operated by the
subdivider, unless the system is dedicated to and accepted by the city as
provided herein.  When public sewer service is extended to the subdivision,
and notice of availability is given to the subdivider as provided herein, the
wastewater treatment facility shall be decommissioned and the centralized
sewer collection system serving the subdivision shall be connected to the
public sewer.



      4.   Interim provisions. Within the existing platted areas of
the city, as described in the current applicable map located in the City
Clerk's office (Ordinance 02-668, Attachment A) and incorporated by reference
herein, single-family dwellings located on existing single-family residential
property that do not have public sewer available at the time the building
permit is issued shall be allowed to install temporary onsite wastewater
treatment systems in accordance with ADEQ and Mohave County regulations,
provided that the appropriate permits are obtained to do so.  In conjunction
with the installation of the temporary onsite system, the property owner
shall install a dry sewer lateral if so required by the Director for future
connection to the public sewer when it becomes available.  Dry sewer
laterals shall be installed for such work in accordance with the city sewer
design standards and specifications on file in the city engineer's office at
the time either the building permit or plumbing permit is issued, whichever
occurs first. All such properties granted a temporary onsite wastewater
treatment system permit shall connect to the public sewer at such time as it
becomes available, and within 14 days of receipt of written notice from the
city to do so.



      5.   No cesspool, septic tank, seepage pit, drain field,
onsite wastewater treatment system, or onsite denitrifying system shall be

      5.   Decanting, back flushing or discharging of removed wastes
back into the oil and grease interceptor or oil/water separator from which
the waste was removed or any other oil and grease interceptor or oil/water
separator, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled and disposed
is prohibited.



      6.   Pumping frequency shall be determined by the
administrative authority based on flow, volume of business, hours of
operation, seasonal variations and the quantity of substances in the final
compartment as required by the “25% rule” as defined in division 7.  In
no case shall the pumping frequency exceed 180 days unless approved by the
city.



      7.   The “25% Rule” requires that the combined depth in
the final chamber of objectionable substance (floating and settled) in an
interceptor or trap shall not be equal to or greater than 25% of the total
operating depth of the interceptor or trap.  The operating depth of an
interceptor or trap is determined by measuring the internal depth from the
outlet water elevation to the bottom in the last chamber.



      8.   Additives placed into the oil and grease interceptor,
oil/water separator or building discharge line system on a constant, regular
or scheduled basis shall be reported to the administrative authority in
writing at least 10 days prior to use along with the MSDS.  Such additives

      2.   Cleaning and maintenance shall include removal of
materials from the tank walls, baffles, cross pipes, inlets and outlets.



      3.   Mixing of an under-the-sink trap is strictly prohibited.



      4.   Under-the-sink oil and grease traps shall be cleaned at a
minimum frequency of once a month, or more often as necessary to prevent pass
through of grease and other food solids to the collection system.



      5.   When necessary replace or repair baffles, lid gaskets,
inlet and outlet downturns, and any other replaceable or repairable parts so
that the trap operates as designed by the manufacturer.



      6.   Additives placed into the trap on a constant, regular or
scheduled basis shall be reported to the administrative authority in writing
at least 10 days prior to use along with the MSDS.  Such additives shall
include, but not be limited to, emulsifiers, enzymes, commercially available
bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb, purge, consume, treat, or
otherwise eliminate grease and oils.  Any use of additives shall be approved
by the administrative authority prior to introduction into the wastestream,
interceptor, or separator.  The use of additives in no way shall be
considered as a substitution to the maintenance procedures required herein.



   C.   Grease interceptors required.



      1.   All businesses dealing in food preparation of any kind,
such as, but not limited to, restaurants, commissaries, kitchens, and
caterers shall install a minimum 800-gallon approved oil and grease
interceptor in accordance with the International Plumbing Code or Uniform
Plumbing Code which ever is more restrictive.



      2.   If multifamily dwellings, such as townhouses,
condominiums, apartment buildings, apartment complexes or areas of
intensified dwelling, are found by the administrative authority to be
contributing oil and grease in quantities sufficient to cause main line
stoppages, lift station malfunctions, or necessitate increased maintenance on
the collection system, said user(s) shall be directed to cease discharging
oil and grease to the wastewater system and/or shall be required to install a
grease and oil interceptor. A control manhole or inspection box for
monitoring purposes shall be required and installed at the owner/operator's
sole expense, in accordance with the International Plumbing Code or Uniform
Plumbing Code which ever is more restrictive, and 800 gallons is the absolute
minimum size.



      3.   Under-the-sink oil and grease traps are prohibited on new
construction unless approved by the administrative authority.



   D.   Sand and oil interceptors required.

      1.   Existing food service or automotive related facilities
that discharge into the city sewer system, shall be required to install an
approved, properly operated and maintained oil and grease interceptor, grease
trap or oil/water separator approved by the administrative authority when the
following exist:



         a.   If there is no interceptor or trap at this facility
which operates as, or has discharges of liquids or wastes typical of, the
facilities identified in this code for interceptor installation.



         b.   Remodeling of a structure that will be discharging
certain liquids or wastes to the POTW may be prohibited or limited by the
provisions of this chapter.



         c.   The existing pretreatment device is in a state of
disrepair such that it cannot be repaired to achieve continuously efficient
operation.



         d.   The existing pretreatment devise is hydraulically
undersized to receive discharges from the fixtures or equipment requiring
pretreatment.



         e.   The City Council shall, from time to time, by
resolution, establish the maximum quantities of certain substances, which may
be discharged into the sewer system or treatment works operated by the
city.  Discharge into the sewer system or treatment works of any such
substance in a quantity or concentration in excess of that set forth in such
resolution shall constitute a violation of this section.



      2.   Every building must be separately connected with a public
sewer, however, 1 or more buildings located on lots or parcels of land
belonging to the same owner may be served with the same building sewer during
the period of said ownership.  If the property is subdivided and different
ownerships are created, sewer service can be provided by separate connection
of each building to the public sewer, or by an onsite collection system,
which collects sewerage from 2 or more buildings and conveys it to the public
sewer.



         a.   Ownership and maintenance of the onsite collection
system shall remain with the property owner(s), under the authority of a duly
created property owners association, unless prior to approval/construction of
the onsite collection system, formal written request is made to the City
Council to accept the system for ownership and maintenance, the onsite
collection system is designed and constructed in accordance with these
documents and all State and Federal regulations, and the City Council accepts
the system for ownership and maintenance. 



         b.   The property owner shall also grant perpetual
unencumbered access to all facilities located on said property through the
granting of perpetual easements and/or rights of way of sufficient width, as
determined by the city, to allow full operation, maintenance and repair of
said facilities in the future.  All such easements and/or rights of way
shall be recorded with the county before being considered valid. 



         c.   Ownership and maintenance of the onsite collection
system by the city will not become effective until all construction has been
completed, the property owner's professional engineer has submitted all
required drawings, electronic files, test results, certification of
completion and other documents determined by the Department, the property
owner has submitted adequate proof of the required access easements and/or 
rights of way necessary for perpetual access to the facilities and the city
has issued a letter indicating that the work has been done in accordance with
these regulations.

      14.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitutes a hazard to
humans or animals, creates a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the
POTW, or to exceed the limitation of similar paper products, either whole or
ground, or to exceed the limitation set forth in the categorical pretreatment
standard.  A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any
pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act;



      15.   Any discharge which will cause interference with POTW
operations, reuse, AZPDES permit, Aquifer Protection permit or the water
quality standards for receiving water;



      16.   Any waste having a temperature of 120° F or higher at
the discharge point, or which causes the treatment works influent to exceed
104° F;



      17.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products
of mineral origin in amounts that cause pass through or interference;



      18.   Any discharge which the Director determines is
inconsistent with the rules, regulations and ordinances promulgated by the
City Council. 



   C.   Hospitals, clinics, offices of medical doctors, and
convalescent homes, shall not discharge to the sewer by any means:



      1.   Disposable hypodermic needles, syringes and associated
articles.



      2.   Infectious wastes defined as:



         a.   Laboratory and surgical room wastes.



         b.   Wastes from outpatient areas and emergency rooms
similar to those included above.



         c.   Equipment, instruments, utensils and other
materials of a disposable nature that may harbor or transmit pathogenic
organisms and that are used in the rooms of patients having a suspected or
diagnosed communicable disease which by the nature of the disease is required
to be isolated by public health agencies.



      3.   Solid wastes generated in the rooms of patients who are
isolated because of a suspected or diagnosed communicable disease.



      4.   All solid wastes not included in A. above.



   D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
authority of the Health Officer of the county to define wastes as being
infectious and, with the concurrence of the Director, to prohibit their
discharge to the sewer.



   E.   The department reserves the right to inspect any existing
lateral or collecting sewers that discharge wastewater directly or indirectly
to trunk sewers.



      1.   If it is found that such lateral or collecting sewers are
improperly used or improperly maintained, thereby causing discharge of
wastewater, excessive groundwater, debris or any other objectionable
substance to the city sewers, the department will give notice of the
unsatisfactory condition to the offending discharger and shall direct the
condition be corrected.



      2.   In cases of continued noncompliance with the department
directive, the department may disconnect the offending user from city sewer
system and/or water supply.

§ 8.05.070  DISCHARGE PERMITS.



   A.   General. This section prescribes procedural and substantive
rules governing the city's industrial waste program promulgated to protect
the city's collection and treatment works, and to provide a method of
controlling industrial discharges to the system.



   B.   Prohibition of discharges.  Except as authorized by a permit
issued by the department in compliance with the provisions of this section,
it is unlawful for any person to discharge any industrial waste into any
portion of the city's sewage collection system.



   C.   Application and procedure.



      1.   Any person discharging industrial wastewater shall file a
complete application not later than 60 days following receipt of notice from
the Director to submit such application.



      2.   Any person wishing to commence future discharges of
industrial wastes must file a complete application either:



         a.   Not less than 90 days in advance of the date on
which it is desired to commence the discharge; or



         b.   In sufficient time prior to the commencement of the
discharge to insure compliance with this section.



         c.   The Director may require the submission of
additional information after a permit application has been filed.



      3.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secret of the user.



         a.   To claim his trade secret protection, the user must
specify at the time of submitting his reports or information, that part he
desires to protect.



         b.   When requested by the person furnishing a report,
the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall
be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this section, the Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(AZPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment
programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be
available for use by the city, the state or any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.



   D.   Signature requirements.



      1.   Application and reporting forms submitted to the
department shall be signed as follows:



         a.   Corporations: by a principal executive officer (of
at least the level of vice president) or his duly authorized representative
who is responsible for the overall operation of the facility from which the
discharge described in the application or reporting form originates;



         b.   Partnership: by a general partner;



         c.   Sole proprietorship: by the proprietor;



         d.   State or other public facility: by either a
principal executive officer, ranking elected official or other duly
authorized employee.



      2.   Each application must contain a certification by the
person signing the application that he/she is familiar with the information
provided, that to the best of his knowledge and belief such information is
complete and accurate, and that he has the authority to sign and execute the
application.



   E.   Other terms and conditions of issued permits.



      1.   In addition, the terms and conditions of each issued
permit shall provide for and insure the following:



         a.   That all discharges authorized by the permit shall
be consistent with the terms and conditions of the permit; that facility
expansions, change of ownership or location, production increases, or process
modifications which result in new or increased discharges of pollutants must
be reported by submitting a new permit application at least 90 days before
such changes occur or, if such discharge does not violate discharge
limitations specified in the permit, by submission to the Director of a
notice of such new or increased discharge or pollutants at least 90 days
before such changes occur; that the discharge of any pollutant not identified
and authorized by the permit or the discharge of any pollutant more
frequently than or at a level in excess of that identified and authorized by
the permit shall constitute a violation of the terms and conditions of the
permit;



         b.   That the permit may be modified, suspended or
revoked, in whole or in part, during its term for cause including, but not
limited to, the following:



            i.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the
permit;



            ii.   Obtaining a permit by misrepresentation or
failure to disclose fully all relevant facts, or



            iii.   A change in conditions, or the existence of
a condition, which requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or
elimination of the permitted activity;



         c.   That the permittee shall permit the Director and/or
his authorized representative, upon the presentation of his credentials:



            i.   To enter upon the permittee's premises during
normal working hours in which an effluent source is located or in which any
records are required to be kept under terms and conditions of the permit,



            ii.   To have access to and copy any records
required to be kept under terms and conditions of the permit,



            iii.   To inspect any monitoring equipment or
method required in the permit, or



            iv.   To sample and test any discharge;



         d.   That the permittee at all times shall maintain in
good working order and operate as efficiently as possible any facilities or
systems of control installed by the permittee to achieve compliance with the
terms and conditions of the permit;



         e.   Upon the effective date of any federal categorical
pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal
standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter shall
immediately supersede these limitations;



      2.   Notification requirements.



         a.   Notification of accidental discharge, slug loading,
bypass, other noncompliance.



            i.   Immediate.  In the event of bypass, upset,
accidental discharge, spill, or slug load, which may endanger health, the
environment, or the treatment works, the permittee shall notify the Director
by telephone immediately upon discovery of the occurrence.



            ii.   Twenty-four hour reporting.  The permittee
shall report within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the
circumstances, any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit,
or exceedence of a maximum discharge limitation for any of the pollutants
listed in the permit.



            iii.   Contact. Permittee shall contact the
Director or designee during working hours or police department at other
times.  The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.



            iv.   Follow-up.  Within 5 days following
notification, the permittee shall submit to the Director a detailed written
report containing such information and describing the cause of the discharge
and measures to be taken by the permittee to prevent similar future
occurrences.  Such notification shall not relieve the permittee of any
expense, loss, damage, fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the treatment works or any other person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the permittee of any fines,
civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or
other applicable law.



         b.   The permittee shall report all instances of
noncompliance at the time monitoring reports are submitted.  The reports
shall contain the information listed in this section.



         c.   Where the permittee becomes aware that it failed to
submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or submitted incorrect
information in a permit application or in any report to the Director, it
shall promptly submit such facts or information.



      3.   Bypass.



         a.   The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which
does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are
not subject to the provisions of this section.



         b.   If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass.



         c.   The permittee shall submit notice of an
unanticipated bypass as required in this section.



      4.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take
enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, unless:



         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life or
personal injury, or to prevent severe substantial physical property damage,
causing them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of
a bypass.  Severe substantial property damage does not mean economic loss by
delays in production;



         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         c.   The permittee submitted notices as required under
this section.



      5.   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet
the 3 conditions listed in this section.



      6.   Suspension or revocation of a permit or any portion
thereof pursuant to this section shall not be a bar to criminal prosecution
where deemed appropriate by the City Attorney.



   F.   Duration, reissuance and assignment. The duration of the
permits shall be fixed and shall not exceed 5 years.  The expiration date
shall be recorded on each permit issued.  A new application must be filed
with the department to obtain renewal or modification of a permit. 
Applications for renewal shall be filed at least 90 days prior to expiration
of the permit.  No permit shall be assigned or transferred without first
obtaining the written permission of the Director.  Fees shall be assessed
pursuant to Chapter 3.20.



   G.   Monitoring, recording and reporting of discharges.



      1.   The department may, by order or permit, require the owner
or operator of any source of a discharge to:



         a.   Establish and maintain such records;



         b.   Make such reports;



         c.   Install, calibrate, use and maintain such
monitoring equipment or methods, including, where appropriate, biological
monitoring methods;



         d.   Provide such other information relating to
discharges as the Director prescribes or as is necessary to determine the
existence, nature and frequency of any discharges.



      2.   The cost of all testing and sampling as may be required
by the department shall be provided and paid for by the discharger.



   H.   Issuance, reapplication, modification, suspension and
revocation.



      1.   The Director may, after notice and opportunity for a
hearing, modify, suspend or revoke any permit, in whole or in part, during
its term for cause or for failure or refusal of the permittee to carry out
the requirements of this chapter.



      2.   The Director may, upon request of the permittee, revise
or modify a schedule of compliance in an issued permit if he determines good
and valid cause (such as an act of God, strike, flood, materials shortage or
other event over which the permittee has little or no control) exists for
such revision.



      3.   Permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit prior to
the expiration date of current permit.  The application must be submitted to
the department at least 90 calendar days before the expiration date of the
current permit, unless written permission for an extension of the time is
timely requested and the Department grants the extension.



      4.   Subject to the Director's right to modify, revoke or
terminate the current permit, it shall continue to remain in full force and
effect after the date of expiration if the permittee has applied for a new
permit in accordance with the time frame required by this section, and a new
permit has not been issued prior to the expiration date of the current permit.



(Ord. 13-1090, § 9, passed 3-12-2013; Ord. 932, passed 8-26-2008)



§ 8.05.080  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER SAMPLING, ANALYSIS AND FLOW MEASUREMENTS.



   A.   All wastewater analysis shall be conducted in accordance with
the methods promulgated under Section 304(g) of the Act or 40 CFR 136.  If
no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the
industry or a procedure judged satisfactory by the department shall be used
to measure wastewater constituents.  Any independent laboratory or
discharger performing tests shall furnish any required test data or
information on the test methods or equipment used if requested to do so by
the department.



   B.   All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and
install in a monitoring and sampling vault or other approved location a
calibrated flume, weir, flow meter or similar device approved by the
department and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater and total
volume.  A flow indicating, recording and totalizing register shall be
required by the department.  The discharger shall install and maintain
facilities to allow inspection and monitoring of the wastewater.  The flow
measuring facility shall meet the requirements of city sewer system design.



   C.   The sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures,
equipment and results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the
department.  Sampling and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to
provide safe access to authorized personnel.



   D.   When required by the Director, the owner of any property served
by a building sewer carrying potentially harmful or industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, measurement and sampling of the wastes.  Such manhole, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in
accordance with plans approved by the Director.  The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to
be safe and accessible at all times.



(Ord. 932, passed 8-26-2008)



§ 8.05.090  DISCHARGES.



   A.   The City Council shall, from time to time, by resolution,
establish the maximum quantities of certain substances which may be
discharged into the sewer system or treatment works operated by the
department.



   B.   Discharge into the sewer system or treatment works of any such
substance in a quantity or concentration in excess of that set forth in such
resolution shall constitute a violation of this section.



   C.   An industrial wastewater treatment surcharge shall be paid to
the city on a monthly basis by those industrial wastewater dischargers whose
contribution of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids create
costs in excess of the value of their sewer service charges.  The individual
waste discharge shall be considered as creating cost in excess of the value
of their sewer service charges when the concentration of BOD and SS exceed
the following:



               BOD   --   275 mg/L



               SS   --   200 mg/L



   D.   The treatment surcharge shall be based on the appropriate city
sewerage system's total maintenance, operation and capital expenditures for
providing industrial wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services
as described in § 8.05.120.  The annual industrial wastewater treatment
surcharge shall be computed by the following formula:



         Rate per 1000 gallons of water consumption =



         {RFLOW+[(RBOD)(CBOD)(8.34)]/1000 +
[(RSS)(CSS)(8.34)]/1000}/1000(Z)



   Where:



      RFLOW   =   Unit costs associated with wastewater flow per
million gallons per year.



      RBOD   =   Unit costs associated with BOD per 1000 pounds
per year.



      RSS   =   Unit costs associated with SS per 1000 pounds per
year.



      CBOD   =   BOD concentration in mg/l over 275 mg/L.



      CSS   =   SS concentration in mg/l over 200 mg/L.



      Z   =   The estimated ratio between wastewater flow and
water consumption.



   E.   The quantity for total flow shall be the quantity of water
measured at the water meter.  Where no meter exists, the surcharge will be
calculated based on 950 gallons per month per fixture unit.



   F.   The quantities for BOD and suspended solids for certain classes
of users shall be based on typical strengths as listed herein:



 



 

BOD (ppm)

 

Suspended Solids (ppm)

§ 8.05.100  ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIT CHARGE RATES FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER
TREATMENT SURCHARGE.



   A.   Unit charge rates “RFLOW,” “RBOD,” and “RSS” (see
§ 8.05.110) in the industrial wastewater surcharge shall remain unchanged if
no significant changes occur for the sewerage system by the procedure
described herein.



   B.   For the sewerage system, appropriate unit charge rate
parameters for flow, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids,
respectively designated “RFLOW” (in dollars per million gallons per
year), “RBOD” (in dollars per 1,000 pounds per year), and “RSS,” (in
dollars per 1,000 pounds of suspended solids per year), shall be determined
by the following method:



      1.   The total capital outlay for construction of sewerage
facilities, including debt principal and interest, shall be estimated and
distributed among the 3 parameters in accordance with the city's
determination of the percentage of the total existing capital facilities of
the sewerage system predominately related to each parameter.



      2.   The total operation and maintenance costs of the system
shall be distributed among the 3 parameters in accordance with the city's
determination as to which charges are predominately related to each parameter.



      3.   The sum of the capital costs and operation and
maintenance costs determined for each parameter in divisions B.1. and B.2.,
shall be divided by the total volume of wastewater and weight of BOD and
suspended solids to be treated by the sewerage system in order to obtain the
unit charge rates “RFLOW,” “RBOD,” and “RSS,” for the system.



   C.   The city may require industrial users to pay an additional fee,
established pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 3.20, to recover the costs
of administering the industrial pretreatment program.



(Ord. 932, passed 8-26-2008)



§ 8.05.110  VARIANCES.



   A.   In the event that the average waste characteristics and
corresponding surcharge rate is disputed by a permittee, the permittee may be
granted a variance by the Director under certain conditions.  A variance
will be granted if all the following conditions are met:



      1.   The permittee shall apply to the industrial waste
inspector for a variance.  The permittee shall state why a variance is being
requested.



      2.   The permittee, at his expense, shall provide supporting
data as outlined herein or as may be requested by the industrial waste
inspector to show cause why a variance should be granted.



      3.   The permittee shall sample his wastewater to determine
representative 5-day biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids
concentrations.



      4.   Wastewater sampling shall be for at least 3, 24-hour
periods.  The periods shall be representative of the nature of the business
and shall be approved in advance by the industrial waste inspector.  Samples
shall be made up of a 24-hour composite.  The sampler shall have the
capability to clear the tubing prior to drawing a sample into the sampling
container, either manually or by automatic sampling equipment, with at least
1 sample collected hourly or by automatic integrated sampling equipment
approved by the industrial waste inspector.



      5.   The sampling point shall be approved by the industrial
waste inspector.  If no sampling point exists, the permittee shall construct
such at his expense.



      6.   The analysis shall be performed by a laboratory approved
by the state.



      7.   The handling, storage and analysis of all samples shall
be in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for
Examination of Water and Wastewater,” as published by the American Public
Health Association, American Water Works Association, and Water Environment
Federation and 40 CFR 136, as applicable.



      8.   Based on the analysis, a variance will be permitted if
the resulting surcharge rate calculated by the industrial waste inspector
would result in charges fifteen percent less than those using rates adopted
by the City Council.



   B.   The permittee shall continue to demonstrate that a variance is
justified by performing the above analysis once every 3 years or when any
modifications are done to the structure requiring a building permit.



(Ord. 932, passed 8-26-2008)



§ 8.05.120  RATES AND FEES.



   A.   User charges and fees.  All properties receiving sewer
service, whether in or outside the city, shall be required to pay all sewer
rates, user charges, fees, and capacity or development  fees as adopted from
time to time by the City Council, pursuant to Chapter 3.20.  Properties
outside the city limits shall also be required to pay any additional fees as
set forth in their Wastewater Service Agreement; in no event shall sewer
service be provided to properties outside the City limits at rates and fees
less than those inside the city.  The City Council, pursuant to Chapter
3.20, is hereby authorized to impose a user charge system for the calculation
of sewer user charges.  These charges shall be revised on a regular basis
consistent with the adopted sewer user charge system per Chapter 3.20. 
Sewer user charges shall apply to all property/facilities connected to the
sewer. For those properties located within the ban areas as defined in §
8.05.040, sewer user charges shall be due upon connection to sewer.



   B.   Minimum monthly charges.  In order to protect the investment
made by the city to serve all customers, regardless of water use/sewer flows,
a minimum monthly sewer charge is charged to all sewer system customers as
long as there is active water service to the permises. Sewer system customers
for this purpose are defined as all customers physically connected to the
system. The minimum charge shall be based on the formula adopted pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 3.20 and shall be revised on a regular basis.



   C.   Treatment capacity fees.



      1.   Imposition of a treatment capacity fee.  A treatment
capacity fee is hereby imposed upon all facilities making use of the city
sewer system.  This fee is based upon the projected cost of wastewater
treatment facilities, capacity associated with those facilities and the
number of equivalent residential units to be served by these facilities. 



         a.   This fee shall be reviewed on a regular basis and
be adopted pursuant to the provision of Chapter 3.20.



         b.  For the purposes of determining the treatment capacity
fee all R1 Single Family Residential properties shall be treated as 1 ERU,
regardless of the water meter size.



      2.   Extended payment provisions. Certain customers will be
permitted the option of paying the treatment capacity fee over a 10-year
period at 4% interest.  This financing option is only available to
residential single family and duplex properties in existence at the time
sewer service is first made available to the area through the Wastewater
System Expansion Program and will require the property owner to sign a
Promissory Note and Deed of Trust in favor of the City for the sewer fixtures
being installed thereon. The optional 10-year financing will be made
available only through the 14-day period after notice to connect as set forth
in § 8.05.040.  Otherwise, the full connection fee is due and payable upon
application for connection to the sewer system.



      3.   Payment.  Payment of all fees shall be made for:



         a.   Existing developed properties within the city:



            i.   Upon connection to the system, or



            iii.   Within the 14-day notice period set forth
in § 8.05.040.



         b.   Undeveloped properties within the city limits: no
later than the time of building permit issuance.



         c.   All properties outside the city limits: as set
forth in a wastewater service agreement approved by the City Council but in
any event, prior to the acquisition of a building permit.



      4.   Exception. For those properties located within the ban
areas as defined in § 8.05.040 the connection capacity fee shall be due in
full at the time of application for a permit for connection to the sewer
system.  The property owner shall also be responsible for all permits, fees
and construction costs (except for cost of sewer lateral from sewer main to
property line arising from connection to the sewer and abandonment of the
denitrifying system). 



   D.   Effluent charges.  All properties receiving effluent shall be
required to pay for fees as adopted from time to time by the City Council,
pursuant to Chapter 3.20, or pursuant to an Effluent Service Agreement.

   A.   A water utility company operating within the city limits shall
provide to the city reports stating the volume of water delivered on a
monthly basis to each of company's water customers served by the city's sewer
system and previously identified to the company by city in writing as being
served by same.  A report shall be provided to city within the time frame
negotiated between company and the city's Administrative Services Director. 
Amounts of water delivered shall be determined and reported from company's
billing and meter records and may on occasion be estimated as a result of
customers not permitting access to meters.



      1.   The city is authorized to enter into written agreements
with water utility companies providing service to sewer customers of the city
located outside the city limits to establish the procedures for:



         a.   Notification of customer water usage;



         b.   Notification to customers of the water utility
company of the requirements of this chapter and the company's intention to

         e.   The agreement between the city and a water utility
company may additionally provide for the payment of a mutually agreed upon
amount between the city and a water utility company for the purpose of
compensating the company for lost revenues, as well as the direct cost
incurred by the utility in terminating water service to a delinquent sewer
utility customer of the city.  City shall not be responsible for collecting
delinquent water accounts for water utility companies described in this
section.

minimum of 7 days notice of the city's intention to terminate sewer services
for violations of city ordinances or regulations.  The notice shall advise
the customer of the right to a hearing before the sewer Board of Appeals as
set forth in this chapter.



      2.   Upon disconnection, city shall estimate the cost of
disconnection and reconnection to the systems, and user shall correct the
violation and deposit an amount, equal to the estimated cost of disconnection
and reconnection, with city, prior to actual reconnection.  City shall
refund any amount of the deposit found to be in excess of the actual costs. 
If actual costs incurred by the city are greater than the deposit posted by
the user, the difference between the actual costs and the deposited amount
shall be paid by the user to the city within 30 days receipt of notice from
the city of the funds owed.  Failure to pay the full amount owed in the time
allotted may result in termination of sewer service and/or other actions as
determined by the city attorney.



   E.   Actions taken under this section for termination of and
disconnection from sewer service may be in addition to any other remedies,
including any injunctive, civil, criminal or abatement actions taken.

§ 8.12.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards and regulations for
various types of alarms of intrusions, burglary, robbery, fire and other
emergency alarm devices, whether by direct line, radio, telephone or other
means that require response thereto by the Police Department, Fire
Department, or other municipal departments within the city, and to provide
for punishment for violations of this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 13-1-1)  (Ord. 13-1090, § 20, passed 3-12-2013)



§ 8.12.020  FINDINGS.



   The Common Council finds:



   A.   The majority of burglary, robbery and fire alarms to which the
city responds are false. Such false alarms result in an enormous waste of
manpower. There are such a large percentage of false alarms as may lull the
police officers into a sense of false security. In responding to an alarm,
they will probably assume it is a false alarm and may be wounded or killed by
criminals at the location;



   B.   Alarm systems which automatically and directly dial any
emergency phone number are very prone to be activated by current failures or
other events having no connection with criminal activity and tie up such
emergency phones, making them unavailable to receive genuine emergency calls;



   C.   The danger to citizens through emergency fire and police
response created by false alarms is unnecessary and hazardous;



   D.   The unnecessary waste of city funds/tax dollars through
responses to false alarms must be eliminated;



   E.   False alarms of any type have created conditions causing danger
and annoyance to the general public.



(Prior Code, § 13-1-2)  (Ord. 13-1090, § 21, passed 3-12-2013)



§ 8.12.030  DEFINITIONS.



   As used in this chapter, the words defined in this section are used as
so defined unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is
intended:

maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving, installing or
monitoring an alarm system in or on any building, structure, place or
premises.



   C.   ALARM SYSTEM.  Any system or device designed or used for the
alerting either directly or indirectly, the city to an unauthorized entry on
premises or to signal the commission of an unlawful act, or to transmit a
warning of fire, smoke or other peril to which the city is expected to
respond.



   D.   ALARM USER.  Any person using an alarm system at his place of
business or residence.



   E.   AUDIBLE ALARM.  An alarm system which creates a sound that can
be heard by persons outside the building, structure, place or facility which
is protected by such alarm device designed for the protection of unauthorized

smoke or fire on the premises, and which device is not monitored by an alarm
business.



   F.   DIRECT DIAL DEVICE.  A device which is connected to a
telephone line and upon activation of an alarm system, automatically dials a
predetermined telephone number and transmits a message or signal indicating
the need for emergency response.



   G.   FALSE ALARM.  The activation of an alarm signal eliciting
response of the police department personnel where a situation requiring said
response does not exist.  It does not include activation for testing
purposes when the police department is given sufficient warning of such
testing.  If an alarm response is cancelled, resulting in police department
personnel not reaching the premises, the activation shall not be considered a
false alarm.  Alarm conditions created by violent conditions of nature will
not be considered a false alarm.



   H.   NUISANCE ALARM.  Any alarm system that actuates excessive
false alarms not generated by violent conditions of nature.



   I.   POLICE CHIEF.  The Deputy Director, Police Services Division,

   For every audible alarm, the alarm owner shall post in a conspicuous
place near the alarm, the names and telephone numbers of persons to be
notified, to render repairs or service during any hour of the day or night
during which the audible alarm is operated. In lieu of the owners’ name and
phone number, the responsible alarm company may substitute a coded number
system approved and controlled by the city. An audible alarm shall terminate
its operation or the audible alarm shall reset automatically within 15
minutes of its being activated. If service is unavailable, audible alarms
which have emitted an alarm signal in excess of 30 minutes are designated as
a nuisance, and the city may cause the alarm to be disconnected by a
registered alarm agent, with the cost to be a charge to the alarm user.

   Any order to disconnect or deactivate an alarm system may be rescinded
by the Fire Department enforcement official upon a finding by the enforcement
official that the owner of the premises has taken corrective action which it
is reasonable to conclude will remedy the cause of the false alarms or alarm
malfunctions at the premises. In making a request for such a rescission, the
owner shall have the burden to show what corrective action has been taken and
that same is sufficient to support a finding that the cause of the false
alarms or alarm malfunctions has been remedied. The enforcement official
shall have the right to inspect the alarm system and test same prior to
rescinding the order to disconnect or deactivate. Before any reconnection of
an alarm system, after the order to disconnect the system, a reconnection fee
established pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 3.20 shall be assessed. The
enforcement official shall not rescind an order to disconnect or deactivate
if the owner has failed to pay any fee charged the owner pursuant to this
Chapter.

§ 8.22.010  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the City of
Lake Havasu City to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3603
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.  Therefore, the City Council of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, does
ordain as follows.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)



§ 8.22.020  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Lake Havasu City are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.



   B.   These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights
and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other
areas.  Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)



§ 8.22.030  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   A.   Protect human life and health;



   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;



   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight
areas caused by flooding;



   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in
an area of special flood hazard;



   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;



   I.   Maintain eligibility for disaster relief.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed --1991)



§ 8.22.040  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.



   These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting
local laws, ordinances and codes.  In order to accomplish its purposes, this
chapter includes methods and provisions to:



   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;



   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;



   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and



   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage.



   JJ.   FLOOD-PROOFING.  Any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce
or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and
sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.



   KK.   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM.  Those physical structural works for
which funds have been authorized; appropriated and expended and which have
been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the
extent the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and

includes dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes.  These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.



   LL.   FLOOD-RELATED EROSION.  The collapse or subsidence of land

on or victimization of the public.  In examining this requirement, the City
Council of Lake Havasu City will consider the fact that every newly
constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part
of the community for 50 to 100 years.  Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.  In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.

chapter, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to
grant the requested variance.  The City Council of Lake Havasu City requires
that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property
involved.  Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. 
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a
rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.  All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost
estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry.



      2.   The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and
functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but
shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence.

§ 8.22.180  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.



   A.   The Operations Department Director or designee is hereby
appointed to administer, implement and enforce this chapter by granting or
denying development permits in accordance with its provisions.



   B.   Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not
be limited to:



      1.   Permit review.  Review all development permits to
determine that:



         a.   The permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied;



         b.   All other required state and federal permits have
been obtained;



         c.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;



         d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect
the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been
determined but a floodway has not been designated.  For purposes of this
chapter "adversely affect" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than 1 foot at any point.



      2.   Substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures.



         a.   Develop detailed procedures for identifying and
administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining "Market Value."



         b.   Assure procedures are coordinated with other
departments and divisions and implemented by community staff.



      3.   Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation
data has not been provided in accordance with § 8.22.070, the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to
administer § 8.22.190.  Any such information shall be consistent with the
requirements of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of
the Arizona Department of Water Resources and shall be submitted to the
Floodplain Board for adoption.



      4.   Obtain and maintain for public inspection.



         a.   The certified regulatory flood elevation required
in § 8.22.190C.1.;



         b.   The flood-proofing certification required in §
8.22.190C.2.;



         c.   The flood vent certification required in §
8.22.190C.3.;



         d.   The elevation certification required for additional
development standards, including subdivisions, in § 8.22.220.A.2;



         e.   The floodway encroachment certification required in
§ 8.22.250.



         f.   Maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued
in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
and



         g.   Obtain and maintain improvement calculations.



      5.   Notification of other entities.



         a.   Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated;



            i.   Notify adjacent communities and the Arizona
Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency through appropriate notification means; and



            ii.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity of
the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse be maintained.



         b.   Base flood elevation and rate of flow due to
physical alterations;



            i.   Base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions.  As
soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the date such
information becomes available, the Floodplain Administrator shall notify the
Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by submitting technical or
scientific data in accordance with Volume 44 Code of Federal Regulations
Section 65.3.  Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.



            ii.   Within 120 days after completion of
construction of any flood control protective works which changes the rate of
flow during the flood or the configuration of the floodplain upstream or
downstream from or adjacent to the project, the person or agency responsible
for installation of the project shall provide to the governing bodies of all
jurisdictions affected by the project a new delineation of all floodplains
affected by the project.  The new delineation shall be done according to the
criteria adopted by the Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources.



         c.   Corporate boundary changes.  Notify the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and the Arizona Department of Water Resources of
acquisition by means of annexation, incorporation or otherwise, of additional
areas of jurisdiction.



      6.   Map determinations.  Make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions).  The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in § 8.22.250.



      7.   Remedial actions. Take actions on violations of this
chapter as required in § 8.22.140 herein.



      8.   Biennial report. Complete and submit a Biennial Report to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.



      9.   Colorado river floodway requirements.  Assure that
proposals for development in the Colorado River Floodway and in the Colorado
River Floodway Fringe meet the additional requirements described in §
8.22.290, including the review and concurrence by the Bureau of Reclamation
before any proposed development in the Colorado River Floodway is permitted.

§ 8.22.250  FLOODWAYS.



   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 8.22.070
are areas designated as floodways.  Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:



   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.



   B.   If § 8.22.250 is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 8.22.190.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008; Ord. 91-364, § 1 (part), passed - -1991)



§ 8.22.260  NATURE OF VARIANCES.



   A.   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on
the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature.  A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners.  The characteristics must
be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.  This
unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure,
its inhabitants or the property owners.



   B.   It is the duty of the City Council of Lake Havasu City to help
protect its citizens from flooding.  This need is so compelling and the
implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory
flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or
from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare.  The
long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited.  Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions
that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.  The criteria
are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than
a variance are more appropriate.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-08)



§ 8.22.270  APPEAL BOARD.



   A.   The Floodplain Board of the City of Lake Havasu City shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.



   B.   The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made
by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.



   C.   In passing upon such applications, the Floodplain Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:



      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;



      2.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage;



      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such  damage on the individual
owner;



      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;



      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location,
where applicable;



      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise,
and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and



      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and
bridges.



   D.   Upon consideration of the factors of  § 8.22.270.C and the
purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.



   E.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:



      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and



      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property; and



      3.   The land upon which the variance is granted shall be
ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and
land exchange program provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2.  A
copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Mohave County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.



   F.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such
variances issued in its biennial report submitted to Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of § 8.22.180 and §
8.22.190 of this chapter have been fully considered.  As the lot size
increases beyond 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing
the variance increases.



   B.   Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.



   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.



   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.



   E.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:



      1.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;



      2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;



      3.   Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.  This
includes only facilities defined in § 8.22.050 of this chapter in the
definition of "Functionally Dependent Use"; and,



      4.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.

§ 8.22.290    COLORADO RIVER FLOODWAY.



   Since the Colorado River Floodway has, under flood conditions, proven
to be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which
carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply to the Colorado River Floodway, in addition to the basic
requirements of § 8.22.180 and § 8.22.190:



   A.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development are prohibited.  Necessary river
control, water conservation, power, water quality structures and related
works, and improvements and alterations to approved structures associated
with allowed uses of the floodway under § 8.22.290.B are excluded from this
prohibition if they follow the NFIP Floodway Revision process described in
the Code of Federal Regulations at 44CFR 65.12 for a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision and the proposed project is reviewed and concurred with by the
Bureau of Reclamation and approved by the community.  Within 6 months of the
completion of the approved project, the as-built data for the project must be
submitted for a Letter of Map Revision to assure the accurate depiction of
the Colorado River Floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps.



   B.   Allowed uses of the floodway may include functions and uses
that serve the public interest, that are compatible with the floodway
operation, and that will not cause a rise in the Colorado River base flood
elevation.  These may include river control, water conservation and
diversion, power and water quality structures and related works; remedial or
corrective actions including, but not limited to, drainage facilities to
assist in controlling adjacent high ground water conditions caused by flood
flows; public and tribal roads; military activities; fish and wildlife
enhancement projects; navigational aids; emergency action assistance; public
health assistance; compatible public, private and tribal recreational
developments such as parks, golf courses, docks and boat launching ramps; and
compatible agricultural uses that do not include permanent crops which would
constitute an obstruction to river flood flows.



   C.   The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed
development that is allowed by § 8.22.310.A.  The proposed development must
be reviewed and concurred with by the Bureau of Reclamation to assure
compatibility with the floodway operation prior to approval of the permit(s).



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008)



§ 8.22.300  COLORADO RIVER FLOODWAY FRINGE.



   The following provisions apply in addition to the basic requirements of
§ 8.22.180 and § 8.22.190:



   A.   Fill, permanent structures or buildings, including residential
structures, may be placed or erected in the Colorado River Floodway Fringe,
provided, in the case of buildings, that the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basements) is at least 1 foot above the Colorado River Base Flood
Elevation.



   B.   Land may be filled, provided the top of the compacted fill
shall at no point be below the Colorado River Base Flood Elevation for at
least 25 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected or placed thereon.



(Ord. 08-935, passed 8-12-2008)



§ 8.22.310  FLOOD-RELATED EROSION-PRONE AREAS OF THE COLORADO RIVER.



   A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed
construction and other development within the floodway fringe area of the
Colorado River.  Such permits shall be reviewed to determine whether the
proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from
flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or
otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.



   B.   If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of
flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement
shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid
aggravating the existing erosion hazard.



   C.   A setback from the floodway is required for all new development
to create a buffer and to provide access to the floodway for possible
maintenance and improvements work.  The buffer may consist of a natural
vegetation or contour strip.  This buffer shall be designated according to
the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rates in relation to the
anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic,
hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land.  The
buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as agriculture,
forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other
activities using temporary and portable structures only.



   D.   A waiver to the setback requirements may be granted if it can
be demonstrated that adequate erosion and flow velocity protection can and
will be constructed and maintained, and provided that the erosion protection
meets the applicable parts of Volume 44, Code of Federal Regulations, Section
65.5(a)(6).  All plans for erosion and flow velocity protection must have
the review and concurrence of the Bureau of Reclamation and be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.

§ 8.28.010  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   Illicit discharges occur due to illicit connections to the municipal
separate storm sewer system from residential, business, industrial, or
commercial establishments. As a result of illicit connections, contaminated
stormwater, wastes, or wastewater enters into storm drains or directly into
local waters without receiving treatment from a wastewater treatment plant.
Illicit connections may be intentional or may be unknown to the property or
business owner. Illicit discharges to the Lake Havasu City stormwater system
can cause excessive discharges of pollutants to surface waters and
groundwater.  These discharges can negatively impact public health, welfare,
and the environment by transporting and depositing pollutants.



(Ord. 14-1105, passed 1-14-2014)



§ 8.28.020  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for health, safety,
and general welfare within Lake Havasu City through the regulation of all
stormwater to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state law. Unless expressly authorized
or exempted by this chapter, no person shall cause, participate in, or allow
the discharge to a public right-of-way or public storm drain system of any
substance that is not composed entirely of stormwater.  This chapter
establishes authority to conduct and require inspection, monitoring,
reporting, and enforcement activities to address the prevention,
identification, and remediation of illicit discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system.  It is the intent of this chapter to comply
with Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations for
stormwater discharges, to be consistent with the stormwater quality
provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act, and to enable the city to comply
with all applicable stormwater quality provisions of federal, state, and
local laws and regulations to ensure the future health, safety, and general
welfare within the city, as well as the protection and preservation of the
local environment.



   B.   The standards promulgated by the chapter are minimum standards;
therefore, it is not intended or implied that compliance with the provisions
of this chapter by any person will ensure that there will be no
contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.

stormwater, or permitted non-stormwater discharge of any type to the MS4 may
occur as a result of, or in conjunction with the implementation of the
plan.  To the extent that the discharge would be an illicit discharge, if
connected to the MS4, the plan shall include BMP measures to remove or
prevent the illicit discharge during and after construction of the
improvement or project. The BMP shall be subject to approval of the city.



   C.   Persons shall maintain the BMP during and after construction
until such time as final stabilization of the site has been performed.  This
shall apply to persons initiating a project and to heirs and assigns. Changes
to the BMP approved at the time of a project implementation shall be sent to
the city in writing.  The revised BMP shall be at least as effective in
preventing pollution as the original BMP or as then currently required by the
city. The city reserves the right to require changes in BMP as necessary to
assure that discharges to the MS4 are of a quantity and quality that the city
will not be in violation of the permits under which it is allowed to
discharge stormwater. Sites requiring post construction (permanent) BMPs
shall require an Operations and Maintenance Agreement be provided to the city
identifying responsibility for operation and maintenance of the facility and
for providing perpetual access to the city for inspection of the facility.



   D.   The city shall be granted access to all facilities and lands
discharging any water or other material to the MS4.



   E.   Persons further developing parcels and/or lots that are part of
a larger development, regardless of the time elapsed, shall utilize current
BMP methods that are at least as effective as those identified in the
stormwater pollution prevention plan for the larger development or necessary
to comply with regulations, laws, and codes current at the time of further
developing, whichever is more stringent.  Appropriate permits required by
the state shall be acquired by further developers.



   F.   Site-specific stormwater pollution prevention plans shall be
developed for all construction projects 1 acre or greater in size and a
Notice of Intent (NOI) shall be filed with ADEQ.  The site-specific plan
shall identify the minimum BMPs to be utilized upon further development of
the project area, when the person submitting the plan will not develop the
entire project though building occupancy or other full development intent. 
Smaller areas may develop a site-specific plan.



   G.   The city may develop, publish, and update from time to time
general stormwater pollution guidelines.  These guidelines shall at minimum
address pollution caused by soil erosion, motor oil, trash, and landscape
debris.

permit.  Proof of compliance with said permit shall be required. An
authorized representative of the city shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under industrial or construction activity
permits at reasonable times and as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in effect
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the city.



(Ord. 14-1105, passed 1-14-2014)



§ 8.28.130  SUSPENSION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF ILLICIT DISCHARGE.



   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may be
subject to MS4 access termination if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed
termination date of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a
reconsideration and hearing.  A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section,
without the prior approval of the city.

than otherwise permitted herein if, upon application, a permit is obtained
from the Development Services Department.  The owner of the property or
contractor or entity to whom the original building permit was issued is
responsible for obtaining this permit.  In granting such permit, the
director of the Development Services Department shall consider whether
construction noise in the vicinity of the proposed work site would be less
objectionable at night than during the daytime because of the different
population levels or different neighborhood activities; whether obstruction
and interference with traffic, particularly on streets of major importance,
would be less objectionable at night than during the daytime; whether the
kind of work to be performed emits noises at such a low level as to not cause
significant disturbance of the reasonable peaceful enjoyment of the
surrounding neighbors in the vicinity of the work site; whether the
neighborhood of the proposed work site is primarily residential in character
wherein sleep would be disturbed; whether great economic hardship would occur
if the work were spread over a longer time; whether the work will abate or
prevent hazard to life or property; whether the proposed early morning or
night work is in the general public interest. The Director shall prescribe
such conditions, working times, types of construction equipment to be used
and permissible noise emissions as the director deems appropriate in the
public interest. No permit shall be required to perform emergency work
necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public
calamity, work required to protect the health, safety or welfare of persons
or property or work by private or public utilities when restoring utility
service. 



   E.   Revocation of permits; appeal.  The director may revoke any
permit granted hereunder upon complaints based upon substantial evidence that
the construction work causes significant disturbance of the reasonable
peaceful enjoyment of the surrounding neighbors in the vicinity of the work
site. Any person aggrieved by the granting of a permit or the refusal to
grant a permit by the director may appeal the decision to the city manager. 
The city manager will issue a final decision within 30 days of the appeal. 
 



   F.   Stop orders.  Whenever any work on a construction project is
in violation of the provisions of this section, the Development Services
Department may issue a Red Tag, which is a written request to stop
construction until the necessary corrections are made and/or permits are
obtained.

LOADS.



   A.   The Chief of Police or designee, upon written application and
with good cause being shown, may issue an overdimensional or overweight
permit, authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle, or
combination of vehicles, of a size, weight, or load exceeding the maximum

pursuant to and in conformity with the provisions of Title 28, Chapter 6,
Article 18, of the Arizona Revised Statutes.



   C.   The Chief of Police or designee may establish seasonal or other
time limitations on these permits within which the vehicles described may be
operated on the highways indicated, or otherwise limit and prescribe
conditions of operation of the vehicles when necessary, to ensure against
undue damage on the road infrastructure or surfaces, and may require other
security as deemed necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or
road structure.  The person for whom a permit is issued is liable for any
damage caused by his or her actions, and for the actions of parties carrying
out the work covered under the permit.



   D.   A permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle, or combination of vehicles, to which it refers, and shall be open

the 30-day period does not exceed the specifications listed on the permit. 
A single trip permit may be issued under the same premise as is a 30-day
permit, but is valid for only 3 days from the date of issuance. 



   G.   Applications for permits described in this chapter must be
submitted to the police department not less than 5 working days prior to the
time that work, described on the permit, is to commence.



   H.   At the discretion of the Chief of Police or designee, a permit
holder may be required to have escorts and/or certified peace officers to
accompany loads.  Non-police escorts shall be trained in traffic direction
and control by the permit holder and shall utilize vehicle markings that are
visible from a minimum of 200 feet in daylight.  The Chief of Police or
designee may establish permitted times during the day for such loads.  Any
restrictions shall be stated on the permit.



   I.   Loads with widths wider than 25 feet or with heights greater

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 11.04.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
welfare and economic stability of the community and establish a quality
system of public improvements adequate to support existing and planned
development. The city intends to fairly allocate the responsibility for the
construction of necessary public improvements to those developments creating
additional demands on such public improvement systems as such development
occurs.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-1)



§ 11.04.020  PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS DEFINED.



   Public improvements are defined as community facilities and services
necessary to serve a proposed development and to progressively implement
current master service plans. The improvements shall include, but not be
limited to, streets, sidewalks, water mains, fire hydrants, sanitary sewers,
storm drains, traffic controls, and such public rights of way necessary to
accommodate the improvements; the improvements being provided at service
levels and according to design standards and specifications contained in the
document entitled “Lake Havasu City Standard Detail Drawings” and its
amendments; consistent with respective master plans for the public
improvements as may be adopted by the City Council and in accordance with
this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-2)



§ 11.04.030  DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.



   Except within R-1, R-2, A-1, A-2, R -A and RMH zones, no new building
shall hereinafter be erected, and no existing building shall be relocated or
altered so as to increase the total value or total floor area of buildings
existing on the site on the effective date of this chapter by 50% or more, as
determined by the building official, for the purpose of establishing the
equitable fee due under those codes established pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 3.20 prior to issuance of a building permit, unless concurrently with
new construction, relocation or alteration, public improvements as defined in
this chapter serving the building phase lot or parcel upon which a building
permit is issued shall have been constructed and dedicated to public use and
accepted for public maintenance. Where the construction, alterations, or
additions consist solely of the installation or replacement of mechanical
equipment, off-site improvements are not requirements of this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-3)  (Ord. 94-449, § 3, passed - -1994)



ARTICLE II. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES



§ 11.04.040  GENERALLY.



   Except as otherwise provided, public improvements installed by a
developer either as a requirement of these regulations or at his or her own
option shall conform to the requirements of this chapter and shall be
installed in accordance with the procedure detailed in this article.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-4 (part))



§ 11.04.050  IMPROVEMENTS PLAN REVIEW.



   A.   No building permit for construction requiring public
improvements pursuant to this chapter shall be issued and no public
improvements shall be undertaken until designed and engineered improvement
plans and any necessary construction and/or permanent easements have been
submitted to and approved by the city, an acceptable performance guarantee
has been approved by the City Attorney, and an off-site improvement permit
has been issued. The following steps shall be completed prior to issuance of
a building permit:



      1.   Preliminary public improvements plans. Preliminary
improvements plans shall be included on preliminary site plans submitted to
the Community Services Department consistent with the City Code requirements,
prior to site plan review.



      2.   Final public improvements plans. Final public
improvements plans and necessary easement documents shall be included with
final site plans submitted to the Community Services Department and approved
by the City.



      3.   Performance guarantee. To assure his or her full and
faithful performance in the construction of the required improvements
according to the approved construction plans, the developer shall file
security acceptable to the city in an amount equal to 100% of the approved
estimate of the cost of the improvements. Security may be provided in one of
the following forms:



         i.   Personal bond. A personal bond cosigned by at least
1 additional person. The developer and cosigners shall submit evidence of
financial responsibility and the financial resources of those signing the
bond shall provide a reasonable assurance of the ability of the developer to
proceed in accordance with the approved improvement plans.



         ii.   Surety bond. A surety bond executed by a surety
company authorized to transact business in the State of Arizona.



         iii.   Irrevocable letter of credit. An irrevocable
letter of credit authorizing the city to draw on the applicant's account upon
failure of the applicant to install required improvements.



         iv.   Performance guarantee deposit. The assurances of
full and faithful performance shall be for a sum approved by the Community
Services Department as sufficient to cover the cost of improvements.
Performance guarantee deposits may be in the form of certificates of deposit
that can be cashed by either the developer or city, checks in the name of
Lake Havasu City, or credit card transactions. Upon acceptance of the
required improvements, the performance guarantee deposit shall be released to
the developer; however, no refunds will be processed within 15 business days
of initial payment or deposit. If the deposit is made in the form of a joint
certificate of deposit, any interest accruing on the certificate shall also
be released to the developer. Checks and credit card transactions shall be
deposited to the city's accounts upon receipt and a city check shall be
issued to the developer in the amount of the performance guarantee. No
interest shall accrue to the developer from checks presented pursuant to this
section. The required improvements must be installed, inspected, and approved
by the Community Services Department at least 30 days prior to the expiration
of the bond or letter of credit or extension thereof. In the event the
developer fails to install all required improvements prior to occupancy, the
city shall call on the bond or performance guarantee deposit to complete the
improvements. If insufficient funds exist to complete the improvements, the
city may expend sufficient funds to complete the improvements and developer
shall be billed for the additional expenditures.



      4.   Improvements construction permit. Upon approval of the
improvements plans by the Community Services Department, the developer shall
obtain an improvements construction permit.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-4(A))  (Ord. 13-1096, § 1, passed 7-9-2013; Ord.
93-412, passed - -1992)



§ 11.04.060  CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.



   A.   No certificate of occupancy for construction requiring public
improvements pursuant to this chapter shall be issued until the following
steps have been completed:



      1.   Monumentation. Prior to construction of the improvements,
all property corners and points of curvature and tangency shall be installed
by a registered land surveyor. The developer shall be responsible for the
preservation of the monuments.



      2.   Acceptance of improvements. Upon completion of
improvements the developer shall call for a final inspection by the Community
Services Department. Improvements will be considered complete when they have
been inspected and accepted by the Community Services Department, with
certification in writing to the building official that the required off-site
improvements have been constructed and all required easements have been
accepted consistent with approved plans. Upon city acceptance of required
off-site improvements the performance guarantee shall be released.



      3.   Improvements guarantee. At the time of city acceptance of
the improvements, the developer shall file with the city an improvements
guarantee in an amount equal to 100% of the full value of the improvements to
provide for the correction of any defective work becoming apparent or arising
within 1 year after final acceptance of the public improvements.



      4.   As-built plans. A complete set of reproducible plans
showing the required improvements as built shall be filed with the Community
Services Department upon completion of the improvements.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-4(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 2, passed 7-9-2013)



ARTICLE III. OFFSITE IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT



§ 11.04.070  OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS.



   A.   When, in the opinion of the Community Services Department, the
installation of any of the off-site improvements will create a drainage or
maintenance problem, or will be more effective if installed along with other
city planned improvements, the Community Services Director may require the
developer to enter into an offsite improvement agreement in lieu of the
installation of the required offsite improvements. Offsite improvement
agreements will only be used at the direction of the Community Services
Director. The only offsite improvements that will be included in an offsite
improvement agreement are street widening, curbs, sidewalks, and any drainage
improvements (i.e., scuppers, swales, culvert pipes, and the like) that are
necessary but will not function efficiently without other planned
improvements.



   B.   The property owner shall enter into an offsite improvement
agreement with the city to pay for the required offsite improvements. A cash
payment for the improvements shall be made to the city in the form of a
cashier's check by or on behalf of the property owner in the amount estimated
by the city for the cost of the installation of such offsite improvements.
City shall credit the amount to city's Offsite Improvement Agreement General
Ledger Account for future public works projects. At the option of the city,
all such cash deposits shall be used to defray the cost of such installation
of the required offsite improvements.



   C.   When the Community Services Director determines that an offsite
improvement agreement is required for a property, the building permit and
permit to perform work on the public right-of-way for the development will
not be issued until such time as the cash deposit has been received and the
executed agreement has been accepted by the City Manager.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-5(A))  (Ord. 13-1096, § 3, passed 7-9-2013; Ord.
98-558, passed - -1998)



§ 11.04.080  STREET AND SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS IN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL
AREAS.



   A.   The City Council may grant a request for deferment of the
requirements of § 11.04.030 upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission for developments within commercial and
industrial zoning districts, provided the following requirements are met:



      1.   Developable land is within a planned development rezoning
request and is addressed within a development agreement; and



      2.   The property owner has executed with the city an
agreement to submit plans and commence construction of deferred improvements
pursuant to § 11.04.030 within 90 days and complete the improvements within
180 days after the receipt of written notice by the Community Services
Director at such time as it has been determined by the Community Services
Director that 60% or more of the developable land in the tract has been
developed. The agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Mohave County
Recorder and run with the land.



   B.   If the improvements specified above are not commenced or
completed in compliance with the Community Services Director’s written
notice, the Council may direct that the deferred improvements be constructed
or completed by the city.



   C.   Whenever deferred improvements are constructed or completed by
the city pursuant to subsection B of this section, the actual costs of the
improvements shall be assessed against the subject property. Any such
assessment shall be a lien against the property, and the city’s
Administrative Services Director or his or her designee shall cause the lien
to be recorded against the property.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-5(B)) (Ord. 13-1096, § 4, passed 7-9-2013)



ARTICLE IV. STREETS



§ 11.04.090  CREATION OF A PUBLIC STREET.



   The creation of a public street shall be in accordance with provisions
of the Title 13 of this code and the provisions of the Arizona Revised
Statutes.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(A))



§ 11.04.100  REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.



   A.   Whenever any proposed development contains or abuts an existing
or proposed street which is either unimproved or of substandard right-of-way
width or improvement according to the transportation master plan, city
specifications and standards, and the standards of this article, the
necessary right-of-way shall be dedicated to the city prior to the issuance
of a building permit for the proposed development, and the improvements
completed and accepted by the city as consistent with the plan and standards,
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the proposed development,
subject to the following exceptions:



      1.   Improvements to existing streets. Where a development
abuts an existing street, the improvements requirement shall apply only to
that portion of the street right-of-way located between the centerline of the
right-of-way and the property line of the lot proposed for development. In no
event shall a required street improvement for an existing street exceed a
pavement width of 30 feet.



      2.   Proposed streets.  Where a development includes or abuts
a proposed street, in no event shall the required pavement width exceed 30
feet.



      3.   Partial-width streets. Partial-width streets, while
generally not acceptable, may be created and/or improved where essential to
the reasonable development of the subdivision, when in conformity with the
other requirements of these regulations and when the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other
portion when the adjoining property is developed. Whenever a partial-width
street is adjacent to a tract to be developed, the other portion of the
street shall be shown on the proposed plan. Reserve strips and street plugs
may be required to preserve the objectives of partial-width streets.



      4.   Nature and extent of improvements. Streets required to be
dedicated and/or improved pursuant to this section shall be improved to city
standards and specifications and shall include curbs, sidewalks, and, where
designated on the appropriate master plan, bikeways. Catchbasins shall be
installed where required and connected to drainageways. Upon completion of
the street improvement, monuments shall be reestablished and protected in
monument boxes at every public street intersection and all points of
curvature and points of tangency of their center lines. Street signs on
newly-created streets shall be installed at street intersections in standard
locations.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(B))  (Ord. 13-1096, § 5, passed 7-9-2013)



§ 11.04.110  GENERAL LOCATION AND DESIGN.



   A.   Generally.  The location, width and grade of streets shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, and to the proposed use of land to be served by the
streets. The street system shall assure adequate traffic circulation and that
it is convenient and safe. Intersection angles, grades, tangents, and curves
shall be appropriate for the traffic to be carried, considering the terrain.
Street determination shall be coordinated with any need for utility locations.



   B.   Relationship to the future street system. Location of a street
will ordinarily be shown in the transportation element of the comprehensive
plan and future street plan refinement of the comprehensive plan. The
arrangement of public streets shall provide for the continuation or
appropriate projection of existing streets in the surrounding area, except
for deviations to meet a particular situation where topographical or other
conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical.



   C.   Underground utilities.



      1.   In newly subdivided areas all utility lines, including
but not limited to those required for electric, communication, lighting and
cable television services and related facilities, shall be placed
underground, except surface-mounted transformers, surface-mounted connection
boxes and water cabinets, which may be placed above ground, temporary utility
service facilities during construction, high-capacity electric and
communication feeder lines, and utility transmission lines operating at
50,000 volts or above. The developer shall make all necessary arrangements
with the serving utility to provide the underground services. The city
reserves the right to approve location of all surface-mounted transformers.



      2.   Provision for all underground utilities, including
sanitary sewers installed in streets by the developer, shall be constructed
prior to the surfacing of the streets. Stubs for service connections shall be
long enough to avoid disturbing the street improvements when service
connections are made.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-7(C))



§ 11.04.120  GENERAL STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.



   A.   Street right-of-way and pavement width.



      1.   Unless otherwise indicated on the comprehensive plan or
on a separately approved future street plan, the street right-of-way and
roadway widths shall not be less than the minimum width in feet shown in the
following table:

      2.   Where conditions, particularly topography or the size and
shape of the tract, make it impractical to otherwise provide buildable sites,
narrower rights-of-way may be accepted, ordinarily not less than 60 feet. If
necessary, slope easements may be required.



   B.   Reserve strips. Reserve strips or street plugs controlling the
access to streets will not be approved unless necessary for the protection of
the public welfare or of substantial property rights, and in these cases they
may be required. The control and disposal of land composing such strips shall
be placed within the jurisdiction of the city under conditions approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   C.   Street alignment. All streets shall, as far as practicable, be
in alignment with existing streets by continuations of the centerlines
thereof. In no case shall the staggering of streets make a "T" intersection
(or) be so designed as to allow a dangerous condition. Offsets of less than
100 feet will not be allowed.



   D.   Future extension of streets. Where necessary to give access to
or permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall
extend to the boundary of the subdivision; and the resulting dead-end streets
may be approved without a turnaround. Reserve strips, including street plugs,
may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.



   E.   Street intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to
intersect at angles as near to right angles as practical except where
topography requires a lesser angle, but in no case shall the acute angle be
less than 80 degrees unless there is a special intersection design. An
arterial or collector street intersecting with another street shall have at
least 100 feet of tangent adjacent to the intersection unless topography
requires a lesser distance. Other streets, except alleys, shall have at least
50 feet of tangent adjacent to the intersection. Intersections which contain
an acute angle of less than 80 degrees or which include an arterial street
shall have a minimum corner radius sufficient to allow for a roadway edge
radius of 20 feet and maintain a uniform width between the roadway and the
right-of-way line. Ordinarily, the intersection of more than 2 streets at any
one point will not be approved.



   F.   Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall be as short as possible and
shall in no event be more than 400 feet long. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate
with a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 45 feet.
The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along the centerline of the
roadway from the near side of the intersecting street to the farthest point
of the cul-de-sac.



   G.   Street names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate
or be confused with the names of existing streets in the city, except for
extensions of existing streets. Street names and numbers shall conform to the
established pattern in the surrounding area.



   H.   Grades and curves. Grades shall not exceed 6% on arterials, 10%
on collector streets, or 12% on other streets. Centerline radii of curves
shall not be less than 300 feet on major arterials, 200 feet on minor
arterials or 100 feet on other streets, and shall be to an even 10 feet.
Where existing conditions, particularly the topography, make it otherwise
impractical to provide buildable sites, steeper grades, and sharper curves
may be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. In flat areas,
allowance shall be made for finished street grades having a minimum slope,
preferably of at least 0.5%.



   I.   Protection from major streets. Where a development abuts or
contains Highway 95, an existing or proposed arterial, or a collector street,
the development design shall provide adequate protection for residential
properties and shall separate through and local traffic or, if separation is
not feasible, shall minimize the traffic conflicts. The design requirements
may include any of the following:



      1.   A parallel access stream;



      2.   Lots of suitable depth abutting the major street with
frontage along another street;



      3.   Other treatment suitable to meet the objectives of this
subsection.



   J.   Median islands. Median islands may be used on arterial or
collector streets for the purpose of controlling access, providing turn
refuges, or for aesthetic purposes.



   K.   Curbs. Curbs shall be installed on both sides of public streets
and shall be at least 6 inches in height.



   L.   Transit facilities. New developments along existing or proposed
transit routes may be required to provide areas and facilities for bus
turnouts, shelters, and other transit-related facilities needed to serve the
development.



   M.   Traffic controls. The Community Services Department may require
that the owner complete a competent engineering traffic impact analysis to
determine the number and types of traffic controls (traffic lights, signs,
turn lanes) as may be necessary to accommodate anticipated traffic flow and
that will be required by the city as a condition of issuance of a building
permit. The analysis will be completed according to specifications
established by the city. Review and approval of the analysis by the Community
Services Director shall be required prior to issuance of a construction
permit.

ARTICLE VI. FIRE PROTECTION FACILITIES



§ 11.04.160  GENERALLY.



   A consultation with the Fire Department should be arranged early in the
development review process to avoid costly revamping of plans or ideas. The
following items are general design requirements. Specific requirements are to
be determined in consultations with the Fire Department and shall be
consistent with all applicable codes administered by the Department.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-6 (part))



§ 11.04.170  REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.



   A.   An approved water supply capable of supplying required fire
flow for fire protection shall be provided to all premises upon which
buildings or portions of buildings are hereafter constructed. When any
portion of the building protected is in excess of 150 feet from a water
supply on a public street, there shall be provided, when required by the
Chief, on-site fire hydrants and mains capable of supplying the required fire
flow.



   B.   The Fire Chief may prescribe that the development include
installation of such on-site fire-protection facilities as in his or her
judgment are necessary to provide an adequate water supply on the land to be
developed. The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or developer.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-6(A))  (Ord. 13-1096, § 8, passed 7-9-2013)



§ 11.04.180  GENERAL FIRE PROTECTION FACILITY STANDARDS.



   A.   All facilities required to be installed under this article
shall be approved by and meet the specifications of the Fire Chief and the
Community Services Director as to location, size and type of materials, and
manner of installation.



      1.   Water supply.



         i.   Minimum fire flow.



            a.   Standards published by the Insurance Services
Office, entitled "Guide for Determination of Required Fire Flows" and the
provisions of International Fire Code shall serve as a guide to determine
capacity of facilities required to furnish an adequate water supply to
individual buildings and is hereby included by reference within this
subsection.



            b.   The fire protection facilities shall be
adequate to convey the required quantity of water, as determined by the
above-cited standards, to any outlet in the system; with no less than 20
pounds per square inch residual pressure at the outlet being considered, with
the required quantity of water flowing.



      2.   Access to fire protection facilities. Whenever any
hydrant or other appurtenance for use by the Fire Department is required to
be installed under the provisions of this section, there shall be included in
the improvements plan, and delineated thereon, adequate provisions for access
to and from every such hydrant and appurtenance by firefighting equipment.
Such access shall be in the form of an improved, permanently-maintained
roadway or of an open paved area, or any combination thereof, designed,
constructed and at all times maintained in such a manner that there shall be
an accessway kept clear and unobstructed at such grades, and having
sufficient width and height clearance, as to permit ingress and egress by
firefighting equipment. With respect to hydrants located along private
accessways where curbs exist, the curbs shall be painted red by the owner,
lessee, or other person in charge of the premises to prohibit parking for a
distance of 15 feet in either direction from any hydrant. In such cases where
curbs do not exist, there shall be appropriate markings painted on the
pavement, or signs erected, or both, giving notice that parking is prohibited
for a distance of 15 feet from any such hydrant. If, in the judgment of the
Fire Chief, it is necessary to prohibit vehicular parking along private
accessways in order to keep them clear and unobstructed, he or she may
require the developer, owner, lessee, or other person in charge of the
premises to paint the curbs or install signs or give other appropriate notice
to the effect that parking is prohibited by the Fire Department. It shall
thereafter be unlawful for any such owner, lessee, or other person in charge
to fail to install and maintain in good condition the form of notice so
prescribed.



      3.   Timing of facilities installation. Facilities are to be
provided during the initial stage of construction. When it is deemed that
firefighting facilities are required to be installed, as required by this
article, by the developer, the facilities as may be required shall be
installed and made serviceable prior to or at the time any combustible
construction begins on the land, unless, in the opinion of the Fire Chief,
the nature or circumstances of the facilities makes it impractical to so
require.



      4.   Maintenance of facilities. All on-site fire-protection
facilities shall at all times be maintained in good working order by the
owner thereof. To this end, the Fire Chief is hereby empowered at his or her
discretion to conduct periodic tests and inspection of the facilities. If the
Fire Chief determines that the facilities are not being maintained as
required by this article, he or she may order that the owner or lessee of the
land make the necessary repairs or changes within 10 days, or such longer
time as in his or her judgment is reasonable. It shall be unlawful for any
such person to fail or refuse to comply with any such order.



      5.   Operation or modification of facilities. On site
fire-protection facilities may only be altered or repaired with the consent
of the Fire Chief provided, that such alteration or repairs shall be carried
out in compliance with the International Fire Code and accepted engineering
practices.



(Prior Code, § 14-1-6(B))  (Ord. 13-1096, § 9, passed 7-9-2013)



§ 11.04.190  FIRE LANES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.



   A.   The Fire Chief may require that fire lanes for new and existing
structures be established on private or public property to provide access for
fire-suppression operations by the use of an improved public street, areaway,
parking lot, driveway or roadway.



   B.   A fire lane is an area, parking lot, driveway, roadway or
portion thereof that shall be:



      1.   Designated or approved by the Fire Chief;



      2.   Identified with red painted curbs or 6-inch-wide red
stripe the full length of the fire lane, or each fire lane shall have
approved signs at the beginning and end of the fire lane, with spacing
between the signs not to exceed 75 feet. The signs shall be approved by the
Fire Chief and comply with Appendix A, Standard Detail No.1 of this chapter.
Each sign shall face in the direction of oncoming traffic. Signs that
identify entranceways only as a fire lane area shall be identified with
approved fire lane sign(s) on each side facing forward, and area between the
signs shall be red striped.



   C.   A fire lane sign shall be:



      1.   Affixed to a stationary pole or object;



      2.   Plainly visible;



      3.   Maintained clear of obstructions its entire length.

points 24 feet in width and of length and interval as designated by the Fire
Chief;



      4.   Be surfaced to support maximum weight of fire apparatus.
Surfacing may be concrete, asphaltic concrete, brick, stone, but not
necessarily limited to such materials, as approved by the Fire Chief.
Engineering data shall be submitted with plans review submittal to
substantiate weight-bearing capacity when required by the Fire Chief;



      5.   Have a vertical clearance of not less than 13 feet 6
inches;



      6.   Have a maximum gradient of 8% (8 feet in 100 feet);



      7.   Have 45 feet minimum centerline radius on curves;



      8.   Be dead-ended at no more than 200 feet maximum length; or
allow through passage; or terminate in minimum 45 feet centerline radius
cul-de-sac as per Standard Detail No. 2 or hammerhead turning area as per
Standard Detail No. 2, see Appendix B to this chapter.



   G.   It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to post a fire lane
sign without the approval of the Fire Chief or his or her authorized
representative.



   H.   Fire lanes established for new and existing structures shall
conform to fire lane requirements applicable at the time of construction,
provided that if no fire lane requirements were applicable at the time of
construction, the Fire Chief may require establishment of fire lanes to
conform with the requirements.



   I.   The specific requirements for this article as applicable to a
specific structure may be modified by the Fire Chief in recognition of
varying occupancies, sizes and hazards of buildings and the provisions of
other means of access or fixed fire protection.



   J.   No person shall place or keep any post, fence, growth, trash or
other material or thing near any fire hydrant, fire sprinkler connection or
fire standpipe connection that would prevent them from being immediately
discernible or in any other manner deter or hinder the Fire Department from
gaining immediate access to them for use. Signs or red painted curbs or
6-inch-wide red stripes the full length of the restricted area, prohibiting
blocking the fire protection equipment, may be required on private property
installation.

line extension, the city will make available to the developer a payback
agreement, whereby the city will agree to collect a portion of the design,
inspection and construction costs from parties, other than the city abutting
the extension and proposing to connect thereto.



(Ord. 89-271, (part), passed - -1989)



§ 11.04.320  PROVISIONS OF AGREEMENT.



   A.   The payback agreement shall include the following provisions:



      1.   The term of the agreement shall be 20 years.



      2.   The payback fee shall be based on the certified cost of
the water or sewer line extension after deducting therefrom the developer's
share of the costs and the costs of city participation, if any. The costs
must be certified to the Community Services Director with paid receipts from
the contractor installing the improvements.



      3.   Owners of lots abutting a water or sewer line extension
that is the subject of a payback agreement and who desire to connect to the
line extension shall pay the payback fee at the time of the issuance of the
building permit or the system connection permit, whichever is earlier.



      4.   The developer who installed the line extension shall be
paid all funds collected under the payback agreement.



      5.   The term of the agreement shall run from the date upon
which the system extension was accepted by the city.



(Ord. 13-1096, § 15, passed 7-9-2013; Ord. 89-274, (part), passed - -1989)



§ 11.04.330  CALCULATION OF PAYBACK FEES.



   A.   For system extensions which abut unserved lots on either side
thereof, the amount collected from parties connecting to the line extension
will be calculated by multiplying the frontage of the lot making connection
to the system by the total cost of the improvements and dividing the product
by the summation of the total lot frontages served by the improvements.



   B.   For system extensions which abut unserved lots on only 1 side
thereof, the amount collected from parties connecting to the line extension
will be calculated by multiplying the certified cost per lineal foot of the
line extension by the total frontage of the lot making connection to the
system, measured in feet.



   C.   Frontage is the measure, in feet, of the property line which is
parallel to the right-of-way where the line subject to the payback is located.



   D.   For corner lots, frontage shall be calculated in the same
manner as is provided for in subsection C of this section.



(Ord. 89-274, (part), passed - -1989)



§ 11.04.340  ADMINISTRATION.

§ 11.04.350  TIME OF EXECUTION.



   Payback agreements shall be executed not later than 120 days after the
acceptance of the line extension by the city, or the right to such agreements
shall be deemed waived. The developer shall provide receipts for
certification not later than 20 days from the date of the acceptance.

ARTICLE XIII - LANDSCAPE FEATURES - GENERAL MAINTENANCE




§ 11.04.510  LANDSCAPE FEATURES—GENERAL MAINTENANCE.



   A.   Trees are recognized as providing very tangible benefits that
promote the health, safety, and general welfare to residents of Lake Havasu
City. Trees are a particularly valuable resource in retaining the
attractiveness of the city's resort character, thereby increasing and
enhancing the economic development and quality of life. Healthy trees serve
as a natural buffer zone between traffic generated by various land uses and
the streets that serve them. In addition, trees help enhance the visual and
aesthetic qualities that attract visitors and businesses to the entire city.
Healthy trees reduce air and noise pollution, enhance aesthetics and property
values, and are an important contributor to the city's image, pride, and
quality of life. It is the intent of this section to prevent the unnecessary
removal of trees. It is not to be interpreted as an expansion of landscaping
requirements.



   B.   The Operations Director or his or her designee, shall have the
authority to promulgate the rules and regulations of the Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice governing the planting, maintenance,
removal, fertilization, pruning, and bracing of trees on the streets or other
public sites in the municipality, and shall direct, regulate, and control the
planting, maintenance, and removal of all trees growing now or hereafter in
any public area of the city, and shall cause the provisions of this section
to be enforced.



(Ord. 13-1096, § 19, passed 7-9-2013; Ord. 01-626, passed - -2001)



§ 11.04.990  APPEAL—VARIANCE.



   Any applicant may appeal for relief from the terms of these regulations
to the City Council, and the City Council may authorize variances from the
terms of this chapter where, by reason of an exceptional or extraordinary
situation or condition of a lot or parcel of land, the strict application of
any of the regulations enacted in this chapter would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties or undue hardships upon the applicant.
Such a variance or relief may be given provided the relief may be guaranteed
without detriment to the public good and without impairing the intent and
purposes of this chapter.

provision of this section shall govern.



   B.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for the purposes
of this resolution, unless otherwise from context:



      DECKING and DECK SURFACE.   Describes the type of material to be
used for the deck and general conditions of repair that shall be maintained.



      FLOTATION. Material describes acceptable types of material to be
used to provide buoyancy for the dock.



      FREEBOARD.  The distance from the top of the deck to the water
line.



      OR EQUIVALENT.  when used in the foregoing standards is intended
to allow for latitude in construction and maintenance; however, the
equivalency of any variation from these standards shall be fully demonstrated
to the council prior to actual construction.



      SIZE. Refers to minimum dimensions for fingers and gangways.



      SLIP.  A berth or docking area designed to accommodate one boat.



      STABILITY.  The ability of a dock to remain stationary during
use. STABILITY has been divided into three types: roll stability (motion
about the centerline of a dock and finger), pitch stability (motion in the
vertical plane), and yaw stability (motion in the horizontal plane).



   C.   Stability—general.  All docks shall be constructed to
provide a firm, stable footing for persons stepping onto the dock either from
shore or from a boat moored to the dock.



   D.   Roll stability. Fingers of u-shaped slips shall allow minimum
roll or rocking motion during use. All portions of all docks shall be so
constructed that a concentrated weight of 400 pounds placed anywhere on the
deck surface shall not over-stress dock members nor shall it cause the dock
surface to tilt more than 6 degrees from the horizontal.



   E.   Pitch stability. All portions of docks shall be constructed to
minimize pitching due to activity on the dock.



   F.   Yaw stability. All portions of docks shall be constructed to
minimize yaw due to activity on the dock, without appreciable lateral
movement or over-stressing the dock structure.

shall be resistant to gasoline and hydrocarbons (a urethane coating or
equivalent); or



      2.   Foam billets. Foam billets shall have the vertical
surfaces and bottoms protected with a minimum of 125 mil plastic coating or
three-fourths-inch reinforced lightweight concrete. Such coatings shall
extend a minimum of 2 inches on to the upper horizontal surface. A gasoline
and hydrocarbon-resistant coating must be used within 50 feet of gas pumps,
dispensers, or nozzles. All existing foam billets that are replaced shall
meet the standards set forth in this section.



   J.   Decking and deck surface. All decking or deck surface
(including carpeting or other materials) shall not contain loose material,
holes, or tears which could present a hazard. Wood shall be painted or
otherwise sealed on all sides. CCX plywood may be used as a deck surface
provided that all surfaces have been coated with an exterior grade paint and
carpeting or an equivalent deck surfacing is then applied. All decking shall
provide a non-skid surface free from hazards. The perimeter surfaces of docks
and fingers shall have protective, resilient bumpers.



   K.   Mooring device. Number and placement to be determined during
plan review. Mooring devices shall be capable of accepting a

§ 13.04.020  PURPOSE.



   A.   A.R.S. § 9-463.01 directs City Councils of municipalities
throughout the state to regulate the subdivision of all lands within their
respective cities so as to establish minimum requirements and standards for
the installation of subdivision streets, sewer and water utilities, and
improvements as a condition of final plat approval.



   B.   The city is committed to ensuring that its growth shall
constitute balanced development which reflects proper consideration of the
range of economic, environmental, fiscal, social, and other issues. The
subdivision of land impacts all of these issues.



   C.   These regulations accommodate growth by considering the need
for services generated by subdivisions along with public ability to provide
and/or private willingness to contribute to the costs of these services.



   D.   The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the orderly
growth and harmonious development of the city; to insure adequate traffic
circulation through coordinated street systems with relation to major
thoroughfares, adjoining subdivisions and public facilities; to achieve
individual property lots of reasonable utility and livability; to secure
adequate provisions for water supply, drainage, sanitary sewerage, and other
health requirements; to insure consideration for adequate sites for schools,
recreation areas and other public facilities; to promote conveyance of land
by accurate legal description; and to provide logical procedures for the
achievement of this purpose.

any ordinances, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued,
and not in conflict with any of the provisions of this title, or which shall
be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of premises and
likewise not in conflict with this title; nor is it intended by this title to
interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties; except that if this title imposes a greater
restriction, this title shall control.

   A.   The pre-application conference stage of subdivision planning
comprises an investigatory period which precedes actual preparation of
preliminary plans by the subdivider. During this stage the subdivider makes
known his or her intentions to the Department and is advised of specific
public objectives related to the subject tract and other details regarding
platting procedures and requirements.



   B.   During this stage it may be determined that change in zoning
would be required for the subject tract or a part thereof, and in such case
the subdivider shall initiate the necessary rezoning application prior to or
in conjunction with the subdivision request.



(Prior Code, § 12-2-2 (part))  (Ord. 08-913, passed 3-11-2008)



§ 13.12.030  PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE—RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES.



   In carrying out the purpose of the pre-application stage, the
subdivider and the Department shall be responsible for the following actions:



   A.   Actions by the subdivider. The subdivider shall meet informally
with the Department to present a general outline of his or her proposal,
including but not limited to:



      1.   Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, street and lot
arrangement, tentative lot sizes;



      2.   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage
disposal, surface drainage and street improvements.



   B.   Actions by the Department. The department will discuss the
proposal with the subdivider and advise him or her of procedural steps,
design and improvement standards, and general plat requirements. Then,
depending upon the scope of the proposed development, the Department will
proceed with the following investigations:



      1.   Check existing zoning of the tract and make
recommendations if a zoning change is necessary or desirable;



      2.   Determine the adequacy of existing or proposed schools,
parks and other public spaces;



      3.   Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship
to major streets, utility systems and adjacent land uses, and to determine
any unusual problems such as topography, utilities, flooding and the like;



      4.   Determine the need for preparation and review of a
development master plan prior to subsequent consideration of a preliminary
plat;



      5.   In consultation with engineering staff, advise the
subdivider if a development master plan is required and to what extent it is
to be prepared by the developer.



      6.   Determine if a specific plan is necessary or desirable.

§ 13.12.050  STAGE II—PRELIMINARY PLAT.



   The preliminary plat stage of land subdivision includes detailed
subdivision planning, submittal, review and approval of the preliminary plat.
To avoid delay in processing his or her application, the subdivider should
carefully provide the Planning Board with all information essential to
determine the character and general acceptability of the proposed
development.  If the subdivider has an approved specific plan for the
subject property, the preliminary plat(s) shall be prepared in accordance
with the specific plan. Preliminary plats may address phases of the overall
specific plan.



   A.   Zoning. The subdivision shall be designed to meet the specific
requirements for the zoning district within which it is located. However, in
the event that change of zoning is deemed necessary, the rezoning shall be
initiated by the property owner or his or her authorized agent, heard and
approved by the Planning Board and Council. The Department shall not proceed
with processing of the preliminary plat until the zoning change has been
filed for. In any event, any change in zoning required in relation to the
preliminary plat shall have been adopted by the City Council prior to or in
conjunction with preliminary plat approval by the City Council.



   B.   Sanitary sewerage and water supply. As a prerequisite of
preliminary plat review by the Department, the subdivider shall have informed
the Public Works Department of his or her tentative plans and learned the

§ 13.16.010  GENERAL.



   A.   Every subdivision shall conform to the goals and objectives
adopted and contained in the Lake Havasu City  general plan. The subdivision
shall also conform to the zoning code and other applicable codes and
ordinances of Lake Havasu City and the Arizona Revised Statutes, where
applicable.



   B.   Where a tract of land to be subdivided contains all or any part
of an area for a park, school, flood-control facility or area shown on the 
general plan or recommended by the Planning Commission , the site shall be
platted showing streets and lots with the area delineated by a bold line and
the purpose of the site designated. An agreement shall be reached between the
developer and the public, agency relative to date, method and cost of the
acquisition within  one year of final  plat approval. If an agreement
cannot be reached between the developer and the public agency relative to
date, method and cost of the acquisition within the  one year period, then
the City Council shall make a determination relative to the compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.



   C.   Land which is subject to periodic flooding, land which cannot
be properly drained, or other land which, in the opinion of the  Flood Plain
Administrator, is unsuitable for subdivision use, shall not be subdivided;
except that the  Commission may approve subdivision of such land upon
receipt of evidence from the city engineer that the construction of specific
improvements can be expected to render the land suitable; thereafter,
construction upon the land shall be prohibited until the specified
improvements have been planned and construction guaranteed.



   D.   Where the tract to be subdivided is located in whole or in part
in terrain having an average cross-slope exceeding 10%, design and
development may, at the discretion of the Department and the City Engineer,
follow the standards and requirements of § 13.16.080 of this chapter.



(Prior Code, § 12-3-1)  (Ord. 08-913, passed 3-11-2008)



§ 13.16.020  STREET LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT.



   A.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a street
designated in the adopted transportation plan, the streets shall be platted
in conformance therewith.



   B.   Whenever a tract to be subdivided is located within an area for
which a  specific plan has been approved by the Planning Commission , the
street arrangement shall conform substantially to the plan.



   C.   Certain proposed streets, as designated by the  City Engineer,
shall be extended to the tract boundary to provide future connection with
adjoining unplatted lands.



   D.   Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use
by through traffic.



   E.   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing
proposed parkway, the  City Engineer may require marginal-access streets or
double-frontage with nonaccess easements along the parkway, or such other
treatment as may be justified for protection of residential properties from
the nuisance and hazard of high volume traffic, and to preserve the traffic
function of the arterial route.



   F.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains the right-of-way of a
railroad, a limited-access high-way, an irrigation canal, or abuts a
commercial or industrial land use, the  City Engineer may recommend location
of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way at
a distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land. The distance
shall be determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges or
future grade separations.



   G.   Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography
as to produce desirable lots of maximum utility and streets of reasonable
gradient, and to facilitate adequate drainage.



   H.   Alleys shall be required in all multifamily residential,
commercial and industrial subdivisions, except that the  City Engineer may
recommend waiver of this requirement in certain residential districts because
of topography, required lot size or in lieu of underground utilities. The 
City Engineer may also recommend the waiver of the requirements in industrial
subdivisions.



   I.   Half streets shall be discouraged except where necessary to
provide right-of-way required by the transportation plan to complete a street
pattern already begun or to ensure reasonable development of a number of
adjoining parcels. Where there exists a platted half street abutting the

than 10 degrees and less than 90 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a minimum centerline radius of 500 feet for collector streets or 100
feet for local streets.



      3.   Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent section
of centerline not less than 100 feet long, unless the radius exceeds 600 feet
on collector streets or 200 feet on local streets, in which cases no tangent
is required.



      4.   Streets intersecting an arterial route shall do so at an
angle which shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than 4r degrees;
intersections of local streets shall not vary from 90 degrees by more than 15

      6.   Minor streets intersecting a collector street or arterial
route shall have a tangent section of centerline at least 150 feet in length
measured from the right-of-way line of the major street. No such tangent is
required when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater than 400
feet with the corner located on the major street right-of-way line. Where
topographic conditions make necessary other treatment to secure the best
overall design, these standards may be relaxed by the city staff.



      7.   Street intersections with more than 4 legs and "Y" type
intersections where legs meet at acute angles shall be avoided.

problems, abrupt changes in land use or heavy traffic on adjacent streets
prevail, the  Director may make special lot width, depth and area
requirements which exceed the minimum requirements of the particular zoning
district.



   B.   Proposed streets shall be arranged in close relation to
existing topography. Where steep topography prevails, as in the platting of
hillside subdivisions, and where street grades must of necessity reach or
exceed these standard maximums, the requirements of § 13.16.080 maybe
followed.



   C.   The depth-to-width ratio of the usable area of the lot shall
not be greater than 2 to 1, except as topography warrants exception.



   D.   Minimum front building lines shall conform to the minimum
requirements of the zoning code.

crosses the tract, dedication of a public drainage easement, of a width
sufficient to permit widening, deepening, relocating or protecting said
watercourse, shall be required.



   C.   Land within a public street, drainage easement or land within a
utility easement for major power transmission (tower) lines or pipelines
shall not be considered a part of the minimum required lot area except where
lots exceed ½ acre in area. This shall not be construed as applicable to
land involved in utility easements for distribution or service purposes.



   D.   Except where alleys are provided, lots arranged with rear of
lot to major streets, railroads, canals or commercial or industrial
districts, as required in § 13.16.020E and F, shall have a minimum lot depth

§ 13.16.080  HILLSIDE SUBDIVISIONS.



   Planning, platting and development of hillside subdivisions involve
special problems and require special handling by the subdivider and his or
her Engineer, and by the Subdivision Committee, staff and reviewing
officials. These problems are preservation of scenic beauty for the benefit
of the general public, safe construction of public improvements commensurate
with lower density and lesser public use, and safe construction of private
improvements related to sewage disposal, water supply, storm drainage and,
foundation bearing.



   A.   Lot width and area. Lot width and area shall be closely related
to the terrain, drainage, percolation factors or construction of sanitary
sewers, with emphasis placed on selection of homesites and the access to the
homesites.



   B.   Special design standards for hillside subdivisions.



      1.   Street grades shall not exceed 15%.

difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or
the purpose of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve exception to these subdivision
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that such exception shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the City
Council shall not approve exceptions unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:



   A.   The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;



   B.   The conditions upon which the request for an exception is based
are unique to the property for which the exception is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;



   C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and



   D.   The exception will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, approved Specific Plan, or the General Plan.

contained in these regulations.



      4.   No building permit shall be issued for the construction
of any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in

§ 14.01.01  TITLE.



   Title 14 of the Lake Havasu City Municipal Code is and may be cited as
the Lake Havasu City Development Code, or referred to as the “Development
Code,” or “Code.”



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.02  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this Development Code is to implement the policies of
the Lake Havasu City General Plan by classifying and regulating the uses of
land and structures within Lake Havasu City.  In addition, this Development
Code is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of residents, and preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality
of the city.  To fulfill these purposes, it is the intent of this
Development Code to:



   A.   Implement the uses of land designated by the updated Lake
Havasu City General Plan and avoid conflicts between land uses;



   B.   Provide standards for the orderly growth and development of the
city, and promote a stable pattern of land uses;



   C.   Maintain and protect the value of property;



   D.   Further the development of business and tourism industries;



   E.   Conserve and protect the open space, scenic beauty and other
natural resources of the city; while also promoting recreational land uses;



   F.   Protect the character, and social and economic stability of
residential, commercial and industrial areas; and



   G.   Assist in maintaining a high quality of life without causing
unduly high public or private costs for development or unduly restricting
private enterprise, initiative or innovation in design.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.03  AUTHORITY.



   This Development Code is enacted based on the authority vested in Lake
Havasu City by the State of Arizona, including but not limited to the Arizona
State Constitution and Planning and Zoning Law.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.04  EFFECTIVE DATE.



   The effective date of this Development Code (“effective date”) is
March 24, 2016.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.05  APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.



   A.   This Development Code applies to all land uses, subdivisions
and development within Lake Havasu City unless specifically exempted by
specific sections of this Code.



   B.   The provisions of this Development Code shall be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare.  When this Development Code provides for discretion on the part of
a city official or body, that discretion may be exercised to impose more
stringent requirements than identified in this Development Code, as may be
necessary to promote orderly land use and development, environmental resource
protection, and the other purposes of this Development Code.



   C.   Except as may be otherwise provided by this article for a
specific overlay district:



      1.   Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning
district by this Code may be allowed within an overlay district, subject to
any additional requirements of the overlay district;



      2.   Development and new land uses within an overlay district
shall obtain the zoning approvals required by this Code for the primary
zoning district; and



      3.   Development and new land uses within an overlay district
shall comply with all applicable development standards of the primary zoning
district and all other applicable provisions of this Development Code.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.06  ZONING MAP.



   Lake Havasu City shall be divided into zoning districts that implement
the city’s General Plan.  The zoning districts, identified in Article II,
shall be shown on the Zoning Map.  The Lake Havasu City Zoning Map
(“Zoning Map”) is incorporated by reference into this Code.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.07  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.



   A.   New and changed land uses or structures.  It is unlawful for
any person to establish, construct, reconstruct, alter or replace any use of
land or structure, except in compliance with the requirements of this
Development Code, unless compliance is not required by § 14.05.05.



   B.   Subdivision of land.  Any subdivision of land proposed after
the effective date of this Development Code shall be consistent with the
minimum lot size and dimension requirements and all other applicable
requirements of this Development Code.



   C.   Other requirements may apply.  Nothing in this Development
Code eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the
city, or any permit, approval or entitlement required by the regulations of
any regional, state or federal agency.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.08  NUISANCES PROHIBITED.



   Any structure or use that is altered, changed, constructed, converted,
enlarged, erected, established, installed, maintained, moved, operated, or
used contrary to the provisions of this Development Code or any applicable
condition of approval imposed on a permit, is hereby declared to be unlawful
and a public nuisance, and shall also be subject to the remedies and
penalties identified in this chapter and Chapter 8.08 (Nuisances) of the
Municipal Code.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.09  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS.



   A.   Conflicting requirements.  If conflicts occur between
requirements of this Development Code, or between this Development Code, the
Lake Havasu City Municipal Code or other regulations of the city, the most
restrictive provision shall apply.



   B.   State law requirements.  Where this Development Code
references applicable provisions of state law, the reference shall be
construed to be to the applicable state law provisions as they may be amended
from time to time.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.10  RELATIONSHIP TO THIRD-PARTY PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.



   This Development Code applies to all land uses and development
regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the
development or use of structures or land than a private agreement or
restriction, without affecting the applicability of any agreement or
restriction.  The city shall not enforce any private covenant or agreement
unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.11  INTERPRETATION.



   A.   General.



      1.   The Zoning Administrator has the authority to interpret
any provision of this Development Code.  Interpretation of this Code
includes clarification of intention and procedure, and determination of
unspecified land uses and uncertainties pertaining to the Zoning Map.



   B.   Permitted uses.



      1.   Interpretation also includes determinations as to whether
a use of land is permitted by this Development Code. If a proposed use of
land is not specifically listed in Article II (Zoning Districts), the use
shall only be permitted if the  Zoning Administrator makes the following
determinations:



         a.   The characteristics of, and activities associated
with, the proposed use are equivalent to those of 1 or more of the uses
listed in the zoning district as allowable, and would not involve a higher
level of activity or population density than the uses listed in the district;



         b.   The proposed use would meet the purpose/intent of
the zoning district that is applied to the subject site; and



         c.   The proposed use would be consistent with the goals
and policies of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.



      2.   If the Zoning Administrator determines that an unlisted
use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use shall be treated in the
same manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what
permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this
Development Code would apply.



   C.   Zoning Map.  Uncertainties regarding the location of a zoning
district boundary on the Zoning Map shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator as follows:



      1.   If a district boundary approximately follows a lot,
alley, or street line, this line shall be construed as the district boundary;



      2.   If a district boundary divides a lot and the boundary
line location is not specified by distances on the Zoning Map, the location
of the boundary will be determined using the Zoning Map scale; and



      3.   If a public street or alley is officially vacated or
abandoned, the land that was formerly in the street or alley will be included
within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the
centerline of the vacated or abandoned street or alley.



   D.   Referral. Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that the
meaning or applicability of any Development Code requirement is subject to
interpretation, the Zoning Administrator may issue an official
interpretation, or may refer any issue of interpretation to the Board of
Adjustment for its determination.



   E.   Procedure.  A request for an interpretation or determination
of the meaning or applicability of any of the requirements of this
Development Code shall be made in compliance with Article V (Procedures and
Enforcement).



(Ord. 16-1411, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.01.12  TRANSITION TO THIS CODE.



   A.   An application for a permit or approval that has been accepted
by the Department as complete prior to the effective date or any amendment
shall be processed in compliance with the requirements in effect when the
application was accepted as complete.  Minor changes to applications in this
category may also be processed pursuant to § 14.05.03N. in compliance with
the requirements in effect when the application was accepted as complete, but
major changes to applications in this category shall be processed pursuant to
§ 14.05.03N. in compliance with this Development Code.



   B.   An application for a permit or approval that has not been
accepted by the Department as complete prior to the effective date, or that
is submitted after the effective date, shall be processed in compliance with
the requirements of this Development Code.  Minor and major changes to
applications in this category shall also be processed pursuant to §
14.05.03N. in compliance with the requirements of this Development Code.

ARTICLE II:  ZONING DISTRICTS



§ 14.02.01  ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.



   The base and overlay zoning districts in the current zoning districts
column of Table 2-1 are hereby created.  These districts shall have the
boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map maintained in electronic form by
the Community Investment Department and available on the Lake Havasu City
website.  The base zoning districts are grouped into 3 types —
residential, mixed use, and special purpose.



   Each of the base zoning districts listed in Table 2-1 are described
below.  Each section includes a purpose statement, basic dimensional table,
examples of development in that district, and an illustration, as well as any
regulations that apply to only that district.  Permitted uses for each
district are located in Article III, and development standards applicable to
all development are located in Article IV.

§ 14.02.03  RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.



   A.   R-A:  Residential Agricultural.



      1.   Purpose. This district is intended to provide for
semi-rural, low-density, residential development and agricultural uses, in
more isolated areas.  The 1 acre minimum lot size and 1 dwellings/acre
maximum density standards restrict urban development.  Designs that retain
the visual character and appeal of the desert landscape are encouraged.  To
foster the dual purposes of this district, principal land uses include
single-family and 2-family dwellings as well as agricultural and animal
related uses, plant nurseries and garden supply stores, and community
gardens, as provided in Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table). This district may
serve as a transition between strictly residential and strictly agricultural
land uses.

large-lot, single-family residential development along a golf course, or
centered around other recreational or open space uses.  To encourage this
recreational component, in addition to single-family dwellings, principal
land uses include golf courses, parks and playgrounds, and community gardens,
as provided in Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table).

preserve Lake Havasu City’s most predominant land use – single-family
homes on individual lots – in safe and attractive community settings. 
Primary land uses include single-family detached and attached homes and
public or community oriented land uses such as schools, day care facilities,
parks, and community gardens, as provided in Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table).

   H.   A-P:  Agriculture–Preservation.



      1.   Purpose.  This unique district applies to most of the
land bounding the city on the northwest, north, and east sides, most of which
is owned or regulated by a state or federal government agency. The intent of
this district is to permit all uses required by state law and to encourage
uses of those lands that are consistent with the city’s General Plan. The
district serves multiple purposes, including:



         •   Accommodating agricultural activities in more
remote areas to reduce potential impacts on more urban development.



         •   Facilitating rural to urban transitions in a
planned and orderly manner consistent with the environmentally sound and
efficient extension of urban services.



         •   Making the city’s natural, historic, and
recreational resources publicly accessible from well-placed access easements.




•   Increasing active or passive park, trail, or other recreational uses.




         •   Promoting creative and context sensitive site and
building designs that conserve and accentuate the natural landscape.



The principal land uses are agriculture, open space and parks, and outdoor
recreation, as provided in Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table).

§ 14.02.06  OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS.



   A.   Purpose and applicability.



      1.   This section regulates development and redevelopment in
those overlay zoning districts established by § 14.02.01, and having the
boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map.



      2.   An overlay district is distinguished from a base zoning
district by an “O” as the last letter in the zone district designation.



      3.   The provisions of each overlay zoning district supplement
or modify the standards and requirements of the underlying base zoning
district.



      4.   In case of a conflict between the provisions of the
overlay zone district and an underlying base zoning district, the provisions
of the overlay zoning district shall apply, regardless of whether they are
more or less restrictive than the provisions of the base zoning district.



      5.   If a property is included in 2 or more overlay districts,
and the provisions of 1 or more overlay districts conflict, the more
restrictive overlay district provision shall apply.



   B.   AP-O:  Airport Overlay.



      1.   Airport zones.  This district establishes certain zones
that include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces,
transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply
to Lake Havasu City Municipal Airport.  These zones are shown on the Lake
Havasu City Municipal Airport Approach Plan and Zoning Map consisting of 1
sheet, prepared as part of the Lake Havasu City Municipal Airport Master
Plan, dated January, 1986, which is hereby incorporated into this section by
reference as though it were fully set forth here. An area located in more
than 1 of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the
more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are established and
defined as follows:



         a.   Utility runway visual approach zone. The inner edge
of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.



         b.   Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach
zone.  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from
the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of
the runway.



         c.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility
minimum greater than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone.  The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to
a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.



         d.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility
minimum as low as 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone-precision
runway.  The inner-edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of
the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward
uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet
from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the
centerline of the runway.



         e.   Precision instrument runway approach zone.  The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly
to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the
primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.



         f.   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the
areas beneath the transitional surfaces.



         g.   Horizontal zone.  The horizontal zone is
established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runway designated
utility or visual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end
of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by
drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the
approach and transitional zones.



         h.   Conical zone.  The conical zone is established as
the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.



      2.   Airport zone height limitations.



         a.   Established.  Except as otherwise provided in this
section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree
shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this section, to a height in
excess of the applicable height established in this section for the zone.
Height limitations are established for each of the zones in question as
follows:



            i.   Utility runway visual approach zone.  Slopes
20 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



            ii.   Runway larger than utility with a visibility
minimum greater than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone.  Slopes
34 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



            iii.   Runway larger than utility with visibility
minimum greater than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone-precision
runway.  Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end
of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



            iv.   Precision instrument runway approach zone. 
Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward, beginning at the end of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes
upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional
horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.



            v.   Transitional zones.  Slopes 7 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as
the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of
150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are
established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and
extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision
instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are
established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward,
beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and
extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to
the extended runway centerline.



            vi.   Horizontal zone.  Established at 150 feet
above the airport elevation or at a height of 933 feet above mean sea level.



            viii.   Conical zone.  Slopes 20 feet outward for
each foot upward, beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at
150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 150 feet
above the airport elevation.



      3.   Use restriction.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone
established by this section in a manner so as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals, or radio communication between the
airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike
hazards, or otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.



      4.   Nonconforming uses.



         a.   Regulations not retroactive.  The regulations
prescribed in this section shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of October 26, 1988, the effective date of
this Airport Overlay District, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of
a nonconforming use.  Nothing contained in this section shall require any
change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to October 26, 1988, and
is diligently constructed.



         b.   Marking and lighting.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of division B.4.a., the owner of any existing nonconforming
structure or tree is required to install, operate, and maintain thereon
appropriate markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Public
Works Director to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of
the airport the presence of the airport obstruction.



   C.   NK-O:  North Kiowa Overlay.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to regulate
commercial development along North Kiowa Boulevard between Catalina Drive and
Havasupai Boulevard in order to protect the public interest in achieving
distinctive and internally consistent architectural and site design elements.

properties in compliance with § 14.04.05 (Exterior Lighting).



         d.   The lighting fixtures shall be located only in
landscape areas and may not be installed in the open paving of the parking
lot.



         e.   One area lighting fixture shall be installed for
each lot in the required landscape area as designated on the typical
parking-in-common plan.



   D.   PD-O:  Planned Development Overlay.



      1.   Purpose.



         a.   A Planned Development Overlay (PD-O) is a
development in which structures, land use, open space, transportation
facilities, and utility systems are integrated through an overall design
concept on a single parcel or aggregate parcels of land approved by City
Council.



         b.   City review is accomplished by combining
subdivision, conditional use, and design review into a single process
designed to provide a framework for the development of a more desirable urban
environment through application of contemporary site planning techniques and
architectural forms.



         c.   The Planned Development process is aimed at
permitting creativity and flexibility in site design that may not be achieved
through a strict adherence to zoning district and subdivision standards
applicable to the base zoning district.



         d.   The PD-O District is intended to encourage
efficient use of land and resources that can result in savings to the
community, consumers, and developers; preserve valuable landscape, terrain,
and other environmental amenities; and provide diverse and innovative living,
working, or shopping environments that consider community needs and activity
patterns.



      2.   Applicability.  In accordance with the requirements of
this Code, the PD-O Zoning District can be applied to any parcels.



      3.   Permitted uses.  In a PD-O District, any land uses
allowed in the Permitted Use Table (Table 3-1) in § 14.03.01 may be
permitted if they can be shown to provide an orderly relation and function to
other uses in the development and to existing land uses and is consistent
with the approved General Plan. The permitted uses of property located in the
PD-O shall be determined at the time the zoning overlay district and
development plan are approved, and development within the district shall be
limited to those uses specifically approved in those documents. Any addition
of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density shall require a
separate application for amendment to the original approved PD-O and shall
follow the same process as any other zoning ordinance amendment, unless they
qualify as a minor change under § 14.05.03(N) (Changes to Approved Projects).



      4.   Guidelines for design.  The following principles for
proposing and mixing land uses are recommended:



         a.   The proposed development shall be designed so as to
produce an environment of stable and desirable character not out of harmony
with its surrounding neighborhood.



         b.   Personal and individual privacy shall be maintained
and balanced with the provision of public and common areas.



         c.   Interest and variety within the development shall
be sought by means of street design and changes in and mixtures of building
types, heights, facades, setbacks, planting, or size of open space, and the
design shall be harmonious as a whole and not simply from street to street.



         d.   Natural amenities of the land shall be preserved
through maintenance of conservation areas and open spaces. A minimum of at
least 20% of the gross area of the site shall be retained in open space.



         e.   Building heights shall be consistent with the
reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property and the efficiency of existing
public services and facilities.



         f.   Within a primarily residential development,
commercial and office uses, if proposed, shall be scaled and integrated into
the overall design. Commercial and office uses within the development shall
be along the street of the development and be accessed by an arterial or
collector road when possible.



         g.   Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of
the development shall be permanently screened in a manner that sufficiently
protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent, existing and proposed
uses.



      5.   Dimensional standards.



         a.   This Code does not establish minimum lot sizes,
minimum lot widths, maximum lot coverage, minimum yards and building
setbacks, or minimum/maximum height requirements for properties in PD-O
Zoning Districts. Dimensional requirements shall be approved in the PD-O
rezoning ordinance and general development plan.



         b.   Maximum structure height may exceed those of the
underlying base zoning district to a maximum height of 60 feet, or 90 feet in
the Channel Riverwalk Zoning District, except that the Black Rock Preserve
area is not eligible for a height exception. Structures within 100 feet of
the R-1, R-2, R-E and R-A zones shall be limited to the maximum height
allowed in the underlying base zoning district.



      6.   Density.  This Code does not establish minimum
residential density or non-residential development intensity in PD-O Zoning
Districts. Maximum numbers of dwelling units and/or building gross square
footage shall be approved in the PD-O rezoning ordinance and general
development plan.

ARTICLE III:  PERMITTED USES



§ 14.03.01  GENERAL–USING THE PERMITTED USE TABLE.



   Table 3-1 (Permitted Use Table) lists each land use available in the
city and indicates whether it is allowed by right, with a conditional use
permit, as an accessory or temporary use, or prohibited, in each base zoning
district.  References to additional regulations (i.e., use-specific
standards) applicable to a certain land use are also included in the right
hand column.  Other property uses or restrictions on uses may be contained
in the city’s base or overlay zoning district regulations in Article II
(Zoning Districts).  If a property is located in a PD-O (Planned Development
Overlay) district, the permitted uses, conditional use, and any conditions on
those uses are contained in the rezoning ordinance and related documents for
that property.



   A.   Permitted uses.  A “P” in a cell of the Permitted Use
Table indicates that the land use is allowed by right in that zoning
district, subject to compliance with the use-specific standards referenced in
the right hand column for that use.



   B.   Conditional uses.  A “C” in a cell of the Permitted Use
Table indicates that the land use is allowed in that zoning district only
upon approval of a conditional use permit as described in § 14.05.04G. and
subject to compliance with any use-specific standards referenced in the right
hand column for that use.



   C.   Prohibited uses.  A blank cell in the Permitted Use Table
indicates that the land use is prohibited in that zoning district.



   D.   Accessory uses.  An “A” in a cell of the Permitted Use
Table indicates that the land use is allowed in that zoning district only if
it is incidental and subordinate to a permitted primary use of the land in
that district (i.e., a P or C use that has been approved for the site).



   E.   Temporary uses.  A “T” in a cell of the Permitted Use
Table indicates that the use is permitted in that zoning district for a
temporary amount of time and only after approval of a temporary use permit
(§ 14.05.04F.) and subject to compliance with any use-specific standards
referenced in the right hand column for that use.



   F.   Overlay district provisions govern.  When a property is
located within the boundaries of 1 or more of the overlay districts listed in
§ 14.02.06, the provisions for that overlay district prevail over those in
the base zoning district.  For example, if a use is prohibited in the base
zoning district where the property is located, but is a permitted use in an
overlay district applicable to the same property, then the use is allowed on
that property.  On the other hand, if a use is listed as a permitted use in
the base zoning district but is listed as a conditional use in an overlay
zoning district applicable to the same property, then the use is a
conditional use for that property.  Where a property is located in more than
one overlay district, then the most restrictive use provision in those
overlay zoning districts shall apply to the property.



   G.   Use-specific standards.  When a land use is allowed in a
zoning district, there may be additional standards that apply to that
specific use.  Those additional standards (use-specific standards) are
cross-referenced in the right hand column of the Permitted Use Table.  These
cross-referenced standards appear in § 14.03.03 immediately following the
Permitted Use Table.



   H.   Unlisted uses.  When a proposed land use is not explicitly
listed in the Permitted Use Table, the Zoning Administrator shall determine
whether or not it is included in the definition of a listed use or is so
consistent with the size, scale, operating characteristics and external
impacts of a listed use that it should be treated as the same use. Any such
interpretation shall be made available to the public and shall be binding on
future decisions of the city until the Director makes a different
interpretation or this Development Code is amended to treat the use
differently.



   I.   Licences and permits required.  All uses required by the State
of Arizona or the federal government to have an approval, license, or permit
to operate, issued by the state or by another public, quasi-public, or
regulatory agency, are required by Lake Havasu City to obtain and maintain
that state approval, license, or permit at all times.  Failure to do so
constitutes a violation of this Code.

licensing and certification requirements.



      4.   Golf course.  This land use is subject to the following
barrier standards for the purpose of protecting residential homes adjacent to
a golf course from the adverse visual impacts that a poorly designed golf
course protective barrier may have on surrounding land uses.



         a.   Location.  A protective barrier shall only be
located on lots immediately adjacent to a golf course.



         b.   Setbacks.  No setbacks required. Protective
barriers may be located on the property line, but shall not encroach onto
adjoining properties.



         c.   Design standards.



            i.   Wooden poles, natural vegetation, or steel

         e.   Building permits.  A building permit shall be
required for any protective barrier if required by the adopted Building Code.



      5.   Hospital.  In the C-CHD District this use shall be 100
feet in height (maximum).



      6.   Open space, park, or playground.  In the MU-CRW, I-B,
and A-P Districts, open space corridors shall be maintained to the greatest
extent practicable to provide safe and convenient public access along the
lake and from city rights-of-way to the lake.



      7.   Water-related facilities.



         a.   In the MU-CRW and I-B Districts, water-related
facilities shall be:



            i.   Set back 50 feet from the vertical face of
London Bridge, and 35 feet from projecting bridge supports.



            ii.   Constructed from all-weather durable
materials and maintained in a safe condition.



            iii.   Attached to pilings in compliance with the
adopted Building Code, as necessary.



            iv.   Be similar in appearance, including
materials and façade articulation, with the color and design of surrounding
structures, to the greatest extent practicable.



         b.   On the Island, this use must be accessory to a
permitted or approved conditional use.



      8.   Public utility facilities, minor.



         a.   Underground requirement.  Minor utilities that
provide direct service to a property shall be installed underground. The
developer or owner shall be responsible for complying with this requirement
and making the necessary arrangements with the utility companies for
installation of necessary facilities, unless the Commission or Council waives
this requirement when approving a development project.



         b.   Residential exemption.  This requirement does not
apply to residential structures constructed within the A-P, R-A, R-E, R-1,
R-2, or RMH Zoning Districts.



         c.   Aboveground exceptions.  For the purposes of this
section, appurtenances and associated equipment may be placed aboveground.
These appurtenances shall not be placed in required front or side yard
setbacks and shall be adequately screened to prevent visibility from the
street.



      9.   Telecommunications facilities.



         a.   Purpose.  It is the intent of these standards to
regulate the placement, construction, and modification of towers and
telecommunications facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public, while not unreasonably interfering with the
development of the competitive wireless communications marketplace in the
city and to comply with federal and state legislation regarding
telecommunications facilities.  This is done by:



            i.   Protecting residential areas and land uses
from potential adverse impact of the facilities and towers;



            ii.   Minimizing adverse visual impacts of towers
through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;



            iii.   Promoting and encouraging shared
use/collocation of towers and antenna support structures as a primary option
rather than construction of additional single-use towers;



            iv.   Promoting and encouraging the use of
technology that either eliminates or reduces the need for new tower
structures;



            v.   Avoiding potential property damage from a
tower by ensuring that tower structures are soundly and carefully designed,
constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or found
to be structurally unsound;



            vi.   Ensuring that towers are compatible with
surrounding land uses; and



            vii.   Complying with the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, and related regulations promulgated by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), as amended and interpreted by the federal courts.



         b.   Permitting required.



            i.   Existing telecommunications facilities.



               (A)   Requests for collocation, removal, or
replacement, or eligible facilities requests, as defined in this Code and
under federal law, for a modification of an existing wireless
telecommunications facility that does not substantially change the physical
dimension of the facility shall be granted.



               (B)   An applicant shall file an eligible
facilities request with the Community Development Department demonstrating
that the proposed modification will not substantially change the physical
dimensions of the facility, as the term “substantial change” is defined
in federal laws and regulations.



               (C)   The Community Development Department
shall determine whether the application constitutes an eligible facilities
request, and grant the request within 60 days.  Applications for
collocations that do not qualify as eligible facilities requests shall be
granted within 90 days.  These review periods include the review for
determining whether the application is complete.  This timeframe may be
extended by mutual agreement or if the city informs the applicant in timely
manner that the application is incomplete.



            ii.   New telecommunications facilities.  All new
freestanding telecommunication towers shall require the approval of a
conditional use permit by the Commission, except telecommunications
facilities of 1 meter in diameter or less, in any zoning district, and
facilities of 2 meters in diameter or less in commercial and industrial
districts, which are permitted by right. The application for a conditional
use permit for a freestanding tower shall include the following information:



               (A)   Technical documentation that a new
telecommunications facility is required to provide service and that the
collocation of facilities on an existing structure is not technically
feasible.



               (B)   If the proposed facility will exceed
the height limit of the underlying zoning district, technical documentation
must be provided explaining the reason for the requested height, and that no
other alternative is technically feasible.



               (C)   To eliminate attempts to gain approval
of telecommunications facilities based on speculation, applicants for
proposed facilities shall provide affidavit of intended lease or use from a
cellular provider at the time an application is submitted.



               (D)   The Commission shall decide a
conditional use permit request for a new wireless telecommunications facility
150 days from the time the application is received unless this time period
has been mutually extended or tolled because the applicant was informed,
within 30 days of submitting the application, that it is incomplete.



               (E)   Failure to demonstrate that the
criteria in divisions B.9.b.ii.(A) and B.9.b.ii.(B) above are true shall be
considered grounds for disapproval of a conditional use permit application.



         c.   Development standards.



            i.   General.



               (A)   Telecommunications facilities are
subject to any applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) standards.



               (B)   Telecommunications facilities shall
meet the dimensional criteria of the underlying zoning district unless varied

[2]   Garages, carports, or any structure used to park vehicles that face
a front yard right-of-way must be set back a minimum of 25 feet. On a reverse
corner lot, the front yard is defined by the shorter of the two street
frontages, but a 25- foot garage setback is required from any “front” or
“side” street right-of-way that the lot’s parking structure faces.

[3]   A lot with an average depth of 100 feet or less may maintain a
20-foot front yard setback for a garage.

[4]   A lot with an average width of 80 feet or less may have a side yard
of 5 feet, or 10 feet if it is a corner lot.

[5]   If a garage is to be accessed from a corner lot with a street side
setback, the minimum setback for the garage shall be 20 feet, regardless of
the minimum setback identified in this table.

[6]   Detached accessory structures may be built within 5 feet of the side
and rear property lines.

[7]   Accessory buildings are limited to garages and must be located in
the rear of the primary structure. Garages may not face the street.

§ 14.04.02  PARKING AND LOADING.



   A.   Purpose and applicability.  It is the intent of this section
to provide adequate parking and loading facilities to prevent street and
traffic congestion while allowing for efficient use of land. The standards of
this section shall apply to all development and redevelopment unless
specifically excepted or modified by another provision of this Code.



   B.   Exceptions and exemptions.



      1.   Change in permitted use or structure.



         a.   Whenever the use of a property is changed to a new
type of permitted or conditional use, parking and loading spaces required for
the new use shall be provided in compliance with this section.



         b.   Whenever a structure is enlarged resulting in a net
increase of gross floor area, seating capacity, dwelling units, or any other
unit of measurement used to determine the required number of parking spaces,
parking and loading spaces for the additional capacity shall be provided in
compliance with this section.



         c.   Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions B.1.a.
and B.1.b. above, a permitted use that does not meet the parking requirements
of this section may be converted to another permitted use without full
compliance with the required number of parking spaces provided:



            i.   The amount of parking available is at least
75% of the parking required for the new use in Table 4.02-1; and



            ii.   The applicant provides the maximum number of
parking spaces able to be accommodated on the site while complying with all
other provisions of this Code and without being required to remove or
partially remove an existing structure.



      2.   Small non-residential lots.  No off-street parking shall
be required for any non-residential primary use on a lot in any mixed use
district that is smaller than 5,000 square feet where no portion of the front
lot line is located within 100 feet of a residential district.



      3.   Planned development.



         a.   The off-street parking requirements of this section
shall serve as the standard from which to request different parking
requirements for a PD-O (Planned Development Overlay) District.



         b.   Following approval of a PD-O District and general
development plan, the parking requirements in those documents shall apply
instead of the parking requirements in this section.



         c.   If an approved PD-O Zoning District general
development plan or site plan is silent on any aspect of parking addressed by
this section, the provisions of this section shall apply to that aspect of
parking.



      4.   Parking-in-common.



         a.   Development and redevelopment of lots subject to a
parking-in-common agreement, on the effective date of this Code, shall comply
with the terms of that agreement instead of the parking requirements in this
section. A list of parking-in-common agreements known to the city, and the
properties included in those agreements, is available from the Department.



         b.   The off-street parking requirements of this section
shall serve as the standard from which to request different parking
requirements for parking-in-common areas existing on the effective date of
this Code, or for the creation of a new parking-in-common agreement after the
effective date of this Code.



         c.   Owners of properties subject to an existing
parking-in-common agreement may not physically separate or bar access to any
part of the parking-in-common area in a manner not permitted by the
parking-in-common agreement unless the owner first obtains modifies that
agreement pursuant to § 14.05.04I.



   C.   Parking requirements.



      1.   Required parking spaces.



         a.   The minimum off-street parking requirements for the
uses allowed by this Code are listed in Table 4.02-1.



         b.   When calculating parking spaces, requirements for a
fraction of a parking space shall be ignored.



         c.   A reduction in the minimum off-street parking
requirements may be permitted in accordance with division O. below.



         d.   For any uses not listed in Table 4.02-1, the
required minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be determined by
the Zoning Administrator based on parking requirements for similar uses and
any anticipated neighborhood and traffic congestion impacts.



      2.   Accessible parking.  Within the requirements of Table
4.02-1, accessible parking shall be provided for all multi-family and
non-residential uses as required by the City Building Code and the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).



      3.   Mixed uses.  Where several uses occupy a single
structure or parcel of land, the total requirement for off-street parking and
loading shall be calculated based on division O.1.b. below.

   D.   Parking alternatives.  In mixed-use and non-residential zoning
districts, the Zoning Administrator may approve applications containing
alternatives to the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table
4.02-1, if the application meets the following standards.



      1.   Shared parking.



         a.   Location.  Shared parking shall be located within
600 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served.



         b.   Reduction.  Where a shared parking area or
facility meets the location requirement of division D.1.a. above, the
off-site parking required for those uses may be reduced by the factors shown
in Table 4.02-2. Off-street parking required shall be the sum of the 2
parking requirements for the 2 uses divided by the factors for that
combination of uses.  If more than 2 uses share a parking lot or structure,
the required parking shall be calculated by applying Table 4.02-2 to the 2
uses with the largest parking requirements and then adding the required
parking for the additional uses.

         c.   Other sharing permitted.  As an alternative to the
parking reduction factors in Table 4.02-2, the Zoning Administrator may allow
the following reductions in required parking:



            i.   Up to 50% of the parking spaces required for
food, beverage, and indoor entertainment uses located within 600 feet of a
non-residential use that is not normally open, used, or operated during the
same hours; and



            ii.   Up to 100% of parking spaces required for
religious assembly uses located within 600 feet of a non-residential use that
is not normally open, used, or operated during the same hours.



         d.   Agreements.  If the Zoning Administrator
determines that there is significant doubt that shared parking facilities
will remain available for the uses they serve, and the loss of those shared
parking spaces would cause significant neighborhood impacts or traffic
congestion, the Zoning Administrator may require a written agreement assuring
the continued availability of the shared parking spaces for the uses they
serve. If required by the Zoning Administrator, the agreement shall be on a
form approved by the city and shall be filed with the application for a
building permit.



      2.   Bicycle facilities. Any parking lot or structure
containing 10 or more parking spaces shall provide adequate and safe on-site
bicycle parking facilities in accordance with the following standards:



         a.   For parking lots required to have more than 25
vehicle parking spaces, the required number of vehicle parking spaces may be
reduced by 1 space for each required bicycle parking space installed, up to a
maximum 20% reduction of the number of required vehicle parking spaces.



         b.   Design.



            i.   Location.  Bicycle parking facilities shall
be:



               (A)   Located near the main customer and
employee entrances to the principal use;



               (B)   Clearly designated;



               (C)   Safely separated from vehicle
maneuvering areas, and



               (D)   Located on the ground level when in a
parking structure.



            ii.   Minimum dimensional standards.  Each
bicycle parking space shall be at least:



               (A)   Six feet long;



               (B)   Two feet wide; and



               (C)   A minimum 5-foot wide access aisle is
required beside or between each row of bicycle racks.



            iii.   Materials.  Bicycle parking facilities
shall be surfaced with all-weather material and maintained in a safe and neat
condition that avoids dust.



            iv.   Security.  Bicycle parking facilities shall
be equipped with either a lockable enclosure (bicycle locker) or a permanent,
secure, and stationary structure (bicycle rack) that supports the bicycle
frame and to which the frame and both bicycle wheels can be locked.



      3.   Credit for motorcycle parking.



         a.   The Zoning Administrator may credit parking spaces
for motorcycles or other small motorized vehicles against required off-street
parking requirements in an amount of up to 5% of the standard vehicle spaces
required.



      4.   Credit for public parking.  Some or all of the required
off-street parking spaces for a non-residential use may be waived by the
Zoning Administrator if publicly owned off-street parking is located within a
600 foot walking distance from the main entrance of the proposed use, and the
Zoning Administrator also determines that adequate parking spaces are
available within the publicly owned parking area to accommodate the
anticipated use. 



      5.   Credit for on-street parking.  The Zoning Administrator
may credit on-street parking spaces against required off-street parking
requirements if the on-street spaces are located within 600 feet of an entry
of the building in which the use is located, if the Zoning Administrator
determines that those parking spaces are frequently available for residents,
patrons, or employees of the proposed use and structure.



      6.   Additional parking reductions.  The Zoning Administrator
may allow an additional reduction in the required number of parking spaces if
the applicant submits a parking demand study, prepared in accordance with the
city’s guidelines, by a qualified parking or traffic consultant,
documenting the basis for granting a reduced number of spaces, and the Zoning
Administrator determines the study accurately reflects the parking demand for
the use or structure.



   E.   Parking design standards.  In mixed-use and special purpose
districts, parking area and facility designs shall comply with the following
standards:



      1.   Parking layout dimensions.



         a.   Standard spaces.  All required parking spaces must
be a minimum of 9 feet in width by 18.5 feet in length and must comply with
the minimum dimensions for spaces and aisles shown in the following Table
4.02-4 and Figure 4.02-1.

vehicle, boat, or trailer shall be improved with asphalt or concrete
surfaces, or an alternate paving material approved by the Zoning
Administrator.



         b.   Pervious or semi-pervious parking area surfacing
materials may be approved alternatives, if the Zoning Administrator
determines that they are appropriate for the city’s climate and the
durability required for their intended use.  Permitted materials may
include, but are not limited to grass, mulch, “grasscrete,” ring and grid
systems used in conjunction with grass seed or sod, permeable concrete or

(Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.04.04  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.



   A.   Purpose.  The intent of this section is to:



      1.   Lessen the environmental impacts of the built environment
on the city’s natural resources;



      2.   Establish healthy environmental conditions by providing
shade, air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, less
stormwater runoff, erosion control, and noise, glare, and heat abatement;



      3.   Provide visual buffering from streets, buffering of
potentially incompatible land uses, and enhanced quality and appearance of a
development site, and the city in general;



      4.   Where landscaping is required, the installed materials
should include live vegetation in addition to rock or inorganic matter;



      5.   Encourage the use of low-impact development measures,
including drought-tolerant plant material, water-conserving automatic
irrigation systems, and pervious pavement materials.



   B.   Applicability.  The provisions of this section shall apply to
lots and parcels in any zone district that contain (i) more than 10,000
square feet of lot area, and (ii) a primary structure with a primary use
other than a single family detached, single-family attached, 2-family
residential, or live-work use, when the following conditions occur after the
effective date of this Code:



      1.   A new primary structure is constructed;



      2.   The floor area in an existing primary structure is
increased by more than 25%;



      3.   An existing primary structure is relocated on the lot or
parcel;



      4.   The primary structure is renovated or redeveloped
(including but not limited to reconstruction after fire, flood, or other
damage), and the value of that renovation or redevelopment, as indicated by
building permits, is more than 25% of the actual value of the property, as
indicated by tax assessor’s records;



      5.   A new primary use parking lot containing 25 or more
spaces is constructed; or



      6.   An existing primary use parking lot containing 25 or more
spaces is redesigned or reconstructed with significant changes to the layout
of parking spaces, driving aisles, and access drives.



   C.   General landscaping standards.



      1.   Landscape plan required.  A landscaping plan meeting
city requirements shall be submitted as part of all applications for
development or redevelopment requiring a site plan/design review process
under § 14.05.04H., unless the Zoning Administrator determines that
landscaping required under this section can be demonstrated without the use
of a landscaping plan. A landscaping plan may be combined with other required
application materials.



      2.   Minimum required landscaping.  Landscaping shall be
installed to comply with the specific requirements for street trees, property
edge buffering, and parking area landscaping standards in this section to
meet the following minimum landscape requirements:



         a.   R-3, R-M, R-CHD, R-SGD, and R-UMS Zoning
Districts.  In multi-family residential zoning districts, a minimum of 20%
of the total lot area shall be landscaped.



         b.   Mixed use zoning districts.  In all mixed-use
zoning districts, a minimum of 15% of the total land area shall be landscaped.



         c.   Special purpose zoning districts.  In all special
purpose zoning districts, a minimum of 10% of the total land area shall be
landscaped.



         d.   Parking in common. Minimum landscape area
requirements for properties within approved PIC plans shall be met by
complying with landscape element of PIC plan.



      3.   Plant materials.



         a.   Plant materials shall be from the city’s approved
water conserving plant list, or as otherwise approved through the site
plan/design review process.  All plant material shall be hardy to
northwestern Arizona (USDA hardiness Zone 10a), free of disease and insects,
and conform to the American Standard for Nursery Stock of the American
Association of Nurserymen.



         b.   Except for plantings used for screening, no 1
species of tree or shrub may make up more than 50% of the total amount of
landscape plantings.



         c.   Invasive species, as identified by the Arizona
Department of Agriculture Plant Services Division and the Arizona Invasive
Species Advisory Council, are prohibited.



         d.   At least 50% of all landscaped areas containing
trees and shrubs shall be planted with ground cover, and remaining areas
shall incorporate a minimum 2-inch layer of inert ground cover.



         e.   The use of artificial plant material is prohibited,
unless approved by the Director based on considerations of similarity of
appearance to live vegetation, durability appropriate for its anticipated
use, and public safety.



      4.   Minimum plant sizes.  When included as part of the
required landscaping, trees shall be a minimum 24-inch container size, and
shrubs shall be a minimum 5-gallon container size.  The above dimensions
apply to sizes at time of planting.



      5.   Plant material spacing.  Except for the provisions of
division F. below, plant materials shall not be placed closer than 4 feet
from any fence line or property line. Where tree planting requirements are
based on linear street frontage, areas occupied by driveways shall be
included when calculating the number of trees required to be planted, and any
trees that would otherwise be required in driveways shall be planted in other
landscaped front yard areas unless prohibited by minimum spacing requirements
for that species.



      6.   Landscape features.  Landscaped areas may include
architectural features that add visual interest and a public amenity to the
site including rock groupings, sculptures, public art, water features and
benches.



      7.   City right-of-way.  Property owners are encouraged to
install landscaping on portions of the public right-of-way located between
the front property line and the vehicle travel lanes not occupied by
sidewalks, above-ground utility structures, or curb and gutter structures. 
However, all planting or removal of trees or vegetation in city rights-of-way
is subject to approval by the city.



      8.   Flexibility for redevelopment.  Where the requirements
of this section are applied to a redevelopment or reconstruction project,
rather than a new development, the Zoning Administrator may authorize a
reduction of minimum off-street parking requirements established in §
14.04.02C. by up to 10%, if necessary, to accommodate street frontage
landscaping required by division D. below or parking area landscaping
required by division E. below.



      9.   Installation and performance bond.  Landscaping shall be
installed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, unless a
security equal to 100% of the anticipated cost of landscaping is filed with
the city, assuring installation within 6 months after occupancy. Security may
consist of a performance bond payable to the city, cash, certified check, or
other assurance of completion approved by the City Attorney.  If the
installation of the landscaping is not completed within the 6 month period,
the security may be used by the city to complete the landscape installation.



   D.   Street frontage landscaping.  The street frontage of a
property subject to this section shall meet the following landscaping
requirements:



      1.   Required depth.  Street yard landscaping strips within
private yards adjacent to city rights-of-way shall be at least 10 feet in
width.



      2.   Street trees and shrubs.  Street trees and shrubs shall
be planted along a property’s street frontage in accordance with the
following:



         a.   One tree per 40 feet of linear street frontage,
planted on center, and in alignment with any similar street frontage
landscaping on adjacent lots, or if that is not possible or adjacent lots do
not contain front yard landscaping, then within 10 feet of the front property
line.



         b.   One shrub per 25 feet of linear frontage.



         c.   No more than 50% of required trees shall be from 1
tree species.



         d.   Street trees may be clustered and placed at uneven
intervals, to increase visual appeal or to avoid utility or site
obstructions, with approval from the Zoning Administrator during the site
plan/design review process.



   E.   Parking area landscaping.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section to provide
landscaping areas internal to parking lots to break up large expanses of
pavement, provide shaded areas, delineate pedestrian walkways and vehicular
drive aisles to improve visitor safety, and improve the overall appearance of
the site.



      2.   Minimum required area.  Ten percent of the interior
parking area occupied by parking spaces and interior vehicle circulation
aisles (but not including access driveways between the public street and the
edge of the parking area) shall be landscaped.  Landscaping required to meet
the requirements of division D. above, or division F. below shall not be used
to satisfy this requirement.



      3.   Location and design.  Internal landscape areas shall be
designed in accordance with the following standards, as depicted in Figures
4.04-2 to 4.04-4.







 



   Figure 4.04-2:  Parking Lot Landscaping Locations

   Figure 4.04-4:  Parking Area Curb Breaks



         a.   A landscape area shall be located between every 15
parking spaces at a minimum.



         b.   A landscape area shall be a minimum of 8 feet in
width.



         c.   One tree is required for every 300 square feet of
internal landscape area.



         d.   A landscape area shall be designed lower than the
paved area so that stormwater from the paved parking areas can flow into the
landscape areas, unless a different result is required by the adopted city
Stormwater Management Plan.



         e.   A landscape area shall be curbed to protect the
landscape materials, and this curbing shall include breaks to permit
stormwater to enter the landscaped areas.



      4.   Pedestrian walkways.



         a.   Location.



            i.   Each surface parking area containing 100 or
more parking spaces, any of which are located more than 300 feet from the
front façade of the building shall contain at least 1 walkway that enables a
pedestrians to travel from the farthest row of parking to the primary
building entrance without crossing any parking spaces or drive aisles.



            ii.   Additional walkways shall be included and
spaced 200 feet apart to ensure that no parking space in the farthest row of
the parking lot is more than 200 feet from any walkway.



            iii.   If there is a public sidewalk along the
street frontage located within 50 feet of any required walkway, the walkway
shall connect to that sidewalk.



         b.   Design.  The required walkway shall be at least 5
feet wide; shall be located in a landscaped island and shall run
perpendicular to the primary building, to the greatest extent practicable. If
the walkway is located in a landscaped island, the width of the island shall
be increased by 5 feet to accommodate the walkway without reducing the amount
of landscaped area.



   F.   Property edge buffering.



      1.   Buffering required.  Where a property contains at least
10,000 square feet of area, more than 1,500 square feet of paved area, or any
vehicle loading/ unloading areas, buffering shall be installed as required by
Table 4.04-2.



         a.   To use this table, identify the applicant’s zone
district and proposed land use across the top of the table, and then read
down the appropriate column. Then identify the adjacent property zoning and
use along the horizontal lines. The box at the intersection of the column
representing the applicant’s proposal and the adjacent property zone and
use identifies the screening and buffering requirement for the applicant.



         b.   Transitional screening shall not be required for
community gardens.

the R-A, R-E, R-1, and R-2 Districts that share a side or rear lot line with
a lot in the R-A, R-E, R-1, and R-2 Districts containing a single- or
2-family dwelling.



      2.   If any of these standards conflict with the dimensional
standards in § 14.04.01, intended for neighborhood protection, the stricter
standard shall apply.



   C.   Building height.  Buildings constructed after the effective
date of this Code with a height greater than 30 feet shall reduce the
perceived height of the building when viewed from adjacent lots by using at
least 1 of the following techniques.



      1.   “Stepping down” building height of any portion of the
building within 100 feet of the side and rear lot lines to a maximum of 30
feet, unless the dimensional standards of § 14.04.01 require stepping down
to a lower height.



      2.   Increasing the side yard and rear yard setbacks a minimum
of 10 feet beyond that otherwise required in the zone district where the
property is located.



   D.   Screening and buffering.



      1.   The standards of § 14.04.04F. apply.

containing a use other than a single- or 2-family use and any side property
line abutting a lot containing a single- or 2-family dwelling.



      2.   If the context of a site makes division E.1. above
impractical, the Zoning Administrator may approve a parking lot design that
locates a parking area, drive-through lane, vehicle circulation driveway, or
a combination of these 3 site planning elements, in the area described in
division E.1. above, provided all of those 3 site planning elements are
located at least 6 feet from an adjacent lot containing a single- or 2-family
dwelling.

§ 14.04.07  SITE AND BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.



   A.   Intent.  The intent of this section is to:



      1.   Allow full development of properties consistent with the
dimensional and other district specific standards established in Article II
and § 14.04.01 while establishing basic requirements for building and site
features that will create stable residential neighborhoods, mixed use,
commercial, and industrial areas.



      2.   Enhance the public realm.



      3.   Reduce conflicts between existing and new structures.



      4.   Encourage effective development of street frontages and
other public elements that enable new projects to add value to existing
communities.



      5.   Encourage creative and sustainable design responses to
contemporary opportunities.



      6.   Improve the overall design quality of the city through
the use of objective standards that can be administered by the Department
without the need for individualized design review of projects.



   B.   Site design.



      1.   Applicability.  The standards of this division B. apply
to all development in the city.  The standards of divisions B.3. and B.4.
below apply to all new development, redevelopment, and remodels, in any
zoning district, except single-family detached, single-family attached,
2-family, co-housing, and live/work residential dwellings.



      2.   Grading and drainage.



         a.   Site grading and drainage system designs shall be
in compliance with the adopted city Stormwater Management Plan and approved
by the city.

source to flow from that lot to an adjoining lot other than as nature
intended unless it is directed to an existing drainage easement.



      3.   Site utilities.  On-site utilities that provide direct
service to a property shall be installed underground. The developer or owner
shall be responsible for complying with this requirement and making the
necessary arrangements with the utility companies for installation of
necessary facilities, unless the Commission or Council waives this
requirement when approving a development project. Appurtenances and
associated equipment (not including light or power poles) may be placed
aboveground, provided they are not be placed in required front or side yard
setbacks and are adequately screened to prevent visibility from the street.



      4.   Site layout.  The overall layout of a proposed project
site including but not limited to building placement, parking lot and loading
areas, driveway access, and circulation patterns shall be designed to not
adversely impact existing or future development of surrounding properties and
traffic patterns on adjacent streets.



   C.   Building design.



      1.   Applicability.

Districts.



         b.   A change in the principal use of an existing
structure that does not alter the exterior of the structure, or only affects
the signage on the exterior of the structure.



         c.   In the case of a conflict between the design
standards in this section and design standards applicable to a particular
project because of its location in a zoning district listed in §§ 14.02.03
through 14.02.05 with specific standards, an overlay district listed in §
14.02.06, or because of a use-specific standard in § 14.03.03, the
provisions of the base or overlay zoning district or use-specific standard
shall govern.



      2.   Materials.  Materials used in constructing and finishing
a structure shall be of high quality, adobe, brick, stone, or cementitious
materials, durable under desert climate conditions, that display a similar
level of quality and architectural interest as materials used in the design
of structures adjacent to the proposed structure.  Materials may not create
shine or create glare that the Director determines will create a risk to
traffic safety.



      3.   Colors.  The color of exterior building walls and roofs,
retaining walls, and accessory structures on a proposed site shall be similar
to and reflect (1) the predominant natural colors of the area or (2) the
colors used on the built environment adjacent to the proposed development.

shall have direct access to a sidewalk, walkway, or pathway that leads to a
public street.  Each of these pedestrian connections shall comply with §
14.04.03.  If a sidewalk does not currently exist, and there is a sidewalk
system in place on either adjacent property with frontage on the same street,
sidewalks shall be installed to connect to the existing sidewalk system.



      5.   Wall plane length and articulation.  When the primary
use of the building is not categorized as Industrial in Table 3-1, each
façade greater than 100 feet in length abutting a public street shall

property owners shall be responsible for each of the additional maintenance,
replacement, and operating standards set forth in this section.



      2.   Landscape maintenance.  Landscaping shall be maintained
in an orderly and healthy condition. This shall include regular pruning,
mowing of turf, weeding, removal of litter, fertilizing, replacement of
plants when necessary, and application of appropriate quantities of water to

surroundings and the floor of trash/recyclable material enclosures are kept
clean and free of debris, that the enclosure gates have operable latches,
that the enclosure gates remain closed, and that the container lids remain
closed at all times except during periods of actual use. Trash to be

   B.   Operating standards.  All structures, uses, and activities in
all zone districts shall be used or occupied so as to avoid creating any
dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable condition that would
create



adverse impacts on the residents, employees, or visitors on the property
itself or on neighboring properties. Uses and activities that operate in
violation of applicable state or federal statutes or this Code are presumed
to be a violation of this division B. Property owner responsibilities under
this section shall include but shall not be limited to the following:



      1.   Glare.  Direct or reflected glare, including glare from
exterior lighting, shall not be visible at the property line.



      2.   Noise.  All activities shall comply with Chapter 9.30 of
the City Code and shall be conducted so as to avoid the creation of any noise
that would create a public nuisance or a nuisance interfering with the use
and enjoyment of adjacent properties. Any amplified sound equipment shall be
mounted so as to direct sounds inward from properties, rather than outward
towards property boundaries. Amplified sounds shall not be allowed to cross
property lines unless a temporary use permit has been issued for that purpose
in connection with a special event.



      3.   Odors.  All activities shall comply with state statutes
and regulations. No operation shall cause or allow the emission of any
odorous air contaminant that is a nuisance, hazard or exceeds applicable

      4.   Smoke.  All activities shall comply with state statutes
and regulations. No operation shall discharged into the atmosphere any
contaminant for which threshold limit values are listed for working
atmosphere by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
in such quantity that the concentration of the contaminant at ground level at
any point beyond the boundary of the property shall at any time exceed the
threshold limit established by such conference or by any state or federal law
or regulation. Visible emissions of any kind at ground level past the lot
line of the property on which the source of the emissions is located are
prohibited.



      5.   Vibration.  No use or activity shall cause inherent and
recurring generated vibration perceptible without instruments at any point
along the property line. Temporary construction is excluded from this
restriction.



      6.   Hazardous materials.  All uses and activities shall
comply with state statutes and regulations regarding the use, storage,
handling, and transportation of flammable liquids, liquefied petroleum,
gases, explosives, hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, toxic materials and
solid wastes, as those terms are defined by applicable statutes, rules,
regulations, or ordinances.

that might cause fumes or dust or that constitute a fire hazard or that may
be edible by or otherwise be attractive to rodents or insects shall be stored

accordance with the requirements of this Development Code. Lubrication and
fuel substances shall be prevented from leaking and/or draining onto the
ground. All sewage and industrial wastes shall be treated and disposed of in
compliance with the water quality standards applicable of the state and
federal government.

does not comply with the then current regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission regarding that type of electromagnetic radiation
source. In case of governmental communications facilities, governmental
agencies, and government owned plants, the regulations of the
interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee shall take precedence over the
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, regarding such sources
of electromagnetic radiation.

within the city shall be constructed, used, operated, and maintained in such

to a higher decision-making body, “decision” means that the review
authority makes the final decision on the matter, “appeal” means that the
review authority may consider and decide upon appeals to the decisions of an
earlier decision-making body, in compliance with § 14.05.03O.

   (1)   The Zoning Administrator may defer action on applications and
refer the items to the BOA for the final decision.

   (2)   The Director may defer action on applications and refer the
items to the BOA for the final decision.

   (3)   Sitting as the Administrative Hearings Officer.

   (4)   Any person(s) aggrieved by a decision of the BOA may, at any
time within 30 days after the BOA has rendered its decision, file a complaint
for special action in the Superior Court to review the BOA’s decision, in
compliance with state law (A.R.S. § 9-362.06K.).




 



(Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.05.03  STANDARD REGULATORY PROCEDURES.



   A.   General review criteria.  When this Development Code does not
state additional criteria for a decision, the decision shall be based on
whether the application is consistent with the requirements of this
Development Code.



   B.   Preapplication review.



      1.   A prospective applicant or agent may request a
preapplication review with the Department before completion of project design
and the formal submittal of a permit application.



      2.   A request by an applicant for preapplication review,
accompanied by preliminary project plans and designs and the required filing
fee, shall be reviewed by all affected city departments and other selected
agencies.



      3.   The reviewing city staff members may inform the applicant
of requirements as they apply to the proposed development project, provide a
preliminary list of issues that will likely be of concern during formal
application review, suggest possible alternatives or modifications to the
project, and identify any technical studies that may be necessary for the
review process when a formal application is filed.



      4.   Neither the preapplication review nor information or
pertinent policies provided by the Department shall be construed as a
Department recommendation for approval or disapproval of the
application/project.



   C.   Application preparation and filing.  The preparation and
filing of applications for permits, approvals, and other matters pertaining
to this Development Code shall comply with the following requirements.



      1.   Application contents.  Applications shall include the
forms provided by the Department, and all information and materials required
by the application content requirements handout provided by the Department
for the specific type of application. Unless an exception is stated in this
Development Code, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide
evidence in support of any findings required by this Development Code.



      2.   Eligibility.  Applications may be made by the owner of
the subject property, or by any agent or representative with the written
consent of the property owner.



      3.   Filing.  All land use permits and other applications
required by this Development Code shall be filed with the Department.



      4.   Filing date.  The filing date of an application shall be
the date on which the Department receives the last submission, map, plan, or
other material required by the Department as a part of that application, in
compliance with division F. below and the application is deemed complete by
the Zoning Administrator.



   D.   Application fees.



      1.   Filing fees required.



         a.   Each application for a permit, approval,
entitlement, or other matter related to this Development Code shall be
accompanied by the applicable fee.



         b.   The city’s processing fees are cumulative.  For
example, if an application for a lot split also requires a variance, both
fees shall be charged.



         c.   Processing shall not commence on an application
until all required fees/deposits have been paid.



         d.   Without the application fee, or a deposit if
appropriate, the application shall not be deemed complete.



         e.   The city is not required to continue processing any
application unless additionally required fees/deposits (e.g., additionally
required “real cost” deposits) are paid in full.



         f.   Failure to pay the applicable fees/deposits is
grounds for rejection of the application.  No permit application shall be
processed without first being accompanied by the required fee, unless the fee
is reduced or waived in compliance with division D.2. below.



      2.   Fee reductions or waivers.  The City Manager may reduce
or waive certain fees required by the Council’s fee resolution for
sufficient cause being demonstrated by the applicant in compliance with §
2.20.070 of the City Code.



      3.   Refunds and withdrawals.



         a.   Recognizing that filing fees are utilized to cover
city costs of public hearings, mailing, posting, transcripts, and staff time
involved in processing applications, no refunds due to a disapproval are
allowed.



         b.   In the case of a withdrawal, the Director may
authorize a partial refund based upon the pro-rated costs to-date and
determination of the status of the application at the time of withdrawal.



   E.   Concurrent permit processing.  When a single application
requires more than 1 permit or approval under this Development Code, the
Director may determine that all of the applications shall be reviewed, and
approved or disapproved, by the highest level review authority assigned by §
14.05.02 to any of the required applications.  For example, a project that
requires a Zoning Map amendment and a conditional use permit may be reviewed,
and approved or disapproved by the Council (after a recommendation from the
Commission), whereas a conditional use permit application by itself may be
reviewed and acted upon by the Commission.



   F.   Initial application review.  All applications filed with the
Department in compliance with this Development Code shall be initially
processed as follows.



      1.   Completeness review.  The Zoning Administrator shall
review all applications for completeness and accuracy before they are
accepted as being complete in compliance with divisions C. and D. above.



         a.   Notification of applicant.  The applicant shall be
informed, either that the application is complete and has been accepted for
processing, or that the application is incomplete and that additional
information, specified in a letter, must be provided.



         b.   Appeal of determination.  Where the Zoning
Administrator has determined that an application is incomplete, and the
applicant believes that the application is complete and/or that the
information requested by the Zoning Administrator is not required, the
applicant may appeal the determination in compliance with § 14.05.03O.



         c.   Expiration of application.  If the applicant does
not provide the additional information required in compliance with division
F.1.a., above, within 120 days after the date of the letter requesting the
additional information, the Zoning Administrator may consider the application
withdrawn if the Zoning Administrator determines that reasonable progress
toward completion of the application has not occurred.  Application
processing shall not resume thereafter until a new application is filed,
including fees, plans, exhibits, and other materials that are required for
any project on the same site.



         d.   Criteria for acceptance.  An application shall not
be accepted as complete unless or until the Zoning Administrator determines
that it includes all information and materials required by divisions C. and
D. above.



         e.   Violations on the site.



            i.   The Zoning Administrator shall not find the
application complete, and/or shall not process or approve the application, if
conditions exist on the site in violation of this Development Code or any
permit or other approval granted in compliance with this Development Code. 
The only exception shall be an application for an entitlement or permit
needed to correct the on-site violation(s).



            ii.   The Zoning Administrator’s authority under
this division F. shall apply whether:



               (A)   The current applicant was the owner of
the subject property at the time the violation occurred; or



               (B)   The applicant is the current owner of
the subject property with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation at the time of acquisition of the subject property.



            iii.   The Zoning Administrator’s decision may
be appealed in compliance with § 14.05.03O.



      2.   Referral of application.  At the discretion of the
Director, or where otherwise required by this Development Code, state, or
federal law, any application filed in compliance with this Development Code
may be referred to any public agency that may be affected by or have an
interest in the proposed land use activity.



   G.   Public hearings.  This article establishes procedures for
public hearings before the BOA, Commission, and Council.  When a public
hearing is required by this Development Code, public notice shall be given
and the hearing shall be conducted as provided by this article.



      1.   Conduct of hearings.  Hearings shall be held at the
date, time, and place described in the public notice required by division H.
below.



      2.   Continuances.  If a hearing cannot be completed on the
scheduled date, the presiding BOA member, Commissioner, or Councilperson
before the adjournment or recess of the hearing, may continue the hearing by
publicly announcing the date, time, and place to which the hearing will be
continued.



      3.   Additional notice not required.  Additional notice for
the continued hearing is not required if notice of the original hearing has
begun pursuant to division H. below and a publicly announced date of a
continued hearing is made pursuant to division G.2 above.



   H.   Notice of hearing.  When a land use permit or other matter
requires a public hearing, the public shall be provided notice of the hearing
in compliance with state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.04) and as required by this
article.

               (B)   In proceedings involving rezoning of

send copies of the notice of public hearing by first class mail to the
military airport or facility.



            iv.   Notice for rezoning not initiated by
property owner.  In proceedings that are not initiated by the property owner
involving rezoning of land that may change the zoning classification, notice
by first class mail shall be sent to each real property owner, as shown on

                  (2)   If the city issues utility bills

fee not to exceed $5 per year for providing this service.



      3.   Additional notices.  Although not required by state law,

         b.   Mailed notice.



            i.   Notice shall be sent by first class mail, at

               (D)   Any person who has filed a written
request for notice with the Director and has paid the fee established by the
Council’s fee resolution for the notice.



            ii.   The 300-foot radius shall be measured from
the exterior boundaries of the subject lot to the exterior boundaries of the
neighboring lots, without reference to structures existing on either lot(s)
in the following manner:



               (A)   Notification boundaries shall always
include all lots on both sides of interior residential streets; and



               (B)   For proposed projects fronting on
major arterial streets or highways the 300-foot radius shall not include the
width of the adjoining right-of-way but shall be measured entirely from the
opposite side of the arterial street or highway.



      4.   Optional notice.  In addition to the methods of notice
required by divisions H.2. and H.3., above, the Director may provide
additional notice with content or using a distribution method as the Director
determines is necessary or desirable.



      5.   Failure to receive notice.  The failure of any person or
entity to receive notice shall not constitute grounds for any court to
invalidate the actions of the city, in compliance with state law (A.R.S. §
9-462.04A.7.).



   I.   Recommendation by Commission.



      1.   Commission’s action.  At the conclusion of any public
hearing on an amendment the Commission shall forward a recommendation,
including all required findings, to the Council for final action.



      2.   Mailing of recommendation.  Following the hearing, a
copy of the Commission’s recommendation shall be mailed to the applicant at
the address shown on the application.



   J.   Review authority decision and notice.



      1.   Decision.



         a.   The review authority (BOA, Commission, or Council,
as applicable) may announce and record its decision on the matter being
considered at the conclusion of a scheduled hearing or defer action and
continue the matter to a later meeting agenda in compliance with division G.
above.



         b.   Where the Director has authority to issue a permit
or approval under this Development Code, the Director may instead refer a
matter to the Commission for determination.  A referral shall require a
noticed hearing before the Commission.



         c.   The action of the BOA or Commission shall be by
affirmative vote of a simple majority of a quorum, except where state law
requires a different percentage.



         d.   The decision of the Council on any matter shall be
final.



      2.   Notice of decision.  The notice of decision shall
contain any conditions of approval determined to be reasonable and necessary
to protect the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or general
welfare of the city.



      3.   Mailing of notice of decision.  Following the date that
the final decision or recommendation is rendered by the applicable review
authority, notice of the decision shall be mailed to the applicant at the
address shown on the application.  A copy of the notice of decision shall
also be sent to the property owner, if different from the applicant, to all
other persons who have filed a written request for notice, and to each member
of the BOA, Commission, and Council.



   K.   Effective dates.  A decision of the Zoning Administrator,
Director, BOA, Commission, or Council shall become effective following the
final decision on the application by the applicable review authority, unless
an appeal of the review authority’s action has been filed in compliance
with § 14.05.03O., as follows:



      1.   Decisions by the Zoning Administrator, Director, or
Commission shall be effective 15 days after the decision;



      2.   Decisions by the BOA shall be effective 30 days after the
decision; and



      3.   Decisions by the Council shall be effective 30 days after
the decision, unless enacted as an emergency ordinance.



   L.   Time limits and extensions.



      1.   Time limits.



         a.   Unless conditions of approval or other provisions
of this Development Code establish a different time limit, any permit or
approval (except for Planned Development permits, which are subject to
division L.1.b. below, and Zoning Map Amendments) granted in compliance with
this Development Code that is not exercised within 12 months of its approval
shall expire and become void after action by the Council in compliance with
state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.01), unless an extension of time is approved in
compliance with division L.2. below.



         b.   The permit or approval shall not be deemed
“exercised” until the permittee has at least obtained a building permit
and substantial construction in compliance with a building permit has taken
place, or has actually commenced the allowed use on the subject site in
compliance with the conditions of approval, as determined by the Director.



         c.   The permit or approval under this Development Code
shall remain valid after it has been exercised as long as a building permit
is active for the project, or a final building inspection or certificate of
occupancy has been granted. If the approval also involves a zoning map
amendment, that portion of the approval shall be returned to the Council with
notice, in compliance with state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.01E.).



      2.   Extensions of time.  Upon request by the applicant, the
review authority may extend the time for an approved permit to be exercised
in the following manner.



         a.   The applicant shall file a written request for an
extension of time with the Department at least 30 days before the expiration
of the permit, together with the filing fee required by the Council’s fee
resolution.



         b.   The burden of proof is on the permittee to
establish with substantial evidence that the permit should not expire. If the
review authority determines that the permittee has proceeded in good faith
and has exercised due diligence in complying with the conditions in a timely
manner, the review authority may grant a time extension for up to an
additional 12 months from the date of the decision to extend the permit or
approval; provided, the review authority first finds that there are adequate
provisions for public services and utilities (e.g., access, drainage, fire
protection, sewers, water, and the like), to ensure that the proposed
extension would not endanger, jeopardize, or otherwise constitute a hazard to
the public health, safety, or general welfare, or be injurious to the
property or improvements in the vicinity and applicable zoning district.



         c.   No more than 2 12-month time extensions shall be
granted.



      3.   Hearing on expiration.  At the request of the applicant,
the review authority may hold a hearing on any proposed expiration of a
permit, in compliance with divisions G. and H. above.



      4.   Terminated by discontinuance.



         a.   Permit shall lapse.  A permit, approval, or
entitlement under this Development Code shall lapse (e.g., shall have the
effect of terminating the permit, approval, or entitlement and denying the
privileges granted by the original approval) if the use associated with the
permit or entitlement is terminated for a period of at least 180 days.



         b.   Recommencement.  Recommencement of a use
authorized by a permit, approval, or entitlement after the 180-day period has
expired shall require the filing of a new application, together with the
filing fee required by the Council’s fee resolution.



   M.   Resubmittals.



      1.   Resubmittals prohibited within 180 days.  For a period
of 180 days following the disapproval of a discretionary land use permit,
approval, entitlement, or amendment by the Director, BOA, Commission, or
Council, no application for the same or substantially similar discretionary
permit, approval, entitlement, or amendment for the same site shall be
accepted for filing.



      2.   Director’s determination.  The Director shall
determine whether the new application is for a discretionary land use permit,
approval, entitlement, amendment, or other approval that is the same or
substantially similar to the previously disapproved permit, approval,
entitlement, or amendment.



      3.   Appeal.  The determination of the Director may be
appealed to the Commission, in compliance with § 14.05.03O.



   N.   Changes to an approved project.  Development or a new land use
authorized through a permit, approval, or entitlement granted pursuant to
this Development Code shall be established only as approved by the review
authority and subject to any conditions of approval, except where changes to
the project are approved in compliance with this section.



      1.   Request for change.  An applicant shall request desired
changes in writing, and shall also furnish supporting materials and an
explanation of the reasons for the request. Changes may be requested either
before or after construction or establishment and operation of the approved
use; however, a change in use shall be requested and approved before
initiating the new use.



      2.   Minor changes.  The Director may approve changes to an
approved site plan, architecture, or the nature of the approved use if the
changes:



         a.   Are consistent with all applicable provisions of
this Development Code;



         b.   Do not involve a feature of the project that was
specifically addressed in the project approval; 



         c.   Do not involve a feature of the project that led to
conditions of project approval;



         d.   Do not involve specific considerations by the
applicable review authority in the approval of the permit; and



         e.   Do not expand the approved floor area or any
outdoor activity area by 10% or more over the life of the project.



      3.   Major changes.  Changes to the project that do not
comply with division N.2. above, shall only be approved by the applicable
review authority through a new permit application.



   O.   Appeals.



      1.   Applicability.  This section establishes procedures for
the following:



         a.   The BOA’s review of a decision rendered by the
Zoning Administrator in compliance with state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.06).



         b.   The Commission’s review of a decision rendered by
the Director, including but not limited to any appeal in which it is sitting
as the Administrative Hearing Officer pursuant to § 14.05.01B.5.f.;



         c.   The Council’s review of a decision rendered by
the Director or Commission;



         d.   Appeals by other eligible appellants, in compliance
with division O.2. below.



      2.   Eligibility.  An appeal may be filed by:



         a.   Administrative determination.  Any eligible person
affected by an administrative determination or decision by the Zoning
Administrator or Director.



         b.   Land use permit or hearing decision.  In the case
of a land use permit or hearing decision by the Commission, by any eligible
person affected by the decision and who, in person or through a
representative, presented testimony at a public hearing in connection with
the decision being appealed, or who otherwise informed the city in writing of
the nature of their concerns before the hearing.



         c.   Definition of eligible person.  An ELIGIBLE PERSON
is anyone who lives, or conducts business, within 300 feet of the subject
property, or a member of the approving body.



      3.   Appeal subjects and jurisdiction.  Determinations and
decisions that may be appealed, and the authority to act upon an appeal shall
be as follows.



         a.   Appeals to BOA.  Decisions by the Zoning
Administrator on specified permits, approvals, or entitlements may be
appealed to the BOA.



         b.   Appeals to Commission.  Decisions by the Director
may be appealed to the Commission.



         c.   Appeals to Council.  Decisions by the Commission
may be appealed to the Council.



      4.   Appeals to BOA by eligible person.  In the case of an
appeal to the BOA by an eligible person, the Zoning Administrator shall
schedule a hearing on the matter.



      5.   Appeals to Commission by eligible person.  In the case
of an appeal to the Commission by an eligible person, the Director shall
schedule a hearing on the matter.



      6.   Council’s review.



         a.   Appeals by eligible person.  In the case of an
appeal of a Commission decision to Council by an eligible person, the
Director shall schedule a hearing on the matter.



         b.   Appeal by Council.  The Council may choose to
review a decision rendered by the Commission or Director, but only when the
Director is acting as the Director.  A member of the Council may request the
opportunity to discuss any decision previously rendered.  A majority vote of
the Council, taken before the effective date of the review authority’s
decision, is required to initiate an appeal of the decision.  Once the vote
to initiate an appeal is passed by a majority, the matter shall be scheduled
for hearing by the City Clerk.



         c.   Referral to applicable review authority.  The
Council shall have the authority, at any time before its final determination
on the appeal, to refer the matter back to the applicable review authority
for additional consideration. The Council may instruct the review authority
to conduct an additional public hearing in order to accept new evidence
relating to the matter subject to appeal.



         d.   Decision final.  The decision of the Council on
the appeal shall be final and shall become effective upon adoption of the
resolution by the Council.



      7.   Administrative Hearing Officer review.



         a.   Review.  The Commission, sitting as the
Administrative Hearing Officer, shall decide appeals commenced by property
owners from any final determination made by an administrative agency or
official of the city that conditions an approval for the use, improvement, or
development of real property on the requirement of an exaction or dedication.
This section does not apply to a dedication or exaction required in a
legislative act of the Council that does not give discretion to a city
administrative agency or city official to determine the nature or extent of
the dedication or exaction.



         b.   Notice to property owners of rights to appeal.  In
each case in which a city administrative agency or city official grants an
approval for the use, improvement, or development of real property subject to
the requirement of a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting the
approval, the city shall notify the property owner in writing that the
property owner has the right to appeal the dedication or exaction and shall
additionally provide the property owner with a written description of the
appeal process.



         c.   Waiver of right to appeal prohibited.  No
official, agency, or employee of the city shall request any property owner to
waive their right of appeal at any time.



         d.     Appeal application and procedure.  The appeal
of a property owner shall be in writing and received by the Administrative
Hearing Officer within 30 days after the final determination is made.  No
fee shall be charged to a property owner for filing the appeal.  After
receipt of a written request for an appeal, the Commission shall schedule a
time and date for the hearing no later than 30 days following the receipt of
the appeal.



         e.   Hearing an appeal.  At the time of the hearing on
the appeal, the city shall have the burden to establish that there is an
essential nexus between the dedication or exaction and a legitimate
governmental interest and that the proposed dedication or exaction is roughly
proportional to the impact of the proposed use, improvement, or development.



         f.   Decision.  The Administrative Hearing Officer
shall decide the appeal within 5 working days after the hearing. If the city
does not meet its burden under division O.7.e., above, the Commission,
sitting as the Administrative Hearing Officer, shall modify or delete the
requirement of the dedication or exaction. If the Commission, sitting as the
Administrative Hearing Officer, modifies or affirms the requirement of the
dedication or exaction, a property owner aggrieved by that decision may, at
any time within 30 days after that decision, file a complaint for a trial de
novo in the Superior Court.



      8.   Filing, processing, review, and action on appeals.



         a.   Form of appeal.



            i.   Appeal applications addressed to the BOA,
Commission, or City Council shall be filed with the City Clerk.



            ii.   The appeal application shall:



               (A)   Specifically state the pertinent facts
of the case and the basis for the appeal; and



               (B)   Be accompanied by the information
identified in the Department handout for appeal applications.



         b.   Delay of proceedings.  Filing of an appeal, other
than a special action appeal, in compliance with state law (A.R.S. §
9-462.06K.), shall delay all proceedings associated with the matter subject
to the appeal, pending the city’s final action on the appeal.



         c.   Withdrawal.  An appeal may not be withdrawn nor
dismissed before the scheduled public hearing.



         d.   Joining an appeal.  Only those persons who file an
appeal within the specified appeal period shall be considered appellants of
the matter under appeal.  Any person who wishes to join an appeal shall
follow the same procedures for an appellant.  No person shall be allowed to
join an appeal after the end of the specified appeal period.



         e.   Action on appeals.  The appeal body shall conduct
a public hearing in compliance with divisions G. and H. above.



         f.   Scope of review and decision.  When reviewing an
appeal, the appeal body may:



            i.   Consider any issues associated with the
decision being appealed, in addition to the specific grounds for the appeal;



            ii.   Uphold, uphold in part, or reverse the
action, the determination, or decision that is the subject of the appeal; and



            iii.   Adopt additional conditions of approval
deemed reasonable and necessary.



         g.   New evidence.  If new or different evidence is
presented during the appeal hearing, the BOA, Commission, or Council, may
refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator, Director or Commission, as
applicable, for a report on the new or different evidence before a final
decision on the appeal.



         h.   Findings.  When reviewing an appeal, the appeal
body shall adopt findings in support of the intended action on the appeal.
The nature of the findings shall be in compliance with the findings adopted
by the original review authority.



         i.   Mailing of resolution.  The Director or City
Clerk, as applicable to the level of appeal body, shall mail a copy of the
decision to the appellant and the applicant (if not the appellant) following
the date the decision on the appeal is rendered.



   P.   Performance guarantees.  A permit applicant may be required by
conditions of approval or by action of the Director to provide adequate
security to guarantee the faithful performance and proper completion of any
approved work, and/or compliance with conditions of approval imposed by the
review authority. The provisions of this section apply to performance
guarantees for projects authorized by any of the land use permits, approvals,
or entitlements under by this Development Code.



      1.   Form and amount of security.  The required security
shall be in a form approved by the Director.  The amount of security shall
be as determined by the Director to be necessary to ensure proper completion
of the work and/or compliance with conditions of approval.



      2.   Security for maintenance.  In addition to any
improvement security required to guarantee proper completion of work, the
Director may require security for maintenance of the work, in an amount
determined by the Director to be sufficient to ensure the proper maintenance
and functioning of the improvements.



      3.   Duration of security.  Required improvement security
shall remain in effect until final inspections have been made and all work
has been approved by the Director, or until any warranty period required by
the Director has elapsed.



      4.   Release or forfeit of security.



         a.   Upon satisfactory completion of work and the
approval of a final inspection (or after the end of the required time for
maintenance security), the improvement and/or maintenance deposits or bonds
shall be released.



         b.   Upon failure to complete the work, failure to
comply with all of the terms of any applicable permit, or failure of the
completed improvements to function properly, the city may do the required
work or cause it to be done, and collect from the permittee or surety all the
costs incurred by the city, including the costs of the work, and all
administrative and inspection costs.



         c.   Any unused portion of the security shall be
refunded to the funding source after deduction of the cost of the work by the
city.



   Q.   Permits run with the land.  A land use permit, approval, or
entitlement granted in compliance with this Development Code shall continue
to be valid upon a change of ownership (e.g., of the site, structure, or use
that was the subject of the permit application), provided that the use and
development remains in compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Development Code and any conditions of approval.



(Ord. 18-1203, passed 8-14-2018; Ord. 16-1141, passed 2-23-2016)



§ 14.05.04  SPECIFIC REGULATORY PROCEDURES.



   A.   Zoning clearance.



      1.   Requirement.



         a.   A zoning clearance for a structure that is to be
erected or remodeled shall be filed in conjunction with the companion
building permit application;



         b.   A zoning clearance for the use of vacant
nonresidential land or structure(s) shall be filed at least 14 days before
the intended use inauguration;



         c.   In order to provide for an expeditious permit
review/reconstruction process, which may only be available following the
occurrence of a bona fide emergency (e.g., natural disaster, and the like),
as determined by the Council, an emergency building permit and temporary
zoning clearance may be issued by the appropriate city department; and



         d.   No person shall occupy, use, or alter any
structure, or change any use, or type or class of use, without first applying
for and obtaining the required zoning clearance.



      2.   Zoning Administrator’s action.  The Zoning
Administrator shall issue the zoning clearance after determining that the
proposed development/improvement complies with all of the applicable
standards and provisions for the category of use or the zoning district of
the subject lot, in full compliance with the City Code and this Development
Code.



      3.   Conflicting permits prohibited.  All departments,
officials, or public employees vested with the authority or duty to issue
permits where required by law shall conform to the provisions of this
Development Code. A permit for uses, structures, or purposes in conflict with
the provisions of this Development Code shall not be issued.  Any permit,
issued in conflict with the provisions of this Development Code, shall be
deemed void.



   B.   Sign permits.  A sign permit shall be required to erect,
construct, enlarge, move, alter, or reconstruct a sign except for signs that
are exempt from permits in compliance with § 14.04.08D.



   C.   Airport Overlay District permit.



      1.   Future uses.  Except as specifically provided in
divisions C.1.a., C.1.b., and C.1.c. below, no material change shall be made
in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established,
and no tree shall be planted in any portion of the Airport Overlay District
unless an Airport Overlay District permit has been applied for and granted.
Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit
is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations
in this division C.  If the Zoning Administrator determines that the
application complies with the regulations in this division C., the permit
shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of
this section shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in
compliance with division D. below.



         a.   In the area lying within the limits of the
horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 50 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features (e.g., structure or
tree) would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zones.



         b.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach
zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 5,000 feet from each end
of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 30 feet of vertical height above the ground except when the tree or
structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for the approach
zones.



         c.   In the area lying within the limits of the
transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 50 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for the transition zones. Nothing in any of the foregoing
exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess
of any of the height limits established by this section, except as set forth
in division D.4. below.



         d.   Existing uses.  No permit shall be granted that
would allow the establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit a
nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air
navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this section or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application
for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for these permits
shall be granted.



         e.   Obstruction marking and lighting.  Upon a
recommendation by the Federal Aviation Administration or the airport operator
stating that lighting is necessary to achieve the goals of the Airport
Overlay District and is reasonable under the circumstances, any permit or
variance granted may be conditioned to require the owner of the structure or
tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owners expense,
markings and lights as may be necessary.  Such a condition may be appealed
to the BOA pursuant to § 14.05.03O. and may be modified by the BOA to
require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate
and maintain the necessary markings and lights.



   D.   Variances, minor and major.



      1.   Applicability.  The provisions of this section allow for
variances from the development standards of this Development Code.



         a.   Eligibility.  A variance may only be granted when,
because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including
location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions, the
strict application of this Development Code denies the property privileges
enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning
district.  These same special circumstances must create an unnecessary
hardship, which is not the result of the actions of the applicant (or
self-imposed by the property owner), or must represent an unreasonable
regulation that makes it obviously impractical to require compliance with the
development standards.



         b.   Special privileges prohibited.  A variance shall
not be granted that would have the effect of granting a special privilege not
shared by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning
districts, or that is contrary to the public convenience, health, interest,
safety, or welfare.



         c.   Use variances prohibited.  The power to grant
variances does not permit changes in allowable land uses, in compliance with
state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.06H.1.). Flexibility in allowable land uses is
provided in division G. below.



      2.   Review authority.



         a.   The Zoning Administrator may grant a minor variance
in compliance with division D.3.  below, or may defer action and refer the
application to the BOA for formal action.



         b.   The BOA may grant a major variance in compliance
with division D.4. below, or may serve as the review authority on a minor
variance when requested by the Zoning Administrator.



      3.   Allowable minor variances.  An application for a minor
variance shall be considered by the Zoning Administrator only if it is of a
type, and for an adjustment within the maximum limits, shown in Table 5-2
below. A request that exceeds the limitations identified in Table 5-2 shall
require the filing of a major variance application in compliance with
division D.4. below.

10%



11.   Projections. An increase in the allowable projection of canopies,
cornices, eaves, fireplaces, landings, masonry chimneys, overhangs, raised

minor variances;



         b.   Dimensional standards including distance-separation

         f.   A variance to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property in a manner not
permitted by the Airport Overlay District, provided the application complies
with the following provisions.



            i.   The application for variance shall be
accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to
the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.



            ii.   These variances shall be allowed where the
review authority finds that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and the relief granted will
not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justices, and will be in compliance with the
spirit of this section.



            iii.   No application for a variance to the
requirements of the Airport Overlay Zone may be considered unless a copy of
the application has been furnished to the Public Works Director for advice as
to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Public Works Director
does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the BOA may
act on its own to grant or deny the application.



            iv.   The applicant shall notify the FAA prior to
the construction of a structure requiring a variance under this division D.4.



            Other standards including operational/performance
standards relating to dust, glare, hours of operation, landscaping, light,
noise, number of employees, and the like.



      5.   Notice and hearings.



         a.   Minor variances.  Notwithstanding the provisions
of § 14.05.03H., an application for a Zoning Administrator’s decision on a
minor variance shall be noticed by posting the subject site and notifying
immediately adjoining neighbors.



         b.   Major variances.  A public hearing by the BOA,
pursuant to §§ 14.05.03G. and 14.05.03H. is required for all major
variances.



      6.   Findings and decision. 



         a.   Following a public hearing, if required, the review
authority may approve a variance application, with or without conditions.



         b.   The applicable review authority shall record the
decision in writing with the findings on which the decision is based.



         c.   A variance application may be approved if it
complies with the following criteria:



            i.   Because of  special circumstances applicable
to the subject property including, location, shape, size, surroundings,
topography, or other conditions  the strict application of this Development
Code deprives the property of privileges enjoyed by other property of  the
same classification in the same or an identical zoning district; or



            ii.   The special circumstances create an
unnecessary hardship, which is not the result of the actions of the applicant
or self-imposed by the property owner; and



            iii.   Granting the variance would not constitute
a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other
properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property
is located; and



            iv.   Granting the variance would not  be
materially detrimental to the public convenience, health, interest, safety,
or welfare of the city, or injurious to the property or improvements in the
vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located.



      7.   Compliance with findings.  In approving a major or minor
variance, the review authority may impose conditions (e.g., buffers,
landscaping and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking,
performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, traffic
circulation, and the like) deemed reasonable and necessary to:



         a.   Ensure compliance with the general purpose of this
section, and the goals and policies of the General Plan and any applicable
specific plan;



         b.   Ensure that the variance does not grant special
privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the
vicinity and under the identical zoning district in which the property is
located;



         c.   Ensure that the approval would be in compliance
with the findings required by division G.  above; and



         d.   Protect the best interests of the surrounding
property or neighborhood, and to preserve the public health, safety, and
general welfare.



      8.   Post approval procedures.  The procedures relating to
appeals, changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this
Development Code shall apply following the approval of a variance.



   E.   Grading permit for 1- and 2-family dwellings.



      1.   Permit and fees required.  Grading or the placement of
fill shall not occur on any lot until a grading permit has been obtained from
the Director and the permit has been posted on the subject lot.  This
requirement is supplemental to and in addition to any requirements of the
adopted Building Code. Building permits shall not be issued prior to the
issuance of a grading permit.



      2.   Height of building site on upward sloping lots.



         a.   On upward sloping lots the building site may not be
higher than the average height of the lot excluding setbacks and easements.
The average lot grade shall be calculated by adding the grade elevations at
the intersection of the setback corners and dividing by the number of
corners. The Director may establish higher elevations of up to 2 feet above
the average lot grade. No import of fill material shall be allowed to achieve
the desired grade height and the exception shall not be for the purpose of
building a structure in excess of the maximum building height as allowed by
the zoning district standards. Approval of the 2-foot exception shall be
requested prior to the final grading inspection on the appropriate form
available in the Community Investment Department. A pad certification by a
registered Arizona land surveyor shall be submitted to the Building
Department to verify the pad height.



         b.   If a building pad elevation higher than that
provided for above is requested, the following criteria shall be used to
determine the maximum allowable grade. Additionally, a topographic plan,
containing the following information, prepared by an appropriately licensed
Arizona registrant, shall be submitted to the Director:



            i.   Topography;



            ii.   Proposed and existing grades at the lot
corners, setback corners, and proposed building pad corners;



            iii.   Proposed average lot floor elevations,
building pad dimensions, and pad square footage;



            iv.   Cut and fill quantities;



            v.   Driveway location and dimensions;



            vi.   Reference points of adjoining lots, and/or
structures;



            vii.   Method of slope retention.



         c.   The following criteria shall be met or the increase
in the grade height shall not be approved:



            i.   The adjusted lot grade shall be determined by
balancing the on-site cut and fill so as to create a minimum allowable
building pad of 7,000 square feet, or 5,000 square feet for lots of 12,000
square feet or less.



            ii.   No import of fill material shall be allowed
or be necessary for the creation of the minimum pad.



            iii.   On-site materials shall be used to grade
driveway access to the building pad.



            iv.   All retained and non-retained slopes shall
conform to the Grading and Excavations Chapter of the adopted Building Code.



         d.   If the applicant requests a building pad elevation
in excess of that allowed by the above criteria, a request for a variance
from the provisions of this section shall be submitted to the BOA pursuant to
division D. above.



         e.   A registered Arizona land surveyor shall certify
the final grade height.



      3.   Height of building site on downward sloping lots.



         a.   Lots with a major portion of the lot grade lying
below the base elevation may be filled to accommodate a building pad area no
more than 1 foot above the base elevation.



         b.   Fills shall be placed, watered, and compacted in
layers not to exceed 12-inch lifts, performed by a properly licensed testing
laboratory or Arizona registered professional engineer, certifying a minimum
of 90% of the maximum density as determined by the adopted Building Code
standards or equivalent.  A minimum of 3 locations shall be inspected for
compliance. All grading operations shall be done in a dust free manner and
shall comply with local, state, and federal laws regarding dust reduction.



      4.   Excavation safety measures.  Grading plans that include
slopes that exceed a 2:1 and depths that exceed 3 feet at any time during
construction activity shall include on the grading plan specific measures to
ensure that the excavations are protected from public encroachment. Measures
shall be approved by the Building Official and may include:



         a.   Physical barriers, including berms, temporary
fencing, or other suitable obstructions;



         b.   Warning lights, signs, or banners that will clearly
indicate the danger to trespassers of all ages; and



         c.   Where possible, stable trench coverings.



      5.   Conformance to adopted Building Code.  All grading
activities shall be in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
adopted Building Code and this Development Code.



      6.   Watershed preservation.  Planned or average lot grades
shall preserve the natural watershed.



      7.   Exploratory inspections.  In the event of grading
without a permit or inspections, exploratory inspections shall be performed
by an appropriate Arizona registered professional to ensure code compliance.
Substandard grading shall be evaluated and a report prepared with
recommendations for correction shall be submitted to the Building Official
for review and approval. Once approved, corrective measures shall be
performed under the direction of the engineer.



   F.   Temporary use permits.



      1.   Permit required.  Except for those exempt temporary uses
listed in division F.2.below, no temporary land use shall be established,
operated, or conducted unless a temporary use permit has first been approved
in compliance with this section.  The following 2 categories of temporary
uses identify the level of permit required, if any, based on the proposed
duration, size, and type of use:



         a.   Limited day or weekend temporary uses not to exceed
3 consecutive days identified in § 14.03.02.



         b.   Allowed temporary uses up to 30 days or as

exempt organizations in compliance with § 501(c) of the Federal Revenue and
Taxation Code.



         b.   On-site contractors’ construction yards, in
conjunction with an approved construction project on the same site.  The
construction yard shall be removed immediately upon completion of the
construction project, or the expiration of the companion building permit
authorizing the construction project, whichever first occurs.



         c.   Emergency public health and safety needs/land use
activities, as determined to be a true “emergency” by the Director.



         d.   Garage sales are exempt from the requirement for a

the date that the proposed use is scheduled to take place.



         d.   An application for a temporary use permit shall be
submitted for approval at least 15 days before the date that the proposed use
is scheduled to take place.



         e.   A public hearing shall not be required for a
decision on a temporary use permit.



      4.   Standards.



         a.   Standards for floor areas, heights, landscaping,
parking, setbacks, and other structure and property development standards
that apply to the category of use or the zoning district of the subject site
shall be used as a guide for determining the appropriate development
standards for temporary uses.



         b.   The Director may authorize an adjustment from the
specific standards deemed necessary or appropriate consistent with the
temporary nature of the use.



         c.   All materials and structures associated with the
temporary use shall be removed within 10 days after the actual termination of
operations, or after the expiration of the temporary use permit, whichever
first occurs.



         d.   A minimum of 30 days shall pass between the
issuance of a new temporary use permit and (1) the expiration of a similar
temporary use permit for the same property, or (2) the actual removal of the
materials and structures associated with the former use, whichever last
occurs.



         e.   Temporary uses may be subject to additional
licenses, inspections, or permits required by applicable local, state, or
federal requirements.



      5.    Findings and decision.  A temporary use permit may be
approved, modified, conditioned, or disapproved by the Director. The Director
may defer action and refer the application to the Commission for review and
decision at a scheduled public hearing. The Director may approve or
conditionally approve a temporary use permit application, only after first
finding that:



         a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the
use would not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental
to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
the neighborhood of the proposed use;



         b.   The use, as described and conditionally approved,
would not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the
neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city;



         c.   Approved measures for the removal of the use and
site restoration have been required to ensure that no changes to the site
would limit the range of possible future land uses otherwise allowed by this
Development Code;



         d.   Adequate provisions have been made for fire
protection, traffic access, parking, and circulation;



         e.   The use would meet all applicable county and state
health and sanitation requirements;



         f.   The time limit for the temporary use is the minimum
necessary to achieve the applicant’s intent; and



         g.   The temporary use would be compatible with the uses
allowed in the subject zoning district.



      6.   Conditions of approval.  In approving a temporary use
permit, the Director may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, hours of
operation, landscaping and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements,
parking, performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, time
limits, traffic circulation) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that
the approval would be in compliance with the findings required by division
F.5. above, and to preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare.



      7.   Condition of site following temporary use.  Each site
occupied by a temporary use shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or any other
evidence of the temporary use upon completion or removal of the use, and
shall thereafter be used in compliance with the provisions of this
Development Code. The review authority may require appropriate security
before initiation of the use to ensure proper cleanup after the use is
finished.



      8.   Post approval procedures.  The procedures relating to
appeals, changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this
Development Code shall apply following the approval of a temporary use permit.



   G.   Conditional use permits, minor and major.



      1.   Applicability.  A conditional use permit is required to
authorize proposed land uses and activities identified by § 14.03.02 as
being allowable in the applicable zoning district subject to the approval of
a conditional use permit.



      2.   Review authority.



         a.   The Director may approve a minor conditional use
permit for any use listed in § 14.03.02  as requiring a conditional use
permit where:



            i.   The proposed use involves less than 5,000
square feet of indoor space; and



            ii.   The proposed use involves less than 1 acre
of outdoor activity space; and



            iii.   The Director determines that the proposed
use will not have significant traffic or parking impacts on surrounding
properties.



         b.   If a proposed conditional use meets the criteria in
division G.2.a. above, but the Director determines that it includes unusual
site or performance features, the Director may defer action and refer the
application to the Commission for formal action.



         c.   The Commission may approve a major conditional use
permit for any use listed in § 14.03.02 as requiring a conditional use
permit, and that does not meet the criteria for action by the Director as a
minor conditional use in division G.2.a. above.



      3.   Application review, notice, and hearing.



         a.   Minor conditional use permit.  The Director may
approve a minor conditional use permit without a hearing if the Director
determines that it meets the required findings in division G.4. below.



         b.   Major conditional use permit.



            i.   The Director shall review each major

hearing on an application for a conditional use permit, pursuant to §§
14.05.03G. and 14.05.03H. before the approval or disapproval of the permit.



      4.   Findings and decision.  The review authority may approve
or disapprove an application for a minor or major conditional use permit and
shall record the decision and the findings upon which the decision is based.
The review authority may approve the permit only after first finding that:



         a.   The proposed use is allowed with a minor or major
conditional use permit, as appropriate to the request, within the applicable
zoning district and complies with all applicable provisions of this
Development Code;



         b.   The proposed use is consistent with the goals and
policies of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan;



         c.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the
use would not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental
to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
the neighborhood of the proposed use;



         d.   The use, as described and conditionally approved,
would not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the
neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city;



         e.   The subject site is adequate in terms of size,
shape, topography, and circumstances and has sufficient access to streets and
highways that are adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity
and quality of traffic expected to be generated by the proposed use; and



         f.   The design, location, operating characteristics,
and size of the proposed use would be compatible with the existing and future
land uses in the vicinity, in terms of aesthetic values, character, scale,
and view protection.



      5.   Conditions of approval.  In approving a permit, the
review authority may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, hours of operation,
landscaping and maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking,
performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, time limits,
traffic circulation) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the
approval would be in compliance with the findings required by division G.4.
above, and to preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare.



      6.   Post approval procedures.  The procedures relating to
appeals, changes, expiration, performance guarantees, and revocation in this
Development Code shall apply following the approval of a temporary use permit.



   H.   Site/design review.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to provide
procedures for the review and approval/ disapproval of site/design review
applications in order to guide the physical development of the city,
consistent with good site and architectural principles. Specific objectives

site/design review application and supporting documents required by this
section. The Director shall waive the requirements identified in this
division H.4. in those cases where an applicant does not plan the
construction of structures upon the real property proposed to be subdivided.



      5.   Construction consistent with approved plans required. 
All construction, site development, and landscaping shall be carried out in
substantial compliance with the drawings, plans, sketches, and other
documents approved in compliance with this division H., unless a change to
those plans is approved pursuant to § 14.05.03N.



      6.   Procedure.

a period of 12 months from the effective date of the approval.



         b.   If, at the end of that time, construction has not
begun in compliance with § 14.05.03L., site/design review approval shall
expire and shall be in effect only if resubmitted for approval in compliance
with this division H.



         c.   Any departure from the approved plans shall be
cause for revocation of the building permit, disapproval of an occupancy
permit, or revocation of an occupancy permit, unless the changes are approved
in advance, in compliance with § 14.05.03N.



      11.   Conditions of approval.  In approving a design review,
the Director may impose conditions (e.g., buffers, landscaping and
maintenance, lighting, off-site improvements, parking, performance
guarantees, property maintenance, signs, surfacing, traffic circulation
deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would be in
compliance with the purpose and provisions of this section, and to preserve
the public health, safety, and general welfare.

         ii.   An application for modification of an existing
parking-in-common plan shall be submitted by 75% of the property owners for
which it currently provides off-street parking required by § 14.04.02, as

      c.   Criteria and decision.  The Commission may approve a
parking-in-common plan, or a modification of an existing parking-in-common
plan, if it makes the following findings:



         i.   The proposed plan or modification will provide
adequate off-street parking for the included property owners, taking into
account the minimum off-street parking requirements of § 14.04.02 and any
potential sharing of spaces among the included property owners based on
differences in peak hour parking demands and the variety of land uses to be
covered by the application.



         ii.   Approval of the proposed plan or modification will
not increase traffic congestion on public or private streets near the
included properties or on any property containing a residential land use
within 300 feet of the included properties.



         iii.   Approval of the proposed plan or modification
will not result in any property becoming nonconforming with regard to
required off-street parking, unless that property owner consents in writing
to the creation of that nonconformity.



   J.   Abandonment of easements.



      1.   Procedure.



         a.   Preapplication conference required.  A prospective
applicant for an abandonment of easement shall schedule a preapplication
conference with the Director for the purpose of reviewing procedural and
review requirements necessary to carry out the applicant’s request for
abandonment.



         b.   All costs to be borne by applicant.  All costs
associated with the abandonment shall be borne by the applicant.



         c.   State and agency review.  Upon acceptance of the
application, the Director shall transmit the application materials to
appropriate review agencies and staff departments.



         d.   Council approval required.  The Director shall
transmit a copy of the application materials, Department findings and
recommendations to the Council, which shall act to approve, approve with
modifications, or disapprove the application, in compliance with division
J.2. below.



      2.   Conditions, findings, and decision.  In order for an
easement to be abandoned, the following conditions and findings shall apply:



         a.   Guying requirements.  Where there is a 10-foot by
50-foot guying requirement on the public utility easement (PUE) for the
specific purpose of guying a utility pole, abandonment of a 10-foot by
25-foot portion may be considered.



         b.   Relocation of easement.  In association with the
combination of lots, consideration may be given to the relocation of an
existing PUE to another location within the affected lots. However, it shall
be noted that in many cases these PUEs cannot be relocated due to existing
facilities or due to the location of the existing PUE being contiguous with
other PUEs within the area.



         c.   Written approval required.  Written approval from
all affected utility companies shall be necessary before the abandonment is
approved.



         d.   Findings.  Unless it is determined that the
easement and utility services or drainage facilities can be properly
relocated, the following findings shall be made before Council approval of a
request to abandon. The easement shall not:



            i.   Contain utility lines of any nature in that
portion to be abandoned;



            ii.   Be used to convey street run-off waters to
established wash facilities; and



            iii.   Be required for future systems expansion by
any public or private utility.

comment on the modification(s).



         d.   Incomplete citizen review plan and/or report.  If
the citizen review plan and/or report do not meet the requirements identified
above, the application for the Zoning Map amendment shall be considered
incomplete and shall not be scheduled for public hearing.

§ 14.05.05  PRE-EXISTING DEVELOPMENT AND NONCONFORMITIES.



   A.   Purpose.  Within the zoning districts established by this
Development Code, there exist land uses, structures, and parcels that were
lawful at the time they were established, constructed, or formed, but that are



now prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the terms of this
Development Code. This section establishes uniform provisions for the
regulation of these legal nonconforming land uses, structures, and parcels.
In addition, § 14.02.06B. includes additional regulations that apply to
nonconformities in the Airport Overlay District.



   B.   Nonconforming structures.



      1.   Continuation.  A nonconforming structure may be
continued, transferred, or sold; and may undergo normal and necessary
maintenance and repairs; provided that no structural alterations are made.



      2.   Loss of status through substantial damage.



         a.   If a nonconforming structure or a conforming
structure used for a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed due to a
catastrophic event and the cost of repairing or replacing the structure is
greater than 50% of the current appraised value of the structure as shown on
the County Assessor’s records, or as established by a state licensed
appraiser, the right to continue occupancy of the nonconforming structure or
to continue the nonconforming use shall cease.



         b.   If the cost of repairing or replacing the structure
does not exceed 50% of the current appraised value of the structure, as shown
in the County Assessor’s records or established by a state licensed
appraiser, the structure may be restored and the use continued if the
restoration is started within 1 year of the date of damage or destruction and
is completed within 2 years of the date of damage or destruction.



      3.   Exemption for residential units.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of division B.2. above, nonconforming single-, 2- and multi-family
residential dwelling units damaged or destroyed due to a catastrophic event
may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure(s) using the same
development standards applied to the damaged or destroyed structure(s) if
completed within 1 year of the catastrophic event. The new construction shall
comply with the current building and fire code requirements.



      4.   Special provision for MU-UMS and R-UMS Districts.  A
nonconforming building or other structure may be allowed a tenant improvement
or added to, provided 50% or more of the existing floor area or 50% of the

reconstruction, or use of any structure.



      2.   Other city officials.  All officials of the city charged
by the law with the general duty of enforcing city codes and ordinances shall
also enforce the provisions of this Development Code.



   C.   General provisions.



      1.   Permits and licenses.  All departments, officials, and
public employees of the city who are assigned the authority or duty to issue
permits or licenses shall comply with state law (A.R.S. § 9-462.05) and the
provisions of this Development Code.  Permits for uses or structures that
would be in conflict with the provisions of this Development Code shall not
be issued. Any permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this
Development Code shall be deemed void.  Any action taken by an official or
public employee of the city in conflict with the provisions of this
Development Code shall be deemed void.



      2.   Inspections.



         a.   Preapproval inspections.  Every applicant seeking
a permit or any other action in compliance with this Development Code shall
allow the city officials handling the application access to any premises or
property that is the subject of the application.



         b.   Post approval inspections.  If the permit or other
action is approved, the owner or applicant shall allow appropriate city
officials access to the premises in order to determine continued compliance
with the approved permit and/or any conditions of approval imposed on the
permit.



      3.   Responsible party.  The owner and/or person in
possession of any property used in violation of this Development Code are
responsible for any prohibited act(s) or violation(s) on the subject property.



         a.   Owner's responsibility.  The owner's
responsibility applies whether or not the owner, or agent, is aware of the
prohibited act(s), has committed the prohibited act(s), or has neglected to
prevent the performance of the prohibited act(s) by another person(s).



         b.   Person in possession's responsibility.  The person
in possession's responsibility applies whether or not the person in
possession, or agent, is aware of the prohibited act(s), has committed the
prohibited act(s), or has neglected to prevent the performance of the
prohibited act(s) by another person(s).



      4.   Additional permit processing fees.  Any person who
alters, constructs, converts, enlarges, erects, establishes, installs,
maintains, moves, or operates any land use or structure without first
obtaining a permit or entitlement required by this Development Code, shall

resolution for the correction of the violation(s), before being granted a
permit for a use or structure on the site.



   D.   Administrative remedies.



      1.   Permit revocation or modification.  This section
provides procedures for securing punitive revocation or modification of
previously approved land use permits or entitlements. The city's action to
revoke an entitlement shall have the effect of terminating the entitlement
and denying the privileges granted by the original approval.  The city's
action to modify an entitlement, rather than to revoke it, shall have the
effect of changing the operational aspects of the entitlement; the changes
included in a modification the operational aspects related to buffers,
duration of the entitlement, hours of operation, landscaping and maintenance,
lighting, parking, performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs,
surfacing, traffic circulation, and the like.



      2.   Hearings and notice.



         a.   Upon violation of any applicable provision of this

of the Zoning Administrator, in compliance with this section.



         b.   The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice
to the applicant of the intent to suspend or revoke the permit and provide
the basis for the suspension or revocation.



         c.   The applicant shall have 30 days from the date of
the Zoning Administrator's notification to take remedial actions to correct
the conditions of suspension or revocation.

Zoning Administrator shall conduct a re-inspection, and if not satisfied that
the basis for the suspension is being complied with, may revoke the permit.



         e.   The applicant, within 30 days from the date of the
Zoning Administrator's notification to revoke the permit, may file an appeal
to the BOA in compliance with § 14.05.03.O.



         f.   The applicant may also appeal the BOA determination
to the Council, in compliance with § 14.05.03.O.



      3.   Review authority's action.



         a.   A land use permit, minor variance, major variance,
or entitlement may be revoked or modified by the review authority that
originally approved the permit, minor variance, major variance, or
entitlement if any 1 of the following findings of fact can be made in a
positive manner:



            i.   Circumstances under which the permit was
granted have been changed by the applicant to a degree that 1 or more of the
findings contained in the original permit can no longer be made in a positive
manner and the public health, safety, and welfare require the revocation;



            ii.   The permit was issued, in whole or in part,

the application, or in the applicant's testimony presented during the public
hearing for the permit;

have not been substantially fulfilled or have been violated;



            iv.   The improvement authorized in compliance
with the permit is in violation of any code, law, ordinance, regulation, or
statute; or



            v.   The improvement/use allowed by the permit has
become detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or the manner of
operation constitutes or is creating a public nuisance.



         b.   In addition to finding that at least 1 of the
findings in division D.3.a. can be made in a positive manner, in order to
modify or revoke a minor or major variance, the reviewing authority must also
make a finding that the grantee has not substantially exercised the rights
granted by the minor or major variance.



   E.   Legal remedies.  In addition to, or in lieu of, pursuing the
administrative remedies in division D above, a violation of this title may be
enforced as described in Chapter 1.12 of this Code.
