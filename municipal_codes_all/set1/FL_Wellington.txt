PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Wellington, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the village council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Charles Schoeck, Village Attorney, and Ms. Awilda Rodriguez, Village Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Editor's note Printed herein is Laws of Fla., ch. 95-496, as adopted by the state legislature. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation.

Section 1. - Short title. 
This act, together with any future amendments thereto, shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of Wellington Charter," hereinafter referred to as "the charter."

Pursuant thereto: 
a.  During the period of suspension, the mayor or any councilmember shall not perform any official act, duty, or function, or receive any pay, allowance, emolument, or privilege of office. 
b.  If the mayor or any councilmember is subsequently found not guilty of the charge, or if the charge is otherwise dismissed, reduced, or altered in such a manner that suspension would no longer be required as provided herein, the suspension shall be lifted and the mayor or any councilmember shall be entitled to receive full back pay and such other emoluments or allowances as he or she would have been entitled to had the suspension not occurred. 
4.  Filling of vacancies. If any vacancy occurs in the office of mayor or councilmember, and less than 180 days remain in the term, such seat shall remain vacant until a new mayor or councilmember is elected and assumes the duties of his or her office.

2.  Commencement of proceedings. Any 10 electors may commence initiative or referendum proceedings by filing with the village clerk an affidavit stating that they shall constitute the petitioner's committee and be responsible for circulating the petition and filing it in proper form stating their names and addresses and specifying the address to which all notices to the committee are to be sent, and setting out in full the proposed initiative ordinance or citing the ordinance sought to be reconsidered.

Except as otherwise provided in section 9.I.1.a.(2), all initiative and referendum petitions must be filed within 60 days of the date on which proceedings with respect to such initiative or referendum are commenced, and all requirements of the process, including, but not limited to, the submission of the signatures required, must be completed no later than 90 days following the date of filing said initiative or referendum petition. 
4.  Procedure for filing. 
a.  [ Generally. ] Within 20 days after an initiative petition or a referendum petition is filed, the village clerk shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency, specifying, if it is insufficient, the particulars wherein it is defective and shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the petitioner's committee by registered mail. Grounds for insufficiency are only those specifics in section 9.I.3.c. that are not met. A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioner's committee files a notice of intent to amend it with the designated official within 2 business days after receiving the copy of the certificate and files a supplementary petition upon additional papers within 10 days after receiving the copy of such certificate. Such supplementary petition shall comply with original petition requirements, and within 5 days after it is filed, the village clerk shall complete a certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition as amended and promptly send a copy of such certificate to the petitioner's committee by registered mail. If a petition or an amended petition is certified sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition is certified insufficient and the petitioner's committee does not elect to amend or request the village council review under section 9.I.4.b. within the time required, the village clerk shall promptly present a certificate to the village council and such certificate shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
b.  The village council review. If a petition has been certified insufficient and the petitioner's committee does not file notice of intent to amend it or if an amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within two (2) business days after receiving the copy of such certificate, file a request that it be reviewed by the village council. The village council shall review the certificate at its next meeting following the village council's filing of such request and approve or disapprove it, and determination shall then be final as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
5.  Action on petitions. 
a.  Action by the village council. When an initiative or referendum petition has been determined sufficient, the village council shall promptly consider the proposed initiative ordinance or reconsider the referendum ordinance by voting its repeal. The repeal of an ordinance relating to the levy of ad valorem taxes shall be by ordinance. If the village council fails to adopt a proposed initiative ordinance without any change in substance within 45 days or fails to repeal the referendum ordinance within 30 days or, in the case of a referendum authorized pursuant to section 9.I.1.b.(3), within 5 days after the date on which the petition is determined to be sufficient, it shall submit the proposed initiative or referendum ordinance to the electors of the village. If the village council fails to act on a proposed initiative ordinance or a referendum ordinance within the time period specified, the village council shall be deemed to have failed to adopt the proposed initiative ordinance or failed to repeal the referendum ordinance on the last day that the village council was authorized to act on such matter. 
b.  Submission to electors. The vote of the village on a proposed initiative or referendum ordinance shall be held not less than 30 or more than 60 days from the date the village council acted or was deemed to have acted pursuant to section 9.I.5.a. that the petition was determined sufficient. If no regular election is to be held within the period described in this paragraph, the village council shall provide for a special election, except that the village council may, in its discretion, provide for a special election at an earlier date within the described period. Copies of the proposed initiative or referendum ordinance shall be made available at the polls. 
c.  Withdrawal of petitions. An initiative or referendum petition may be withdrawn at any time prior to the 15th day preceding the day scheduled for a vote of the village by filing with the village clerk a request for withdrawal signed by at least eight members of the petitioner's committee. Upon the filing of such request, the petition shall have no further force or effect and all proceedings thereon shall be terminated. 
6.  Results of election. 
a.  Initiative. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a proposed initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adopted upon certification of the election results. If conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
b.  [ Repeal. ] If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a referendum ordinance vote against it, it shall be considered repealed upon certification of the election results.

General guidelines for travel and training expenses are as follows: 
(1)  Travel and training expenses shall reflect correct and complete expenditures (registration fees, lodging, transportation, etc.) that were incurred by the requesting party and shall be reported to Financial Services within a reasonable amount of time in order to avoid taxation per the Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. 
(2)  No reimbursement shall be allowed where those costs are incurred and accounted by another person (i.e., two persons traveling in one vehicle cannot claim duplicate mileage/travel costs). 
(3)  Subsistence may be reduced for any meals or lodging included in the conference, seminar or meeting registration. 
(4)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for the spouse (or any other traveling companion) of the village council or village staff.

Sec. 2-129. - Travel advances. 
The village does provide travel advances for travelers who provide the appropriate documentation to financial services within a reasonable amount of time as outlined by IRS guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 2014-01A, § 1, 5-13-14)  
Sec. 2-130. - Sales tax exemption; reasonable expenses for lodging, meals, transportation and services. 
Per diem reimbursement for meals shall be in accordance with the Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as currently applicable and as these rates are periodically amended, meaning when the rates change, the village rate will automatically change accordingly. 
(1)  No receipts are required for per diem rates. Meals which exceed these limits by reason of location or type of function will be reimbursed if receipts are provided, and the exception shall be approved by the village manager or designee. Conference or seminar banquets and lunches in excess of the per meal allowance are allowable exceptions; however, these must be noted on the program or agenda. 
(2)  Traveler may opt out of meals that are included in the conference, seminar or meeting registration, only if documented to serve a business/public purpose. Opting out of an already paid for (included in registration) meal will not be reimbursed. Receipts and proper documentation must be submitted and approved by village manager or designee. 
(3)  Payments for group meals while traveling require a written explanation attached to the receipt. The village reserves the right to withhold any meal reimbursement not having sufficient proof of actual expenditures and a valid reason of public purpose. 
(4)  Tips will be reimbursed on a reasonable and customary basis, and include but are not limited to meals, baggage handling, transportation, valet and porter.

Sec. 2-132. - Transportation. 
All travel must be by a usually traveled route. In case a person travels by an indirect route for his or her own convenience, any extra costs shall be borne by the traveler and reimbursement for expenses shall be based only on such charges as would have been incurred by a usually traveled route. The department head or his or her designee shall designate the most economical method of travel for each trip, keeping in mind the following conditions: 
(1)  The nature of the business. 
(2)  The most efficient and economical means of travel (considering time of the traveler, impact on the productivity of the traveler, cost of transportation and per diem or subsistence required). When it is more efficient and economical to either the traveler or village, jet service offered by any airline may be used when the cost is within an approved threshold determined by the department head or designee. 
(3)  The number of persons making the trip and the amount of equipment or material to be transported. 
(a)  Airfare. Take advantage of special rates, when available. 
(b)  Mileage. The rate of reimbursement for the use of a personal car will be in accordance with the most current standard mileage rate of Department of Treasury IRS Publication 463 "Travel, Entertainment, Gifts and Car Expense". Reimbursement shall generally not exceed the reasonable cost of commercial airfare, including transportation to and from the airport.

(5)  Rebut evidence. 
(f)  Representation of alleged violator. The alleged violator has the right to be represented by an attorney at all hearings before the special magistrate. 
(g)  Evidence. All relevant evidence shall be admitted if, in the opinion of the special magistrate, it is the type of evidence upon which reasonable and responsible persons would normally rely in the conduct of business affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make such evidence inadmissible over objections in civil actions. The special magistrate may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but such hearsay evidence shall not in and of itself be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision unless the evidence would be admissible over objections in a civil action. 
(h)  Findings of fact; issuance of orders. At the conclusion of the hearing, special magistrate shall issue findings of fact based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this article.

(i)  Motions for rehearing or reconsideration of orders. Motions for rehearing, motions for reconsideration, or any other motion that seeks to have the special magistrate overturn a previously issued order are not permitted and shall not be considered by a special magistrate.

State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.07(4).  
Sec. 2-199. - Fines; imposition of liens. 
(a)  The special magistrate, upon notification by the code inspector that a previous order of the enforcement board or special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time, may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed $250.00 for each day that the violation continues past the date set for compliance for a first violation, or in the case of a repeat violation may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each day the violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the special magistrate shall notify the village council, which may make all repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the cost of the repairs as part of the fine imposed pursuant to this article. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. It may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property. A fine imposed pursuant to this article shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to F.S. § 162.09, whichever occurs first. Once a violator comes into compliance, the violator may request a reduction of the fine from the special magistrate. In making the determination on whether to reduce a fine, following compliance, the special magistrate may take into consideration the gravity of the violation, any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation, any previous or subsequent violations committed by the violator, whether there was intervening matters that prevented or obstructed the violator from timely complying with the order to correct the violation, and/or the financial ability of the violator to pay the full amount of the fine. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this article runs in favor of the village council, and the village council may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this article. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the village attorney to foreclose on the lien, or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien, plus accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under section 4, article X of the state constitution.

In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the action. The village council shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien.

Sec. 2-292. - Removal of board and committee members. 
(a)  Removal based on absenteeism. Active participation by members of the boards and committees is essential to the effectiveness of the board or committee operations. It is therefore necessary for members to attend the meetings as frequently as possible. As important as participation and attendance is, Wellington's Council understands that a member's activities and other obligations of either a personal or professional nature will on occasion take precedence over their participation in board or committee activities. If a member recognizes they will not be able to fully and regularly participate in the board or committee meetings they should resign from the board or committee and allow the council to fill the vacancy created by their resignation. In order to maintain a standard of commitment from the members they shall be subject to removal from their position as a member of a board or committee under the following circumstances. Any member of a board or committee, during the course of their two-year term, who has two consecutive unexcused absences or four absences out of the last six meetings, whether excused or unexcused, from regular meetings shall be automatically removed as a member of the respective board or committee. For purposes of this section, the term "excused absence" shall mean: (i) illness of a board or committee member or other person for whom the member is a caregiver; (ii) death of a board or committee member's relative; (iii) observance of religious holidays; (iv) compliance with a subpoena or other legal process; and (v) absence resulting from events reasonably beyond the control of the board or committee member. The member removed for absenteeism shall be ineligible for reappointment to a board or committee for a period of two years following the effective date of their removal. 
(b)  Removal for reasons other than absenteeism and failure to maintain the requirements for being a board member. All board and committee members shall serve at the pleasure of the Wellington Council. Board and committee members appointed by individual Council members may be removed without cause by the Council member who appointed the board or committee member unless otherwise provided by the Charter or Florida Statutes. No vote by the Wellington Council shall be required for such removal. At large board and committee members may be removed by a majority vote of the Council, unless otherwise provided by the Charter or Florida Statutes. Any member so removed shall have no right to request a hearing before the Wellington Council. 
(1)  Hearing; decision of council. Any request for hearing must be filed with the Wellington Clerk within five days of the date of the decision to remove. Upon the timely request of the member for a hearing before the Wellington Council, the council shall set a date and time for a hearing and direct the Wellington Clerk to give the member notice of the hearing. Such hearing shall be held no later than 30 days from receipt of a request for a hearing. At the hearing, the member may present evidence and argument as to why he/she should not be removed. The decision of the council may be to remove, to suspend, to reprimand, or to absolve the member. 
(2)  [Effective date of removal.] The effective date of removal of a member shall be immediately after the expiration of the time in which the member has the right to request a hearing before the Wellington Council, or any later date which the Wellington Council may provide, unless the member timely requests a hearing before the Wellington Council. If the member requests a hearing, the member shall continue to serve on the board or committee until conclusion of the hearing or withdrawal of the request. If the member timely requests a hearing, and the Wellington Council decides to remove the member upon the conclusion of the hearing, the removal shall take effect immediately unless the Wellington Council specifies a later date. If a member timely requests a hearing but withdraws the request prior to the hearing, the effective date shall be the date on which the request is withdrawn.

Sec. 3-3. - Declaration of intent; notice. 
(a)  Whenever the village shall decide that a special assessment service or project needs to be provided or accomplished, the village council shall by resolution (the "intent resolution") declare the village's intention to have such work performed or services provided, designating the nature of the work or services; the location of the work or services; the part or portion of the cost to be paid by special assessment; the manner in which special assessments shall be made; when such assessments are to be paid; and what part, if any, shall be apportioned to be paid from other funds of the village or another participating governmental unit(s). Such intent resolution shall also describe the lands on which the special assessment is to be levied and it shall be sufficient to describe such lands as all lots and lands located within the assessable area receiving special benefit from the service or project. Such intent resolution shall also state the estimated costs of the service or project. The resolution may be adopted prior to or within one year of the completion of construction of the assessment or service or project and if the work is completed, the actual costs of the service or project shall be stated within the body of the resolution. 
(b)  At the time of the adoption of the intent resolution there shall be on file with the village clerk an assessment plat showing the area to be assessed, together with preliminary plans and specifications and an estimate of the total or annual cost for the service or project, which assessment plat, preliminary plans and specifications, and estimate shall be open to the inspection of the public. 
(c)  Upon adoption of the intent resolution, if not done previously, the village may advertise for bids, provide in-house or provide pursuant to an agreement with a third party or another public agency or a publicly regulated utility agency to provide the service or for the construction of the project. If bid, the bid shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and include in such advertisement the intent resolution number and title. All such bids shall conform to the village bid procedures then in effect. 
(d)  Promptly after adoption of the intent resolution, the village clerk shall cause said intent resolution to be published by title once a week for a period of two weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the village and in Palm Beach County, Florida. The notice of the intent resolution shall provide that the complete resolution is available for review and copying at the office of the village clerk during normal business hours. 
(e)  Whenever it is necessary for the village to adopt an assessment roll on an annual basis, it shall not be necessary to adopt an intent resolution each year. Instead, in subsequent years, the village shall adopt a preliminary assessment resolution, which shall provide for the purpose of the special assessment and the preliminary amount of such assessment. The preliminary assessment resolution may also provide for the date, time and place of the public hearing required by section 3-5, and any other information the village deems necessary. The preliminary assessment resolution need not be published subsequent to adoption. If the original assessment resolution provided for payments over a period of years and there is no change to the amount or period of assessment from the original resolution, no subsequent annual resolution is necessary. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-4. - Setting assessments for special assessment improvements or service program. 
(a)  Determining basis for assessment. The village shall determine the assessable area; assessable front footage; or assessable value, for each special assessment service or project and shall prepare an assessment roll (the "preliminary assessment roll") in accordance with the method of assessment set out in the intent resolution. Such preliminary assessment roll shall show the lots and lands to be assessed and, after taken into consideration the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the amount of each assessment and the total assessment. 
(b)  Determining assessable cost her property owner for property located in the assessable area. The estimated annual cost or total cost, which ever is applicable, for the service or project shall be used to develop a formula to determine the basis for assessment in order to attribute cost per property owner for property located within the assessable area. The assessable cost for each property owner for property located in the assessable area shall then be added together to arrive at the total assessment. 
(c)  Annual determination of cost for a service. The estimated cost of a service funded by a special assessment levied pursuant to this chapter shall be set annually by resolution of the village council after notice and public hearing, if the estimated annual cost for the upcoming year exceeds the current annual assessment amount. If the estimated annual cost for the upcoming year does not exceed the current annual assessment amount then notice and public hearing shall not be required but the village council will set the amount of the annual assessment by resolution at a public meeting. Whenever a public hearing is required by this section, the public hearing held by the village pursuant to section 3-5 shall satisfy the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-5. - Levying special assessment. 
(a)  Upon completion of the preliminary assessment roll, the village shall by resolution or motion fix a time and place at which the owners of property to be assessed, or any other persons interested therein, may appear before the village and be heard with respect to the propriety and advisability of providing the service or project and funding them with special assessments, the cost of the service or project, and the amount to be assessed against each property so improved or serviced. The village clerk shall provide written notice of such hearing to each of the property owners whose property is subject to being assessed. Such notice shall be provided by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid, or through the annual TRIM Notices forwarded by the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser, not less than 20 days in advance of the hearing. The notice by mail shall include the following information: the purpose of the assessment; the total amount to be levied against each parcel; the unit of measurement to be applied against each parcel to determine the assessment; the number of such units contained within each parcel; the total revenue the local government will collect by the assessment; a statement that failure to pay the assessment will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the property which may result in a loss of title; a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the hearing and to file written objections with the village within 20 days of the notice; and the date, time, and place of the hearing. In addition, notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the village not less than 20 days in advance of the hearing; provided however, that any mistake in such advertised notice or in any mailed notice shall not void any assessment levied in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The published notice shall contain at least the following information: the name of the village; a geographic depiction of the property subject to the assessment; the proposed schedule of the assessment; the fact that the assessment will be collected by the tax collector or the village directly; and a statement that all affected property owners have the right to appear at the public hearing and the right to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. The resolution or motion shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing, describe the assessable area, and advise persons interested that the description of the properties located within the assessable area and the amount of the assessment can be ascertained at the office of the village clerk. 
(b)  At such public hearing, the village council shall consider all objections relating to the assessments and shall make a final decision on whether to levy the special assessments. Thereafter, if the decision is to levy the special assessments, the village council shall equalize or adjust such assessments where justice and right so dictate, and shall approve and confirm the assessment roll by resolution (the "assessment resolution"). When so equalized and approved, a final assessment roll shall be filed in the office of the village clerk of the village and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid, and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid. The annual assessment amount for a service shall be determined by village in accordance with section 3-4 (c) shall be filed in the office of the village clerk of the village, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid. 
(c)  A statement of the confirmed assessment shall be provided to each property owner listed on the roll. The property owner shall have such time as may be provided in the assessment within which to pay the total or annual assessment. 
(d)  The village shall determine in the assessment resolution when the payment of any special assessment levied pursuant to this chapter shall commence, and the frequency and amount of any scheduled collections of such assessments upon determination of the confirmed assessment roll. 
(e)  Upon completion of a project or termination of a service, any excess in the special assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed over the actual cost of the improvement to be paid by such special assessment, shall be credited proportionately against each special assessment against each parcel in the manner set forth in the assessment resolution, or used for any lawful purpose. 
(f)  The village council shall be authorized to revise and correct errors and omissions in the assessment roll if: 
(1)  Any assessment made under this chapter is annulled, vacated, or set aside, in whole or in part, by the judgment of any court. In such a case, the village council may revise the assessment to comport with the guidelines of any such judgment until such time as a valid assessment is imposed. 
(2)  The village council is satisfied that any assessment is so defective that it can not be enforced or collected. 
(3)  The village council has omitted any property from the assessment roll which should have been assessed for the service or project funded by the assessment. 
(g)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector, the mayor, or his or her designee, shall be authorized to reclassify any property subject to the assessment based upon competent substantial evidence, or to correct any error in applying the assessment upon any particular parcel, either on his or her own initiative or upon receipt of a timely filed written petition by a property owner. 
(h)  No error or omission by the village council, mayor or any of his or her designees, village administrator, property appraiser, tax collector, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the village council under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-6. - Partial year assessments. 
A partial year assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption of the assessment resolution for any special assessment levied pursuant to this chapter. The amount of the partial year assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the assessment resolution for the calendar year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the calendar year. In addition to the monthly rate, the partial year assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent calendar year's assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the partial year assessment is received by the village. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the partial year assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such partial year assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-7. - Collection of payments; installment payments; certificate of indebtedness. 
(a)  Notice of assessment. Promptly after adoption of the assessment resolution, a statement of the confirmed assessment shall be provided to each property owner listed on the confirmed roll. The special assessments shall bear interest and be payable at the time and in the manner stipulated in the assessment resolution, and shall remain liens, co-equal with the lien of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, other non-ad valorem assessments which are duly levied, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims, until paid. The village may elect to collect its own assessments, retain a third party to collect, use the uniform method or use any other legally available mechanism for collection. 
(b)  Installment payments. The assessment, subject to the interest provided in this section, may be satisfied through weekly, monthly or annual installments as provided for in the assessment resolution. All assessments, together with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, may be paid in full at any time and the property owner shall not incur any penalty for prepayment. 
(c)  Certificate issued for failure to pay assessment. Where assessments are not paid within the time provided in the assessment resolution, a certificate of indebtedness shall be issued. The certificate shall contain a description of the assessed property, the amount of the assessment, a description of the service or project, and shall identify the assessment resolution under which the assessment was made. Such certificate shall be recorded in the public records of Palm Beach County and shall constitute a lien coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and other municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid, and shall bear interest at a rate to be set forth in the assessment resolution. 
(d)  Enforcement of certificate. Upon failure of the property owner to pay any assessment installment due, any part thereof, or any interest, the procedures and remedies of the uniform method shall apply if used by village, if not then the village, or its agent, may cause the necessary proceedings to be brought to enforce payment of either the assessment or the certificate issued under section 2-76(c), together with all accrued interest. As a part of such proceeding, the village shall be entitled to recover all costs and a reasonable attorney's fee. Default in the payment of any installment of the assessment or accrued interest shall result in the entire or annual assessment, if applicable, plus interest becoming immediately due. Such foreclosure proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted under F.S. Chs. 43 and 173, or as otherwise provided by law. 
(e)  Validity. In no event shall the amount or validity of the lien or certificate of indebtedness as provided for by this chapter be questioned in any direct or collateral proceeding instituted more than 30 days after the issuance of such certificate of indebtedness by the village, or such shorter time as may result from the filing of bond validation proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-8. - Issuance of bonds. 
The village may at any time without an election being held therefore borrow money and issue bonds therefore in anticipation of the collection of unpaid special assessments levied or to be levied for the purpose of paying the cost of special assessment service or project. 
(Ord. No. 2005-12, § 1, 5-10-05)  
Sec. 3-9. - Prepayment of special assessments. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of F.S. § 170.09, section 3-7(b) of this chapter or any other provision of law pertaining to the prepayment of special assessments, the village council may, in its discretion, by enabling resolution(s), provide for restrictions or limitations on the prepayment of special assessments levied by the village.

Sec. 6-3. - Public possession or consumption. 
(a)  Definitions. In this section, the following terms and phrases shall have the meanings set forth in this subsection, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
Alcoholic beverage means any beverage containing one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume, as determined in accordance with F.S. § 561.01(4)(b). 
Beverage law means F.S. chs. 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 567, 568. 
Commercial establishment parking lot means any private or public area appurtenant to commercial establishments used by the public for parking for, and pedestrian access to, commercial establishments, including drives, parking areas and sidewalks and walkways appurtenant thereto. 
Container means any can, bottle, carton or other vessel of alcoholic beverage. 
Public or semipublic area open for vehicular travel means all public and private roads, streets, highways, lanes, alleys, parking lots and parking areas on which the public is expressly or implicitly invited to travel by motor vehicle or which is otherwise open for vehicular travel. The term does not include:

(2)  Private driveways or property serving a single dwelling unit. 
(b)  Findings of fact. The uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic beverages in and around commercial establishment parking lots contributes to lewd behavior, verbal harassment, intoxicated disorderly conduct, destruction of property, excessive noise and litter. The uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic beverages in and around commercial establishment parking lots has led to an increase in the number of violent crimes committed on and near those commercial establishment parking lots. Individuals consuming alcoholic beverages in and around commercial establishment parking lots deter the public's use and enjoyment of these areas. No effective means exists to deter the violent, disorderly, destructive or offensive conduct associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages in and around uncontrolled commercial establishment parking lots other than to prohibit the consumption of alcohol in those areas. 
(c)  Consumption prohibited in parking lots; exceptions. It shall be unlawful for any person to drink or consume any alcoholic beverage in or within 500 feet of a commercial establishment parking lot in the village, except in those areas in which such consumption is permitted pursuant to the Beverage Law, special or general act of the state, the Florida Administrative Code, or village ordinance, resolution, or administrative approval. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit consumption on private property within 500 feet of a commercial establishment parking lot; provided, however, that the owner or person in control of the private property has explicitly consented to such consumption. 
(d)  Possession in parking lots prohibited; exception. It shall be unlawful for any person to possess any alcoholic beverage in or within 500 feet of a commercial establishment parking lot in the village except in those areas in which such possession is permitted pursuant to the Beverage Law, special or general act of the state legislature, the Florida Administrative Code, or village ordinance, resolution or administrative approval unless such alcoholic beverage is in the original container with the seal unbroken. 
(e)  Exemptions. This section shall not apply to: 
(1)  Any person engaged in picking up empty beverage containers for the purpose of collecting the deposit or value of the bottle or can itself, nor to any person taking part in a litter control campaign; or 
(2)  The possession of any open container by any licensed distributor or licensed vendor of alcoholic beverages, provided that such alcoholic beverage is being transported solely for commercial purposes. 
(f)  Enforcement of section. It shall be the duty and responsibility of all appropriate law enforcement officers to enforce the provisions of this section.

Such areas may include, but are not exclusive to, family picnic areas, areas reserved for large group picnics, and facilities for food service. In determining whether an area should be designated for the consumption of alcoholic beverages or whether a designation should remain, the director may consider, among other factors, the general use of the area under consideration and nearby areas, the hours during which the park is open, the conduct of persons utilizing the area so designated or under consideration for designation and nearby areas, and the anticipated conduct of persons who are anticipated to use, or are using, the areas so designated or under consideration for designation. The village council may reverse or amend the decision of the director as it deems appropriate. Kegs of beer or other alcoholic malt beverages shall be allowed only in reserved picnic areas and only with a permit issued by the department of parks and recreation. 
(d)  Special events. The director of parks and recreation may permit, in writing, the sale, possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages incidental to a special event. Such permission may not exceed four consecutive days. In determining whether the sale, possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages should be permitted, the director of parks and recreation may consider, among other factors, the nature of the event, the anticipated number, age and/or conduct of persons attending the event, the days and/or times of the event, uses of areas near the special event, and the anticipated impact the sale, possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages would have on the park, its uses and the special event. The village council may reverse or amend the decision of the director of parks and recreation as it deems appropriate. 
(e)  Permitted sales. The village council may permit the sale of alcoholic beverages by private entrepreneurs who develop and/or operate facilities upon premises leased from the village within a village park for food service, performing arts, golf courses, and other facilities, as the village council deems appropriate.

The council action shall set forth the type of alcoholic beverages which may be sold, the area in which the sale may occur, the area in which the alcoholic beverage may be possessed and consumed, and the hours and days during which the sale, possession and/or consumption is permitted. The council action may set forth other terms and conditions as the village council deems appropriate. The village council may, at its discretion, revoke or condition such approval, either temporarily or permanently. 
(f)  State licensing; lessee requirements. The village may, at its option, obtain in its name the necessary state licensing for the sale of alcoholic beverages. The lessee for whose benefit the license is held shall be responsible for all costs associated with obtaining and renewing such license. The village may, at its option, have such license transferred to the lessee's name; however, such licensing shall immediately revert to the village upon termination, for any reason, of the lessee's lease with the village. The license holder shall take all action and execute all documents necessary to effect transfer to the village. 
(g)  Permit conditions. The permission granted under this section shall be subject to all ordinances, laws, rules and regulations applicable in the village; and any grantee shall be responsible for compliance thereto. The permission granted may also be subject to and granted with specified conditions, and the grantee shall be responsible for ensuring compliance thereto. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions as to the type of alcoholic beverages sold, possessed and/or consumed; the type or size of containers; crowd size; other activities; areas for sale, possession or consumption; times and/or days; and conduct of individuals bringing alcoholic beverages to the area.

(b)  It is further intended by the village council in adopting this article to provide for the proper location of regulated uses in the village as a permitted use in the nonresidential zoning districts along principal arterial roadways, to require a separation between such uses to avoid clustering, and to require separation from and thereby protect the integrity of incompatible uses in nearby neighborhoods, including residences, educational institutions, religious institutions, public parks and other commercial enterprises. Proper separation of regulated uses prevents the creation of skid row areas in the village which otherwise result from the concentration of these establishments and their patrons. This article has neither the purpose nor the effect of limiting or restricting access by adults to sexually oriented, nonobscene materials protected by the First Amendment, or denying access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. It is instead the intent to limit the secondary effects of regulated uses through content-neutral regulation as set out in this article.

(Ord. No. 96-24, § 7, 9-10-96; Ord. No. 2002-14, § 1, 6-25-02)  
Sec. 10-38. - Findings of fact. 
Based on the evidence and testimony which has been presented to the village council, and based upon the findings incorporated in: (a) the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), (b) "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, City of Indianapolis, January 1984, (c) the "Report on the Secondary Effects of the Concentration of Adult Use Establishments in the Times Square Area," by Insight Associates (April 1994) and "Adult Entertainment Study" by the Department of City Planning, City of New York (November 1994); (d) the "Report to American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses," by Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. of the Environmental Research Group (March 31, 1996); (e) the "Final Report to the City of Garden Grove, CA: The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Blvd.," by Richard McCleary, Ph.D. and James W. Meeker, J.D., Ph.D. (Oct. 23, 1991), and (f) "An Analysis of the Effects of SOB's on the Surrounding Neighborhoods In Dallas, TX as of April 1997," by Peter Malin, MAI, the village council hereby finds that: 
(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the village or in close proximity to the village where books, magazines, motion pictures, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties and/or devices which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed or sold; 
(2)  Such commercial establishments are or may be located within the village or are so close in proximity to the village that the same may seek location within the village where: 
a.  The superficial tissues of one person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified anatomical areas; 
b.  Dancers, entertainers or other individuals who, for any form of commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing any specified anatomical area; or 
c.  Lap dancing occurs. 
(3)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur at commercial establishments for the purpose of commercial gain and, as such, are subject to regulation within and by the village in the interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people of the village; 
(4)  The competitive commercial exploitation of such nudity and seminudity is adverse to the public's interest and the quality of life, ton of commerce, and total community environment in the village; 
(5)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are presented in commercial establishments within the village, other activities which are illegal, immoral or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them; such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property; 
(6)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are present in commercial establishments within the village, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower property values, promote crime (particularly the kinds detailed in subsection (5) of this section) and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations; and 
(7)  There is a direct relationship between the display or depiction of specified anatomical areas in subsections (1) and (2) of this section and an increase in criminal activities, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the concurrency of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the public's interest and quality of life, tone of commerce and total community environment in the village. 
(8)  To preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare of the village and its residents, it is necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict the conduct of owners, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, patrons, spectators, and other persons on the premises of these establishments.

Permit application forms shall be in the format prescribed by a local administrative board, if applicable, and must comply with the requirements of F.S. § 713.135(5) and (6). 
Each application shall be inscribed with the date of application, and the code in effect as of that date. For a building permit for which an application is submitted prior to the effective date of the Florida Building Code, the state minimum building code in effect in the permitting jurisdiction on the date of the application governs the permitted work for the life of the permit and any extension granted to the permit. 
Effective October 1, 2017, a local enforcement agency shall post each type of building permit application on its website. Completed applications must be able to be submitted electronically to the appropriate building department. Accepted methods of electronic submission include, but are not limited to, e-mail submission of applications in portable document format or submission of applications through an electronic fill-in form available on the building department's website or through a third-party submission management software.

105.3.1 Action on application. Except for applications filed without the prerequisite fees, the building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefore. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. When authorized through contractual agreement with a school board, in acting on applications for permits, the building official shall give first priority to any applications for the construction of, or addition or renovation to, any school or educational facility. 
105.3.1.1 If a state university, Florida college or public school district elects to use a local government's code enforcement offices, fees charged by counties and municipalities for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures, and facilities of state universities, state colleges and public school districts shall not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the code. 
105.3.1.2 No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the enforcing agency which issues the permit any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under Chapter 471, Florida Statutes: 
1.  Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $125,000. 
2.  Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. Personnel as authorized by chapter 633 Florida Statutes, may design a fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of not more than 49 heads, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system. 
3.  Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $125,000. This paragraph does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering a structural part of the building or for work on a residential one, two, three or four-family structure. An air-conditioning system may be designed by an installing air-conditioning contractor certified under Chapter 489, Florida Statutes, to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air-conditioning system with a value of $125,000 or less; and when a 15-ton-per system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. 
Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each unit (system) is less than 15 tons. 
Example 2: Consider a small single-story office building which consists of six individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air-conditioning work is $47,000 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. Because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower this is considered to be an 18-ton system. 
NOTE: It was further clarified by the Commission that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $125,000 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost for the total air-conditioning system of the building. 
4.  Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than $5,000. 
5.  Electrical documents. See Florida Statutes, Section 471.003(2)(h). Any electrical or plumbing or air-conditioning and refrigeration system meeting the following thresholds are required to be designed by a Florida Registered Engineer. The system, requires an electrical system with a value of over $125,000; and Requires an aggregate service capacity of over 600 amperes (240 volts) on a residential electrical system or over 800 amperes (240 volts) on a commercial or industrial electrical system; 
NOTE: It was further clarified by the Florida Building Commission that systems exceeding the limiting factor of 240 volts are required to be designed by an Engineer. 
Documents requiring an engineer seal by this part shall not be valid unless a professional engineer who possesses a valid certificate of registration has signed, dated, and stamped such document as provided in Section 471.025, Florida Statutes. 
6.  All public swimming pools and public bathing places defined by and regulated under Chapter 514, Florida Statutes. 
105.3.2 Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned and becoming null and void after six months of no activity, abandonment or failure to respond to requested corrections occurs during the application process after the date of filing unless such application has been pursued in good faith or permit has been issued; except that the building official is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing prior to the abandonment date, with justifiable cause demonstrated. Abandoned applications shall be subject to destruction in accordance with state law. The fee for extension of a permit application shall be set forth by the administrative authority. There may be fees or requirements from other government agencies for permit application extensions. 
105.3.3 An enforcing authority may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county such as the requirement for Home or Property Owners Association approval and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies or federal agencies." 
105.3.4 A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 working days of application therefore unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code or the enforcing agency's laws or ordinances. 
105.3.5 Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, Workers' compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in F.S. § 440.10 and 440.38.

The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm out building on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances.

(3)  For a transfer of a franchise (other than a pro forma transfer): ..... 5,000.00

(5)  For modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545: ..... 1,000.00 
(6)  For any other relief: ..... 500.00 
The purpose of the filing fee is to defray a portion of the village's cost in processing an application. The filing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed in a franchise agreement or credited against any tax, including, but not limited to, the Florida Communications Service Tax (Ch. 202. F.S.) or any substitute tax or fee, unless required by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(08), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-39. - Grant of franchises. 
(a)  The village may grant a cable franchise for a period not to exceed 15 years plus such extensions as may be approved by the village to serve the village. 
(b)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the village may, if applicable, and if required by applicable federal or state law, shall consider, among other things, the following factors: the applicant's technical, financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the adequacy of the proposed construction arrangements, facilities, equipment, and services based on the public convenience, safety and welfare; the applicant's experience in constructing and operating cable systems and providing cable service in other communities. In the case of an initial grant, the village shall also consider the economic impact upon private property within the franchise area; the public need for such franchise, if any; the capacity of public rights-of-way to accommodate the cable system; the present and future use of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable system; the potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable system and the resultant inconvenience which may occur to the public; the financial ability of the franchise applicant to perform; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Evaluation by the village shall not be based on the content of the programming the applicant proposes to provide. 
(c)  The village shall hold a public hearing to consider an application or applications, the applicant(s) shall be given at least ten days' prior notice of the hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application(s), the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the village manager or staff, and any other information relevant to the application(s), the village shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny a franchise application. 
(d)  As a condition precedent to the grant of a franchise, the applicant shall file an acceptance of the franchise accompanied by any and all bonds, certificates of insurance or other obligations as required in a franchise agreement no later than the date of the village council's consideration of the grant or denial of the application. This period may be extended for good cause by the village. If the acceptance is not filed with the village by the above-referenced date, or if the period is not extended by the village, the council may delay consideration of the application or deny the application. The village may, at its option, grant the applicant a short-term extension(s). The grant of such a short term extension(s) will not confer on the applicant the right to an automatic acceptance, transfer, modification or renewal. In the case of a transfer, the village shall grant an extension to this requirement as long as the franchisee keeps such insurance, bonds or other surety in place until 30 days after the transaction related to the transfer closes and the transferee has provided its insurance, bonds or other surety in place within 30 days following such closing. 
(e)  Unless prohibited by applicable law, applications for the grant of an initial franchise, a franchise renewal, a franchise agreement modification, or a franchise transfer may be subject to a processing fee in addition to the filing fee in an amount not to exceed the reasonable and justifiable out-of-pocket costs to the extent that the filing fee does not cover the costs incurred by the village in considering the application, including consulting and legal costs. Prior to the date of the resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or modification or transfer thereof by the village council, the village shall notify the franchisee of the estimated amount of any processing fee and its method of calculation. 
This processing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed in a franchise agreement or any federal or state tax and shall not be passed through to subscribers as a separate line item unless required by applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(09), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-40. - Commencement of service. 
Any franchisee commencing initial construction of a cable television system after the effective date of this chapter shall commence construction within one year of the effective date of the franchise agreement and shall complete construction so as to offer service to all dwellings within the franchise area in compliance with the requirements of a franchise agreement, but in no event later than two years from the effective date of the franchise agreement unless an extension is granted by the village for good cause shown. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(10), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-41. - Insurance; surety; indemnification. 
(a)  A franchisee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the franchise specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire term of the franchise including any renewals thereof, the following liability insurance coverage insuring the village to the extent applicable and the franchisee: worker's compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all requirements of Florida law and commercial general liability insurance with contractual coverage with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of the cable system, and the conduct of franchisee's business in the village, in the minimum amounts of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence, for bodily injury or death, broad form property damage liability, and insurance to cover infringement of copyrights. 
(b)  All insurance policies shall be with insurance companies authorized to do business in the State of Florida and such companies shall have a minimum Best's Rating of A-1, or an equivalent rating. The village may require coverage and amounts in excess of the above minimums where necessary to reflect changing liability exposure and limits or where required by law. 
(c)  A franchisee shall keep on file with the village certificates of insurance evidencing the above insurance coverage and evidencing that the village, its officers, boards, council, agents and employees are listed as additional insureds on the general liability policy. If a claim is filed such that the village claims insurance coverage, franchisee shall immediately respond to all reasonable requests by the village for information with respect to the scope of the insurance coverage. 
(d)  All general liability insurance policies shall provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless 30 days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the village. A franchisee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of proof that the franchisee has obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the village which complies with this chapter. 
(e)  A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the village, its officials, boards, councils, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs and expenses arising out of the willful or negligent acts or omissions of the franchisee or its officers, agents, employees or contractors relating to construction, maintenance or operation of its cable system, and the conduct of franchisee's business in the village; provided, however, that franchisee's obligation hereunder shall not extend to any claims caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of the village, its officials, boards, agents or employees, or to claims arising from franchisee's provision of access channels for public, educational and/or governmental use pursuant to a franchise granted hereunder, to the extent such claims relate to programming and content on such channels, over which franchisee has no editorial control nor exercises administrative control. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the village's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings, and claims arising out of copyright infringement or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or providers of programs to be delivered by the cable system, claims arising out of Section 638 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 558, and claims against the franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm or corporation. If any such claim arises, the franchisee shall have the obligation and duty to defend the village and any other indemnified party hereunder; provided, however, franchisee may not agree to any settlement of claims affecting the village without the village attorney's approval. If the village attorney finds that separate representation to fully protect the interests of the village is necessary, franchisee shall consult with the village attorney on counsel that is acceptable to the village attorney. If franchisee is unwilling or unable to select counsel acceptable to the village attorney, whose acceptance shall only be withheld for good cause shown, franchisee shall pay all actual and reasonable expenses incurred by the village in defending itself with regard to any action, suit or proceeding subject to this indemnification. The village's expenses shall include all out of pocket expenses, attorney's fees and costs of the village attorney or assistants, or any village employees, outside attorneys or other agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, franchisee shall not be required to indemnify the village pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement for actions relating to public, government and education access programming decisions outside of franchisee's control or for the village's use of the cable system or the use of public, government and education access channels, facilities or funding.

Bonds shall be executed and issued by a resident agent, licensed and having an office in Palm Beach, Dade, Broward or Martin Counties, Florida, representing such corporate sureties. If the franchisee is a partnership, the bond should be signed by each of the individuals who are partners; if a corporation, the bond should be signed in the correct corporate name by duly authorized officer, agent or attorney-in-fact. There should be executed an appropriate number of counterparts of the bond corresponding to the number of counterparts in the franchise. 
(d)  If the surety on any bond furnished by franchisee is declared bankrupt or becomes insolvent or its right to do business is terminated in the State of Florida or it ceases to meet the requirements of subsection (b), franchisee shall within ten days thereafter substitute another bond, surety or cash deposit which must be in conformance with subsection (c). 
(e)  The security fund shall be maintained at the amount specified in a franchise agreement, even if amounts have to be withdrawn and replenished pursuant to subsection (g). 
(f)  Following a determination by the village pursuant to section 22-55 that the franchisee has failed to comply with any provision of the franchise agreement which the village reasonably determines can be remedied by demand on the security fund, the village may immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the village shall notify the franchisee of the amount and the date thereof. 
(g)  Within 30 days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund deposited pursuant to subsection (a) above, the franchisee shall pay to, or deposit with, the village a sum sufficient to restore such security fund to the amounts specified in subsection (a), whatever the case may be. Failure to replenish the security fund shall subject the franchisee to penalties. However, replenishment is without prejudice to the franchisee's right under section 22-55 to contest the validity of the village's withdrawal of money from the security fund. 
(h)  The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund posted pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the village may have under this chapter, the franchise agreement, or at law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right or remedy of the village. 
(i)  The portion of the security fund deposited pursuant to this section necessary to compensate the village for damages and costs sustained shall become the property of the village in the event that the franchise is canceled or terminated by reason of the default of the franchisee. The franchisee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof less any amount in dispute, without interest, as remains on deposit with the village six months after the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the franchisee.

(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(16), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-47. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  As of the effective date hereof, the State of Florida Communications Service Tax, (F.S., Ch. 202), prohibits the obligations imposed on a Franchisee in this section and this section 22-47 is severable from this chapter and has no effect on the remaining valid portions of this chapter. However, if state or federal law allows the village to impose the requirements of this section, the village expressly reserves the right to do so. 
(b)  If permitted by applicable law, a franchisee, as compensation for the privilege granted under a franchise pursuant to this chapter for the use of the village's streets to construct and operate a cable system, shall pay to the village a franchise fee in an amount up to a maximum of either (i) five percent of the franchisee's gross revenues derived from the operation of its cable system within the village during the term of its franchise; or (ii) in the event the Communications Act or other applicable law is amended to permit the village to assess a franchise fee of a greater amount than that specified in (i) above, the franchisee agrees to pay to the village the new amount after a public hearing in which the public and franchisee are given an opportunity to comment on the impact of the higher fee. In no event shall a franchisee pay a franchise fee greater than the maximum permitted by applicable law. 
(c)  A franchisee shall pay the franchise fee due to the village on a quarterly basis. Payment for each month shall be made to the village not later than 45 calendar days after the end of each calendar month. 
(d)  A franchisee shall file with the village within 60 days after the expiration of each calendar year or portion thereof during which its franchise is in force, a financial statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year or portion thereof and a detailed explanation of the method of computation. The statement shall be certified by a duly authorized corporate officer. The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
(e)  Subject to applicable law, any acceptance by the village of any franchise fee payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the village may have for additional sums payable. 
(f)  The franchise fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any other tax, fee or assessment, subject to applicable law. 
(g)  If permitted by applicable law, the village, or its representative, may from time to time but not more than once in any 12-month period, and upon reasonable notice, inspect, audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and may re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. In the case of any franchise granted, renewed, modified or transferred on or after the effective date hereof the cost of the audit will be borne by the franchisee if, as a result of the audit, the village determines that the franchisee has underpaid the franchise fees owned in an amount equal to or exceeding two percent of the franchise fees actually paid. A franchisee shall make all books and records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available to the auditors in Palm Beach County for inspection and copying. 
(h)  In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by the village on or before the due date set forth in subsection (c) above, any franchisee granted an initial franchise, renewal, modification or transfer on or after the date hereof shall pay a late charge of 18 percent per annum of the amount of the unpaid franchise fee payment; provided, however, that such rate does not exceed the maximum amount allowed under Florida law. Any interest and/or late charges paid by franchisee is intended to be a charge incidental to the enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622 (g)(2)(D) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed by this chapter or any franchise agreement. 
(i)  Unless prohibited by law, when a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the franchisee shall file with the village within 90 calendar days of the date it ceases operations in the village, a financial statement, audited by an independent certified public accountant and certified by the franchisee's chief or other duly authorized financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments will be made at that time for franchise fees due to the date that the franchisee's operations ceased.

The financial report shall include notes to the financial statements that specify all significant accounting policies and practices upon which it is based. As of the date of this chapter, the obligations imposed on franchisee in this section to provide an annual financial statement are prohibited by the State of Florida Simplified Communications Service Tax, F.S., Ch. 202, and this obligation is severable from this chapter and has no effect on the remaining valid provisions hereof. However, if state or federal law allows the village to impose the requirements of this section, the village expressly reserves the right to do so.

(4)  Any and all notices of deficiency, forfeiture or documents instituting any investigation, civil or criminal proceeding issued by any state or federal agency regarding the cable system, franchisee or any affiliate of franchisee, provided, however, that any such notice or documents relating to an affiliate of the franchisee need be provided only to the extent the same may directly and adversely affect or bear on operations of the franchisee in the village. For example, a notice that an affiliate that has a management contract for the cable system located in the village was not in compliance with the FCC's EEO requirements would be deemed to affect or bear on operations in the village. 
(d)  The franchisee shall, upon written request, furnish to the village such additional reports as a franchisee may prepare as a customary business practice with respect to its operations of the cable system, which in the village's discretion are reasonable and necessary for the administration and/or enforcement of this chapter. 
(e)  A franchisee shall provide the village, within 30 days of filing or receipt of any petition or filings with any federal, state, or local agencies or courts, which may, in the reasonable judgment of the franchisee, adversely impact the construction, operation or maintenance of franchisee's cable system, affect village and/or subscribers regarding this chapter or a franchise agreement, including, but not limited to, any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy.

(f)  A franchisee shall make a complete set of books and records available for inspection and audit by the village in Palm Beach County, for purposes of ascertaining compliance with this chapter and the franchise agreement, subject to subsection (g) below.

The village shall accord all books and records that it inspects under this section the degree of confidentiality such books and records are entitled to under federal and state law. A franchisee's books and records shall not constitute public records, except to the extent required by federal and state law. To the extent a franchisee considers any books or records that it is required to produce to be confidential or otherwise protected from public disclosure, franchisee shall designate which documents it views as protected and provide a written explanation to the village of the legal basis for franchisee's claim of protection.

(g)  Disconnection. 
(1)  Voluntary disconnection. 
a.  A Subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
b.  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests from the franchisee's cable system. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. So long as the subscriber returns equipment to franchisee's service center located in the village or makes available to franchisee to pick up within three business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any franchisee for such voluntary disconnection or for any cable services delivered after the date of disconnection request. 
c.  A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect the franchisee's equipment. 
d.  Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after the converter has been recovered by the franchisee.

(2)  Involuntary disconnection. If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until 45 days after the date on which the applicable monthly bill was sent to the subscriber and advance written notice of intent to disconnect to the subscriber in question. The notice of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement provided that the message is in bold or large type or other similar manner designed to bring the information to the subscriber's attention. If the subscriber pays within 45 days after the date on which the applicable monthly bill was sent and after notice of disconnection has been given, the franchisee shall not disconnect. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate cable service. Franchisee reserves the right to deny cable service to any subscriber who has been repeatedly disconnected for nonpayment of such services to the extent such rights are consistent with applicable state and federal law. 
(3)  With respect to any disconnection, whether requested or involuntary, a franchisee shall comply with the rules and regulations of the FCC and applicable law regarding ownership, sale, removal and abandonment of home wiring.

(k)  A franchisee shall develop written procedures for the investigation and resolution of all subscriber or village resident complaints that are received by the village. Such procedures shall be submitted to the village manager or designee. A subscriber or village resident who has not been satisfied by following the franchisee's procedures may file a written complaint with the village manager or designee who will investigate the matter and in consultation with the franchisee, as appropriate, attempt to resolve the matter. A franchisee's performance in resolving subscriber and resident complaints in a fair and equitable manner will be considered in connection with the franchisee's renewal application. Franchisee shall maintain a complete list of all complaints received during the previous 12 months from subscribers that required a service call and were not resolved within seven days of receipt and the measures taken to resolve them. This list shall be compiled on a quarterly basis and, if such unresolved complaints exist, submitted to the village upon request. In providing such information, franchisee shall be obligated to protect subscriber privacy in accordance with federal law. 
(l)  Franchisee shall permit the village manager or designee to inspect and test the cable system's technical equipment and facilities upon reasonable notice which shall be not less than 72 hours except in the case of an emergency, as determined by the village manager or designee. 
(m)  Franchisee shall abide by the following requirements governing communications with subscribers, bills and refunds: 
(1)  Each franchisee shall provide to subscribers written information in each of the following areas at the time of installation, or at least once annually, and at any future time upon request by the subscriber:

(2)  In addition, each franchisee shall provide written notice in its monthly billing, at the request of the village manager, of any village meeting regarding requests or applications by the franchisee for renewal, transfer or modification of its license. The village manager shall make such a request in writing, with reasonable notice prior to the mailing of any billing by franchisee, such that franchisee's regular billing cycle shall not be interrupted. To the extent that any notice requested by the village would exceed the messaging limitations of the franchisee's billing system and would thus cause the franchisee to print and insert a separate document into the bill, the village may be requested to pay printing costs and incremental postage expenses for such notice. 
(3)  Franchisee's bills will be clear, concise and understandable. 
(4)  Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than the earlier of 45 days or the subscriber's next billing cycle following the resolution of a refund request, or the return of the equipment supplied by the franchisee if cable service is terminated. 
(5)  Credits for service will be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(6)  A franchisee shall provide subscribers, the village manager, and the village council with at least 30 days' advance written notice of any changes in rates, charges, channel lineup, or initiations or discontinuations or changes of cable services offered over the cable system if such change is within the control of the franchisee, and in accordance with FCC regulations. 
(n)  A franchisee shall, upon an affected subscriber's request, provide a pro-rated 24-hour credit to the subscriber's account for any period of four hours or more within a 24-hour period during which a subscriber experienced an outage of service or substantial impairment of service, whether due to a cable system malfunction or other cause. 
(o)  Billing. 
(1)  The franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be pro-rated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(2)  The franchisee's billing statement must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
(3)  The franchisee's billing statement must show a specific payment due date. Any balance not received by the due date may be assessed a late charge consistent with applicable law. The late charge will appear on the following month's billing statement. 
a.  Franchisee shall provide reasonable notice to the village and subscribers of the amount of any processing fees for late payments and the manner of imposing such fees. Any late fee that may be imposed shall be in an amount and manner consistent with applicable state and federal law. Late charges on unpaid bills shall not exceed $5.00. Such fee shall be deemed to represent the franchisee's reasonable administrative costs, and in no event shall exceed 18 percent per annum on the unpaid balance or the maximum amount of interest allowed by law. If a subscriber disputes a bill on or before the due date, the franchisee shall waive a late fee during the period until a final resolution of the dispute is agreed upon between the franchisee and the subscriber. 
b.  Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(4)  The franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit payment in person at the franchisee's office in the village and inform the subscriber of the address of that office. 
(p)  Alteration of service. Except as incident to an upgrade or rebuild of the cable system, a franchisee may not substantially alter the cable service being provided to a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier or otherwise) without the express affirmative permission of such subscriber, unless it complies with this subsection. 
(1)  If a franchisee wishes to alter the cable service being provided to a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier or otherwise) in such a way that the subscriber will no longer be able to obtain the same package of cable services then the franchisee must provide the subscriber with 30 days' notice of such alteration, explain the substance and the full effect of the alteration, and provide the subscriber the right within the 30-day period following notice, to opt to receive any combination of cable services offered by the franchisee. 
(2)  Except as provided herein or under applicable federal, state or local law, no charge may be made for any cable service or product which the subscriber has not affirmatively indicated, in a manner separate and apart from payment of the regular monthly bill that the subscriber wishes to receive. 
(q)  Franchisee shall certify in writing to the village as of January 1 and July 1 of each year, based upon internal due diligence by the franchisee, that to the best of franchisee's knowledge it is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in this section 22-49, said certification to be made as of a date within 30 days of January 1 and July 1. At the request of the village, for reasonable cause including but not limited to discrepancies between the reports provided to the village and the certification required herein, the franchisee shall submit such documentation, as may be required, to demonstrate franchisee's compliance with this section 22-49. This documentation shall be submitted within 30 days of the franchisee's receipt of the village's request. 
(r)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, franchisee shall not incorporate within any bulk residential subscriber contract the term of the franchise granted by the village as the length of the term of a bulk contract(s) franchisee shall make available to all residential bulk subscribers the same level of service provided to franchisee's residential subscribers in the village, including, but not limited to, the requirements of section 22-49 herein, unless the parties to the bulk contract have expressly agreed otherwise in writing. 
(s)  Responsibility for the administration of this chapter and any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, and for the resolution of all complaints against the franchisee regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and related matters, is hereby delegated to the village manager or his designee, who is empowered, among other things, to settle, or compromise any controversy arising from operations of the cable system by franchisee, either on behalf of the village or any subscriber, in accordance with the best interests of the public. In cases where requests for service have been ignored or in cases where the service provided is alleged to be in noncompliance with this chapter or a franchise agreement, the village manager or his designee shall have the power to require the franchisee to provide service consistent with the terms of the franchise, if in the opinion of the village manager or his designee such request for service is reasonable. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the village manager, including the franchisee, may appeal the matter to the village council for hearing and determination. The village council may accept, reject or modify the decision of the village manager.

(1)  Prior to assessing a fine, the village manager or designee shall consider any justification or mitigating factor advanced in franchisee's written response, including, but not limited to rebates or credits to the subscriber, a cure or commencement of a cure of the violation, and the payment of any penalty to Palm Beach County for the same violation. The village manager or designee may, after consideration of the response of the franchisee, waive or reduce any proposed fine. 
(2)  Subsequent to the notice of proposed fine to franchisee and consideration of the franchisee's response, if any, and after following the procedures set forth in section 22-55 hereof, the village may issue an assessment of fine. Any fine will commence as of the date of the written notice specifying the violation at issue. The fine shall be paid within 30 days of written notice of assessment to the franchisee. The village may enforce payment of the refund or fine in any court having jurisdiction or if franchisee challenges the assessment in a court of competent jurisdiction, within 30 days of a final nonappealable decision that the assessment is valid. This fine shall constitute liquidated damages to the village for the violation and the village may enforce payment of the fine in any court having jurisdiction. It is the intent of the village to determine fines as a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by the village and/or its subscribers, whether actual or potential, and may include without limitation, increased costs of administration, enforcement and other damages difficult to measure. 
(3)  Any person who intentionally files a false complaint against a franchisee shall be subject to a fine, payable to the village, in the amount of $50.00 for the first violation and $100.00 for each subsequent violation. 
(4)  Intentional misrepresentation by a franchisee in any response to a notice of proposed refund and/or fine shall be grounds for revocation of the franchise. 
(5)  In addition to complying with the customer service standards set forth in this chapter or in any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter, a franchisee shall comply with all customer service standards applicable to cable systems of the FCC and any other applicable law governing the operations of the cable system within the village. If during the term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, the FCC modifies the customer service standards applicable to franchisee, the village may modify this chapter to reflect any such new customer service standards. 
(u)  The village expressly reserves the right to consider violations of the customer service requirements in evaluating any renewal, modification or transfers of any franchise agreement. 
(v)  The village and franchisee recognize that the customer service standards set forth in this section 22-49 reflect the current operating procedures of franchisee. If franchisee's current operating procedures change during the term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, the village agrees to meet with franchisee to discuss appropriate modifications to such standards and to consider such reasonable modifications to the standards set forth herein as requested by a franchisee to reflect any such new operating procedures. Upon request of the franchisee, the village shall also discuss with franchisee the need to continue such regulation in light of the competition that franchisee may face in the provision of cable services to subscribers and to consider such reasonable modifications to the customer service standards set forth herein light of the competitive environment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, franchisee shall be obligated to comply with this section 22-49 unless modifications are agreed upon by the village and franchisee in writing.

(a)  No franchisee in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its cable system, or in any other respect, may unlawfully discriminate against any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer promotional or discount rates to certain, but not all, subscribers for a limited time without violating the provisions of this section 22-51. A franchisee shall not deny, delay, or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political affiliation, except for discounts for senior citizens, the economically disadvantaged or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee may also offer bulk discounts to multiple dwelling buildings to the extent such discounts are otherwise permissible by law. 
(b)  A franchisee shall not deny cable service to any potential subscriber because of the income of the residents of the area in which the subscriber resides. 
(c)  The franchisee shall comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(21), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-52. - Use of streets. 
(a)  Any pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved area taken up or any excavations made by a franchisee shall be done under the direction of the village under permits issued for work by the environmental and engineering services department of the village, and shall be done in such manner as to give the least inconvenience to the inhabitants of the village. A franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the village, replace and restore any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved areas in as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done, and shall also make and keep full and complete plats, maps and records showing the exact locations of its facilities located within the public streets, ways, and easements of the village. 
(b)  Except to the extent required by law, a franchisee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove, any of its property when required by the village by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or widening, change of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal or public utility improvements; provided, however, that the franchisee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place. 
(c)  A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the case where the requesting person is the village, in which case no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not less than five calendar days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(d)  A franchisee shall have the authority to trim the trees or other natural growth upon and overhanging the streets so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires, cables and other equipment of the franchisee, except that, at the option of the village, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the franchisee.

(g)  All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents of the village of their use of any street or any other public rights-of-way. 
(h)  A franchisee shall, at all times: 
(1)  Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the village's building code and electrical safety ordinances and any other applicable building or electrical safety code, and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of the village. 
(2)  Keep and maintain in a safe, suitable, substantial condition, and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment, and connections in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways or places of the village, wherever situated or located. 
(i)  On streets where both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and a subscriber's residence, a franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. If either electric or telephone utility wiring is aerial, a franchisee may install aerial cable except where a property owner or resident requests underground installation and agrees to bear the additional cost of such installation over and above the cost of aerial installation. 
(j)  In the event the use of any part of a cable system is discontinued for any reason so as to result in franchisee's failure to provide service to any portion of its franchise area for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street without complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or expired, the franchisee, within 30 days after written notice by the village, shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the village may require. 
(k)  The village may extend the time for the removal of franchisee's equipment and facilities for a period not to exceed 180 days, and, thereafter, such equipment and facilities may be deemed abandoned. 
(l)  In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee shall restore the area to as good a condition as prior to such removal or abandonment. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(22), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-53. - Renewal of franchise. 
Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C., § 546. The following additional requirements, unless in conflict with applicable law, shall apply: 
(a)  Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, should that process be invoked, the village shall notify the franchisee by certified or registered mail that it may file a formal renewal application in the form of a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days following the date of the notice. 
(1)  The application shall comply with the requirements of section 22-38 hereof, to the extent applicable to franchise renewals and provide the specific information requested in the notice or such other information as is reasonably designated by the village in the notice requesting a formal renewal proposal. If the franchisee does not submit a formal renewal application by the date specified in the village's notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this subsection, which shall in no event be less than 120 days, the village may take such action as appropriate under law. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the formal renewal application, the village shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The village, following prior public notice of no less than ten days, may hold one or more public hearings on the renewal application. 
(b)  After the public hearing(s) on the renewal application is held, the village council may either award a franchise pursuant to a request for proposal, and thereby renew the franchise; or only after a public hearing, properly noticed, pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that sets forth the grounds that the franchise should not be renewed. 
(c)  If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the village will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C., § 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C., § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D). Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with 47 U.S.C. § 546(b) shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D), pursuant to the record of proceedings under 47 U.S.C. § 546(c). The village shall not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under Section 546(c)(1)(A) or on events considered under Section 546(c)(1)(B) unless the village has provided the franchisee with notice and opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the village has waived its right to object, or the franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the village fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(d)  Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C., § 546(a), or submitted within such time frame and the parties agree that the informal process shall be first initiated, shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C., § 546(h). The village may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the village council shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. If the village council grants a renewal application, the village and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified herein, before such renewal becomes effective. 
(e)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied, the village may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person upon approval of the village council pursuant to Section 547 of the Communications Act. The village may not acquire ownership of the system or effect a transfer of ownership of the cable system while an appeal of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(e). 
(f)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied and the village does not purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system to another person, and no appeal to a court is pending, the village may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the village may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(23), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-54. - Transfers. 
(a)  No transfer, sale or assignment of any interest in a franchise shall occur without prior village approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(b)  An application for a transfer, sale or assignment of any interest of a franchise shall meet the requirements of section 22-38 hereof, and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including, but not limited to, details on the legal, financial, technical and other material and lawful qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. Except in the case of a pro forma transfer as defined herein, the application shall provide, at a minimum, the information required in section 22-38 or such other information as is specified in a franchise agreement in lieu of the information required in section 22-38. Upon written request, the applicant shall provide to the village as additional information any and all written information, other than the information required to be provided by this chapter and the franchise agreement, that has been provided to Palm Beach County in connection with the transfer if such information is relevant to the village. The village hereby reserves the right to request such additional information as it may reasonably require to consider the application, however, such requests shall not have the effect of tolling the 120-day automatic approval period provided by federal law. However, nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of the village's right to deny approval of a transfer within the 120-day period. 
(c)  The application process shall not include any pro forma transfers, as defined herein, that are related solely to any restructuring, recapitalization or refinancing which does not change the effective control of the franchisee or to any mortgages and pledges of franchisee's securities, but shall require proper notice to the village pursuant to the terms of the ordinance or the franchise agreement. 
(d)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the village council shall consider the legal, financial, technical and other lawful and material qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in substantial compliance with the material terms of its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed commitment of the transferee to cure such noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers. The village council shall not unreasonably withhold approval to any such transfer. However, nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of the village's right to deny approval of a transfer within the 120-day period. 
(e)  No franchise transfer application shall be granted unless the transferee, if the franchise holder, agrees in writing to abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and a franchise agreement, and to assume all obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee, whether known or unknown. If such transferee will not be the holder of the franchise, such transferee will sign an acknowledgement ensuring compliance by the franchisee with the franchise agreement and this chapter. The village shall certify to franchisee, upon request, all issues of franchisee's performance that are known and pending. 
(f)  Subject to applicable law, approval by the village of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the village under this chapter or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(g)  Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 22-55, failure to obtain the consent of the village with respect to this section 22-54 may result in the imposition of liquidated damages in the amount of $1,500.00 per day for failure to receive such consent of the village for a transfer or change of control; provided, however, that no such liquidated damages shall be owed if the village's denial of consent is unlawful or unreasonable. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(24), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-55. - Franchise violations. 
(a)  In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the village may apply any one or combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates a provision of this chapter or a franchise agreement after following the procedures set forth in subsections (d)(h) below. 
(1)  Impose liquidated damages in an amount of not less than $250.00 per day or part thereof per individual violation, or as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter or in a franchise agreement. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement and the requirements of this chapter, provided, however, that cure of the alleged violation and payment of liquidated damages pursuant to this section shall be considered full and final resolution of the alleged violation and may not be considered as an event of noncompliance for such period. 
(2)  Revoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in section 22-56 hereof. 
(3)  In addition to or instead of any other remedy provided herein, the village may seek equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the village shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person or persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations and such other matters as the village determines are appropriate to the public interest. 
(c)  Failure of the village to enforce any requirements of a franchise agreement or this chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the village's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
(d)  If the village (or the village manager or designee with respect to section 22-49 of this chapter) believes that franchisee has failed to perform any obligation under this chapter or a franchise agreement or has failed to perform in a timely manner, the village shall notify franchisee in writing, stating with reasonable specific village the nature of the alleged default. Franchisee shall have 30 days from the receipt of such notice to: 
(1)  Respond to the village, contesting the village's assertion that a default has occurred, and requesting a meeting in accordance with subsection (e), below; or 
(2)  Cure the default (except franchisee shall have 90 days with respect to customer service standards measured on a quarterly basis); or 
(3)  Notify the village that franchisee cannot cure the default within the 30 days (or 90 days where applicable), because of the nature of the default. In the event the default cannot be cured within the applicable time frame, franchisee shall promptly take all reasonable steps to cure the default and notify the village in writing and in detail as to the exact steps that will be taken and the projected completion date. In such case, the village shall set a meeting in accordance with subsection (e) below to determine whether additional time beyond the time specified above is indeed needed, and whether franchisee's proposed completion schedule and steps are reasonable. 
(e)  If franchisee does not cure the alleged default within the cure period stated above, or by the projected completion date under subsection (d)(3), or denies the default and requests a meeting in accordance with subsection (d)(1), or the village orders a meeting in accordance with subsection (d)(3), the village shall set a meeting to investigate said issues or the existence of the alleged default. The village shall notify franchisee of the meeting in writing and such meeting shall take place no less than 30 days after franchisee's receipt of notice of the meeting. At the meeting, franchisee shall be provided an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence in its defense. 
(f)  If, after the meeting, the village determines that the franchisee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the village and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(g)  If, after the meeting, the village determine that a violation exists and that franchisee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently process to correct the violation, the village may: 
(1)  Impose penalties and/or liquidated damages in accordance with subsection (a) above and withdraw such amount from the security fund required in this chapter or a franchise agreement as monetary damages; 
(2)  Recommend the revocation of this franchise pursuant to the procedures in section 22-56 below; or 
(3)  Recommend any other legal or equitable remedy available under this franchise or any applicable law. 
(h)  If the village (or the village manager or designee in the case of fines assessed in accordance with section 22-49 of this chapter) elects to assess liquidated damages in accordance with this section 22-55, then such election shall bar the village from instituting revocation proceedings for a period of 120 days. Thereafter, if the franchisee remains in noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, the village may institute revocation proceedings against the franchisee in accordance with the provisions of section 22-56 below. 
(1)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any fines/liquidated damages imposed herein shall be calculated as accruing from the date of written notice to the franchisee of the violation. 
(2)  The determination as to whether a violation of this franchise has occurred shall be within the discretion of the village council, provided that any final determination may be subject to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(25), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-56. - Revocation. 
(a)  The village may revoke and rescind all rights and privileges associated with a franchise in the following circumstances, each of which represents a material breach of this franchise: 
(1)  If franchisee fails to perform any material obligation under this chapter or in a franchise agreement between under the village and franchisee; 
(2)  If franchisee willfully fails for more than 48 hours to provide continuous and uninterrupted cable service; 
(3)  If franchisee practices any fraud or deceit upon the village or subscribers; or 
(4)  If franchisee willfully makes a material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of a franchise, a renewal or a transfer. 
(b)  Prior to forfeiture or termination of the franchise, the village shall give written notice by certified mail to the franchisee of its intent to revoke the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. If within 30 days following receipt of such written notice from the village to the franchisee, the franchisee has not cured such violation or breach, or has not entered into a written agreement with the village on a program to cure the violation, or has not demonstrated that the violation is incurable, or has filed a written response to the village demonstrating that no violation has occurred, the village may then seek a termination of the franchise by the village council in accordance with this subsection. 
(c)  Any proceeding under the subsection above shall be conducted by the village council and open to the public. Franchisee shall be afforded at least 30 days' prior written notice of such proceeding. 
(1)  At such proceeding, franchisee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce evidence, and to question witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such proceeding and the cost shall be shared equally between the parties. The village council shall hear any persons interested in the revocation, and shall allow franchisee an opportunity to state its position on the matter. 
(2)  Within 90 days after the hearing, the village council shall determine whether to revoke the franchise and declare that the franchise is revoked and the security fund forfeited; or if the breach at issue is capable of being cured by franchisee, direct franchisee to take appropriate remedial action within the time and in the manner and on the terms and conditions that the village council determines are reasonable under the circumstances. If the village determines that the franchise is to be revoked, the village shall set forth the reasons for such a decision and shall transmit a copy of the decision to the franchisee. Franchisee shall be bound by the village's decision to revoke the franchise unless it appeals the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction within 120 days of the date of the decision. 
(3)  Franchisee shall be entitled to such relief as the court may deem appropriate. 
(4)  The village council may at its sole discretion take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the village's rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise. 
(d)  If the village revokes a franchise, or if, for any other reason, a franchisee abandons the cable system, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers for a period of 30 days, the following procedures and rights are effective: 
(1)  The village may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the village may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
(2)  The village, by resolution of the village council, may acquire ownership, or effect a transfer of the cable system, in accordance with Section 627 of the Communications Act. 
(3)  If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the village may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system. 
(e)  Where the village has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such other specific obligations as required may result in revocation of the franchise, unless the village, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time. 
(f)  No adverse action against a franchisee may be taken by the village pursuant to this section except as consistent with the procedures set forth in this section or as otherwise provided by applicable law, including a noticed public hearing at which the franchisee is given an opportunity to participate. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10, § 1(26), 4-11-06)  
Sec. 22-57. - Continuity of service mandatory. 
(a)  It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied. 
(b)  In the event of a termination or transfer of a franchise for whatever reason, the franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The franchisee shall cooperate with the village to operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six months without the franchisee's written consent.

A communications services provider may satisfy the insurance requirements of this chapter by providing documentation of self-insurance that, in the sole discretion of the village manager, demonstrates incontrovertibly the adequacy to defend and cover claims of any nature that might arise from the placement and maintenance of facilities in the public ROW. The communications services provider must be authorized as a self-insurer by the department of insurance under the laws of the State of Florida. 
(Ord. No. 2018-10, § 6, 4-23-19)  
Sec. 23-7. - General standards for wireless communications facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(a)  Generally. Consistent with F.S. § 337.401, as may be amended, only small wireless facilities and micro wireless facilities may be considered for placement within the village's rights-of-way, and same shall be limited to the size parameters listed therein and any other design specifications detailed in this subdivision. Due to the unique nature of wireless signals and the specific equipment needed for transmission and reception of wireless signals, placement of wireless communications facilities in the public right-of-way shall comply with the following: 
(1)  Collocation or use of concealed facilities. A small or non-exempt micro wireless facility and any antennas in the public right-of-way shall, to the extent possible, be collocated on an existing power, light or other utility pole as illustrated in the examples in subsection (d)(5)vi. below. When collocation of an antenna or small wireless facility or non-exempt micro wireless facility is not possible, a freestanding new concealed facility is preferred, as illustrated in the examples in subsection (d)(5)vi. below. The applicant shall submit a permit application to the village engineer for approval prior to any installation which shall be processed in accordance with this Section and F.S. § 337.401(7). The village prefers that small wireless facilities and non-exempt micro wireless facilities located in the public right-of-way, whether collocated or freestanding, be technically capable of servicing a minimum of four wireless service providers with like technical facilities through the use of neutral host antenna. 
(2)  When collocation occurs upon village utility poles within the village's rights-of-way, in addition to the permit, the village shall require the communications service provider and/or owner, if different parties, to execute a lease agreement and remit an annual rent of $150.00 per village utility pole as provided for herein below. 
(3)  Height, setbacks and related location requirements. 
i.  The height limitation of a small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facility is ten feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facility is to be collocated. Unless waived by the village, the height for a new utility pole is limited to the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1, 2017, located in the same right-of-way, other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within 500 feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within 500 feet, the village shall limit the height of the new utility pole to 50 feet. 
ii.  Except as otherwise provided herein, small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the standards and requirements set forth in the State of Florida Department of Transportation Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. 
iii.  No antenna attached to a freestanding pole in the public rights-of-way with a ground mounted equipment, other than as a collocation with an existing power, light or other utility pole, or unless installed as a concealed facility, shall be permitted within 50 feet of any principal residential structure. 
iv.  An external box or cabinet housing the equipment connected to an antenna attached to a freestanding pole in the public rights-of-way shall be vaulted underground or, if located aboveground, wrapped with a design that screens it from view consistent with the requirements of this subdivision, or complies with the village public art program as set forth in chapter 54. 
v.  When collocation is not available, the village prefers the following locations for new small wireless facilities or non-exempt micro wireless facilities within a right-of-way: from most preferred to least preferred: 
1.  Within existing utility easements in the public right-of-way on the same side of the street as an existing pole line; 
2.  Within the public right-of-way behind sidewalks on the same side of the street as an existing pole line; 
3.  Within existing utility easements in the public right-of-way; 
4.  Behind sidewalks; 
5.  On the same side of the street as an existing pole line. 
Applicants should avoid proposing new small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facilities in the following locations: 
1.  Within or adjacent to residential property where no pole line exists; 
2.  In swale areas utilized for stormwater collection; 
3.  Closer to the travel way than permitted by Florida Department of Transportation minimum roadside offset standards. 
vi.  Small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless communications facilities shall be located in state or county arterial or collector rights-of-way, whenever possible. Placement of small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facilities in a village collector street, cul-de-sac, local street and marginal access street rights-of-way shall be discouraged unless the applicant cannot otherwise provide service to a particular customer or customers without doing so, and the ability to place facilities in such rights-of-way is necessary to accomplish requirements of nondiscriminatory treatment of the applicant in relation to the village's treatment of other communications service providers. In such circumstances, the applicant shall include with its village permit application, sufficient evidence consistent with industry standards, to justify such placement. Whenever small wireless facilities must be placed in a right-of-way with residential uses on one or both sides, neither poles, equipment, antennas or other structures shall be placed directly in front of a residential structure. If a right-of-way has residential structures on only one side, the small wireless facilities shall be located on the opposite side of the right-of-way whenever possible. All small wireless facilities shall be located in such a way that they do not unreasonably interfere with views from residential structures, such as placement that is at the farthest point from the principal structure within the property line. 
(c)  Concealment. All new small wireless facilities within a public right-of-way shall be constructed using concealment techniques, as further described in subsection (d) below. In all residential and non-residential districts, the concealment technique to be utilized shall be through the installation of either (i) a decorative banner pole capable of concealing all equipment and related appurtenances within the pole structure or located under the ground, or design wrapped on the ground adjacent to the wireless facility support structure; or (ii) a concealed facility designed to replicate existing standard or decorative street lights located in the applicable zoning district. In the Equestrian Overlay Zoning District, the concealment technique to be utilized may be through the installation of a decorative banner and/or pedestrian scale pole designed to be consistent with the equestrian nature of the Equestrian Preservation Areas, and capable of concealing all equipment and related appurtenances within the pole structure. The village engineer shall determine the applicable concealment technique for each proposed facility pursuant to the parameters described in subsection (d) below. In all instances, exterior looping of excess cable length installed on any small wireless facility or non-exempt micro wireless facility located in the public right-of-way is prohibited and all cabling and interconnecting wires must be concealed. 
(d)  Design standards. In addition to the concealment requirements set forth in subsection (c) above, wireless communication facilities shall meet all applicable design standards. Specifically: 
(1)  All underground portions of wireless communications facilities shall be placed in conduit using material subject to review and approval by the village engineer. The village engineer may permit the use of "trenchless technology" for installation in lieu of traditional installation methods but in all instances the underground portions of the wireless communications facility shall be contained within conduit material following installation. 
(2)  The village prefers that all underground facilities, poles, and all associated equipment should be placed in utility easements, dedicated for such a purpose, wherever utility easements exist, even if this means the underground facilities and associated equipment will be placed outside of the road right-of-way, on private property. 
(3)  All underground facilities must be buried at a minimum depth of 24-inches below existing grade. 
(4)  Conflicts between small wireless facilities (poles, underground facilities, and above ground equipment) and existing village-owned utilities including but not limited to potable water, sanitary sewer, stormwater drainage, and reclaimed water must be avoided, wherever possible. When avoiding conflicts with village-owned utilities is not feasible, the following minimum separations apply: 
1.  Horizontal separation: 10-ft preferred; 6-ft minimum 
2.  Vertical separation: 2-ft minimum 
3.  Small wireless facility underground conduit must be placed below existing village-owned utilities. 
4.  The village engineer has the authority to allow lesser separations from village-owned utility infrastructure where deemed necessary. 
(5)  The images below this section depict some examples of small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facility pole types deemed acceptable by the Village of Wellington. These depictions are not meant to be inclusive. Other similar pole types may be deemed acceptable by the Village of Wellington Engineering Department, on a case by case basis, but must be presented to the Engineering Department for approval. The exact pole type proposed by an applicant will be chosen by the Village of Wellington Engineering Department and shall be based on the character of the surrounding neighborhood and harmony of the proposed pole type with the surrounding neighborhood. The following small wireless or non-exempt micro wireless facility pole criteria must be met in order to achieve permit approval: 
i.  All equipment, meters, cables, or other attachments shall be either contained within the interior or concealed upon the exterior of the pole structure. 
ii.  The antenna element located on the top of the pole shall be encased in a shroud or other concealment element. Although the village recognizes that the antenna element may be larger in diameter than the pole itself, in no instance shall the antenna element have a diameter greater than two times that of the pole. 
iii.  The pole must include a street light, pedestrian pathway light, or both, depending on the proposed location of the pole, together with design elements to permit affixation of a banner to the pole. If the pole is to be placed in close proximity to a vehicular travel way, a street light shall be included in the design of the pole. The street light shall be placed at a height similar to that of other street lights already existing along the roadway. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of electricity for the light and the maintenance of same. If the pole is to be placed in close proximity to a pedestrian pathway, a pedestrian pathway light shall be included in the design of the pole. The pedestrian pathway light shall be placed at a height similar to that of other pedestrian pathway lights already existing along the pathway. If the proposed location of the pole is between a vehicular travel way and a pedestrian pathway, where existing lighting exists along the roadway and pedestrian pathway, then both a street light and a pedestrian pathway light shall be included in the design of the pole. Where existing lights exist, the type and character of the light, whether a street light, pedestrian pathway light, or both, shall be similar to that of the existing lights. 
iv.  The village's preference is for the equipment cabinet, meter, and any other required non-antenna equipment be built into the base of the pole. The village recognizes that this may not always be possible due to utility company requirements or space limitations such as, but not limited to, minimum sidewalk width or minimum roadside offsets. When these utility company requirements or space limitations exist, the village shall permit a separate cabinet to be installed adjacent to the proposed pole. A single cabinet including all necessary equipment is preferred and multiple cabinets or boxes shall not be permitted when a single cabinet can be utilized. When a separate cabinet is necessary, the proposed cabinet shall be covered on all exposed sides by a polymer wrap. The color and aesthetic design of the polymer wrap shall be selected by the Village of Wellington Engineering Department based on the subject location. The wrap design type shall be provided to the permittee in the permit approval package. 
v.  In each approved application for a new wireless communications facility in a right-of-way, the village shall be given the right by the permittee to attach and maintain a banner to the pole. The type of banner, wording, colors, and pictorial elements of the banner shall be chosen at the sole discretion of the village. 
vi.  All new proposed poles shall be painted either gray or green at the sole discretion of the Village of Wellington. The exact paint color of the proposed pole shall be selected by the Village of Wellington Engineering Department. The exact paint color shall be provided to the permittee in the permit approval package. The Village of Wellington reserves the right to change the preferred color(s) of any and all proposed poles, prior to permit approval, at its sole discretion. 
 
 
All collocations on existing utility poles shall utilize shrouds or canisters to conceal the antenna mounted on the top of the utility poles, such as the examples below, and shall either route transmission lines and cables through the interior of the poles when possible or use color matched conduit to conceal lines and cables on the exterior of the existing poles: 
 
(6)  The use of landscaping around any pole or external equipment, cabinet, box or vault may be required as a buffer to further achieve concealment. Such landscaping shall be consistent with the landscaping otherwise located in the public rights-of-way. Additional landscaping may be required if deemed necessary to buffer adjacent properties. In addition, for concealment purposes, all wireless communications facilities and accompanying equipment must blend into the surrounding environment by utilizing appropriate design wraps and/or colors as described above. As a condition of approval, the village engineer, or his/her designee, may require all buffering required in connection with the use of wireless communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be maintained by the owner of such facilities at its own cost. 
(7)  All above ground installations associated with a wireless communications facility within the village right-of-way are subject to minimum roadside offset and clear zone requirements as specified in the latest edition of the Florida Department of Transportation standards manuals.

(1)  Code compliance. The permittee shall at all times maintain compliance with all applicable Codes, including federal, state and local laws, regulations and other rules, including, without limitation, those applying to use of rights-of-way. 
(2)  Inspections; emergencies. The village or its designee may enter onto the facility area to visually inspect the communications facility upon 48 hours prior notice to the permittee. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections and may be present for any inspection of its communications facility by the village. The village reserves the right to examine or direct its designee to examine the facility and support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the facility in an emergency when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property. The village shall make every effort to contact the permittee prior to disabling or removing any facility elements, but in any case shall notify permittee within 24 hours of doing so. 
(3)  Contact. The permittee shall at all times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address and email address for at least one natural person. 
(4)  Indemnities. The permittee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the village, its agents, officers, officials, and employees (i) from any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses, and from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus, and other actions or proceedings brought against the village or its agents, officers, officials, or employees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the village's approval of the permit, and (ii) from any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses, and any and all claims, demands, law suits, or causes of action and other actions or proceedings of any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, arising out of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or any of each one's agents, employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent contractors excepting therefrom any damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses that are the result of the negligent, intentional or willful and wanton acts of the village, its agents, officers, officials and employees. Further, permittees shall be strictly liable for interference caused by their facilities with the village's communications systems. Whenever the village encounters radio frequency interference with its public safety communications equipment, and it believes that such interference has been or is being caused by one or more wireless communications facilities, the village shall provide notification to all wireless providers operating in the village of possible interference with the public safety communications equipment, and upon such notifications, the wireless providers shall use their best efforts to cooperate and coordinate with the village and among themselves to investigate and mitigate the interference, if any, utilizing the procedures set forth in the joint wireless industry-public safety "Enhanced Best Practices Guide," released by the FCC in Appendix D of FCC 04-168 (released August 6, 2004), including the "good engineering practices," as may be amended or revised by the FCC from time to time in any successor regulations. If any wireless provider fails to cooperate with the village in complying with the wireless provider's obligations under this section or if the FCC makes a determination of radio frequency interference with the village public safety communications equipment, the wireless provider who failed to cooperate and/or the owner of the equipment that caused the interference shall be responsible, upon FCC determination of radio frequency interference, for reimbursing the village for all costs associated with ascertaining and resolving the interference, including but not limited to any engineering studies obtained by the village to determine the source of the interference. For the purposes of this subsection, failure to cooperate shall include failure to initiate any response or action as described in the "best practices guide" within 24 hours of village's notification. 
(5)  Adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Permittee shall undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid material adverse impacts to adjacent properties and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, and removal of the facility. 
(6)  General maintenance; graffiti. The site and the facility, including, but not limited to, any landscaping, concealment elements, and related transmission equipment, must be maintained in a neat, orderly, and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans and conditions of approval. All graffiti on facilities must be removed at the sole expense of the permittee within seven days after notification from the village. 
(7)  RF exposure compliance. All facilities must comply with all standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards. All applications must demonstrate compliance by including a certified analysis showing that the proposed facility satisfies the FCC's Radio-Frequency ("RF") exposure guidelines applicable on an individual basis, and on a cumulative basis (considering all frequencies, and all emitting sources as required by FCC regulations). After transmitter and antenna system optimization, but prior to unattended operations of the facility, permittee or its representative must conduct on-site post-installation RF emissions testing to demonstrate actual compliance with the FCC OET Bulletin 65 RF emissions safety rules for general population/uncontrolled RF exposure in all sectors. For this testing, the transmitter shall be operating at maximum operating power, and the testing shall occur outwards to a distance where the RF emissions no longer exceed the uncontrolled/general population limit. 
(8)  Testing. Testing of any back-up generators and other noise producing equipment associated with any communications facility located within a village right-of-way shall take place on weekdays only, and only between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., except that testing is prohibited on holidays that fall on a weekday. In addition, testing is prohibited on weekend days. 
(9)  Utilities undergrounded. Extensions of electrical and communications land lines to serve any communications facility located in the village right-of-way shall be undergrounded where the existing electrical and communications facilities are located below grade. 
(10)  Other approvals. The permittee shall obtain all other applicable permits, approvals, and agreements necessary to install and operate the facility in conformance with federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations. 
(11)  Modifications. No changes shall be made to the approved plans without review and approval in accordance with this chapter subject to the exemptions provided in F.S. § 337.401(7)(e).

Alternatively, the village may require the permittee to provide such make-ready estimate at permittee's expense for the work necessary to support the facility, including a pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate shall include the design, fabrication and installation of a pole that is substantially similar in color, size, and composition to the existing pole. The replacement pole shall remain the property of the village. 
(13)  Village not liable. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to make or hold the village responsible or liable for any damage to persons or any property whatsoever, from any cause whatsoever, arising from the use, operation or condition of the permittee's wireline or wireless communications facilities; or by reason of any inspection or reinspection authorized herein or failure to inspect or reinspect. Nor shall the issuance of any permit or the approval or disapproval of any placement or maintenance of the permittee's wireline or wireless communications facilities as authorized herein constitute any representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by, nor create any liability upon, the village or any official, agent or employee 
(14)  Construction bond. 
(a)  Prior to performing any permitted work in the village's rights-of-way, the village shall require the permittee and/or owner of the communications facility to establish in the village's favor a performance and payment bonds in an amount equal to a minimum of 110 percent of the cost of the work being permitted, exclusive of equipment cost to secure the restoration of the public rights-of-way, and to ensure the permittee's and/or owner's faithful performance of the construction or other obligations related to the work in the public rights-of-way, in accordance with applicable sections of the Village Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  In the event a permittee and/or owner of the communications facility fails to complete the work in accordance with the provisions of the permit and this subdivision, or fails to complete all restoration work in the right-of-way as required by the village, including but not limited to repair or replacement of damaged landscaping, structures, hardscape, underground utility facilities, structures or equipment, or any other item or feature disturbed by the permitted work, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the village as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any property of the permittee or owner, or the cost of completing the work, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond. 
(c)  No less than 12 months after completion of the construction and satisfaction of all obligations in accordance with the bonds, the permittee and/or owner of the communications facility may request the village engineer or his/her designee to remove the requirement to continue the bonds and the village, if the communications facility is completed, shall release the bonds within ten days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall require a new bond for any subsequent work performed in the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  The bonds shall be issued by a surety; (i) authorized to do business in the State of Florida and having evidenced same by a certificate of good standing from the Florida Department of State, and (ii) having a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; the bond shall be subject to the approval of the village attorney; and shall provide that: 
"Unless released by the Village, this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the Village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
(e)  The rights reserved by the village with respect to any bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the village may have under this section, or at law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the bonds will affect any other right the village may have. 
(15)  Conflicts with improvements. Except as may be otherwise provided by F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, for all communications facilities located within the right-of-way, the permittee shall remove or relocate, at its expense and without expense to the village, any or all of its facilities when such removal or relocation is deemed necessary by the village by reason of any change of grade, alignment, or width of any right-of-way, for installation of services, water pipes, drains, storm drains, power or signal lines, traffic control devices, right-of-way improvements, or for any other construction, repair, or improvement to the right-of-way. Any removal or relocation required under this paragraph shall be completed by permittee within 90 days of receipt of notice from the village. In the event permittee fails to abide by this timeframe, and permittee's failure to remove or relocate its facilities impedes the progress of the project that necessitated said removal or relocation, the village shall have the right to cure this deficiency, and recover the costs incurred in doing so by drawing on the required performance bond. In such a case, the village shall bear no liability for any damage or disruption to permittee's facilities or operations directly or indirectly resulting from the village's reasonable efforts to cure permittee's noncompliance with this paragraph. 
(16)  Vacation. Permittee shall notify the village engineer of the intent to vacate a facility at least 30 days prior to the vacation. 
(17)  Abandonment. If a facility is not operated for a continuous period of nine months, the wireless permit and any other permit or approval therefor shall be deemed abandoned and terminated automatically, unless before the end of the nine-month period (i) the village engineer has determined that the facility has resumed operations, or (ii) the village has received an application to transfer the permit to another service provider. No later than 90 days from the date the facility is determined to have ceased operation or the permittee has notified the village engineer of its intent to vacate the site, the permittee shall remove all equipment and improvements associated with the use and shall restore the site to its original condition to the satisfaction of the village engineer. The permittee shall provide written verification of the removal of the facilities within 30 days of the date the removal is completed. If the facility is not removed within 30 days after the permit has been discontinued pursuant to this subsection, the site shall be deemed to be a nuisance, and the village may cause the facility to be removed at permittee's expense. If there are two or more users of a single facility or support structure, then this provision shall apply to the specific elements or parts thereof that were abandoned, but will not be effective for the entirety thereof until all users cease use thereof. 
(18)  Encourage co-location. Where the facility site is capable of accommodating a co-located facility upon the same site, the owner and operator of the existing facility shall allow another carrier to co-locate its facilities and equipment thereon, provided the parties can mutually agree upon reasonable terms and conditions. 
(19)  Compliance. The permittee must at all times construct, operate, and maintain the facility in accordance with all permits, requirements, applicable codes, and approvals. 
(20)  Force majeure. In the event the village's or permittee's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this chapter is prevented by a cause or event not within the village's or permittee's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result, provided, however, that such permittee uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For the purposes of this section, cause or events not within the village's or permittee's control shall include, but not be limited to, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes, and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court. Causes or events within a permittee's control, and thus not falling within this section shall include without limitation, permittee's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of permittee's directors, officers, employees, contractors, or agents. 
(b)  Eligible facilities requests. An application to add a second wireless communications facility to an existing wireless communications facility located within a right-of-way that meets the specifications for an "eligible facilities request" under section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, (47 USC § 1455(a)) and does not cause the existing wireless communications facility to exceed the definition of "small wireless facility" as defined herein shall be subject to the processing and approval by the village engineer or his/her designee pursuant to the processes outlined in this chapter and shall be subject to the following conditions, unless modified by the approving authority: 
(1)  General conditions. The conditions provided in section 23-7 of this chapter shall apply to the extent permissible by law. 
(2)  No permit term extension. The village's grant or grant by operation of law of an eligible facilities request permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject wireless facility. The village's grant or grant by operation of law of an eligible facilities request permit will not extend the permit term for the underlying permit or any other underlying regulatory approval, and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the subject tower or base station. 
(3)  No waiver of standing. The village's grant or grant by operation of law of an eligible facilities request does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the village to challenge Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, or any modification to Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act.

Sec. 33-53. - Findings. 
It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared: 
(1)  Pursuant to Article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and sections 166.021 and 166.041, Florida Statutes, the council has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions, except when prohibited by law, and such powers may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of village ordinances. 
(2)  The council may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose, except when expressly prohibited by law, and the council may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes. The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes, is not relevant to the imposition of a road impact fee or a park impact fee. 
(3)  The council specifically finds that the village park system and the village street system benefit all residents of the village, and therefore, the park impact fee and the road impact fee shall be imposed in all incorporated areas of the village. 
(4)  Development necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan will require improvements and additions to the village street system and the village park system to accommodate the traffic generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service adopted by the village. 
(5)  Future growth, as represented by road impact construction and parks and recreational facilities impact construction, should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the village street system and village park system that are required to accommodate the traffic generated by such growth and the use of such parks and recreational facilities by such growth. 
(6)  The required improvements and additions to the village street system and village park system needed to eliminate any deficiencies between the existing village street system and village park system and the levels of service adopted by the village shall be financed by revenue sources of the village other than road impact fees and park impact fees. 
(7)  Implementation of a road impact fee and a park impact fee to require future road impact construction and parks and recreational facilities impact construction to contribute its fair share to the cost of required transportation and park capital improvements and additions is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the comprehensive plan of the village. 
(8)  The imposition of a park impact fee and a road impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction or improvement of the village park system and the village street system, respectively, necessitated by growth as delineated in the capital improvement element of the comprehensive plan. 
(9)  The council expressly finds that the schedule of improvements and additions to the designated village roads, as contained in the study entitled "Impact Fee Rate Study for Roads and Parks and Recreational Facilities, Village of Wellington, Florida," provides a benefit to all road impact construction within the village in excess of the road impact fee. 
(10)  The village has the statutory responsibility to provide and maintain roads in the village street system. Road impact construction occurring within the village impacts upon the village street system; therefore, road impact construction should pay its fair share of the cost of providing the improvements and additions to the designated village roads. In recognition of these findings, it is the intent of the council that, upon approval and adoption of this chapter and the impact fee study by the council, the village shall impose a road impact fee to provide the cost of growth-required improvements and additions to designated village roads. 
(11)  The projected capital improvements and additions to designated village roads and the allocation of projected costs between those improvements and additions necessary to serve existing development and those improvements and additions required to accommodate the growth represented by road impact construction as presented in the study entitled "Impact Fee Rate Study for Roads and Parks and Recreational Facilities, Village of Wellington, Florida" is hereby approved and adopted by the village, and such projections are hereby found to be in conformity with the comprehensive plan. 
(12)  Transportation planning is an evolving process and the capital improvements and additions to the village street system identified upon the date of the adoption of this chapter constitute projections of growth patterns and transportation improvements and additions based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the council that the identified improvements and additions to the village street system be reviewed and adjusted periodically, pursuant to section 33-208, to ensure that road impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully and are utilized effectively based upon actual and anticipated traffic conditions at the time of their imposition. 
(13)  The process of transportation planning requires the coordination of improvements and additions to the state highway system, village street system and county road system. However, the road impact fee imposed by the village pursuant to section 33-101 will not be used to finance any road improvements to the county road system or the state highway system. Furthermore, this chapter shall not be construed to permit the expending or encumbering of any monies collected through road impact fees for the construction of improvements or additions to roads which are not contained within the village street system. 
(14)  The projected standards for parks and recreational facilities for the village park system as presented in the study entitled "Impact Fee Rate Study for Roads and Parks and Recreational Facilities, Village of Wellington, Florida" is hereby approved and adopted by the village, and such projections are hereby found to be in conformity with the comprehensive plan. 
(15)  The council expressly finds that the maintenance of the standards for parks and recreational facilities, as contained in the study entitled "Impact Fee Rate Study for Roads and Parks and Recreational Facilities, Village of Wellington, Florida" provides a benefit to all parks and recreational facilities impact construction within the village in excess of the park impact fee. 
(16)  The village has the responsibility to provide parks in the village park system. Parks and recreational facilities impact construction occurring within the village impacts upon the village park system; therefore, parks and recreational facilities impact construction should pay its fair share of the cost of maintaining the village's standard of service. In recognition of these findings, it is the intent of the council that, upon approval and adoption of this chapter and the impact fee study by the council, the village shall impose a park impact fee to provide the cost of growth-required additions to the village park system. 
(17)  Capital planning is an evolving process, and the standard of service for the village park system constitutes a projection of anticipated needs for parks and recreational facilities, based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the council that the standard of service for the village park system and the park impact fee imposed be reviewed and adjusted periodically, pursuant to section 33-208, to ensure that park impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully, based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition. 
(18)  This chapter shall not be construed to permit the collection of park impact fees from parks and recreational facilities impact construction for those parks developed and maintained by the county. 
(19)  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the development of land within the village by requiring payment of road impact fees by road impact construction and park impact fees by parks and recreational facilities impact construction and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the village street system and the village park system which are required to accommodate such growth. This chapter shall not be construed to permit the collection of road impact fees or park impact fees in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the village street system or the village park system generated by such road impact construction or such parks and recreational facilities impact construction, respectively. 
(20)  On or about November 10, 1998, the village council of the Village of Wellington, Florida adopted village Ordinance No. 98-31, known as the "Village of Wellington, Florida Road Impact Fee and Parks and Recreational Facilities Impact Fee Ordinance," which imposed road impact fees and park impact fees on road impact construction and parks and recreational facilities impact construction within the corporate limits of the village. 
(21)  Pursuant to section 33-208, the impact fee ordinance and the associated impact fee study are to be reviewed at least every five years by the village council to evaluate and revise, if necessary, the road impact fee to ensure that it does not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs associated with the improvements and additions necessary to offset the demand generated by road impact construction on the village street system and the park impact fee to ensure that it does not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs associated with the improvements and additions necessary to offset the demand generated by park impact construction on the village park system. 
(22)  The review required by section 33-208 must consider new estimates of population and other socioeconomic data, changes in construction, land acquisition and related costs, adjustments to the assumptions, conclusions, or findings set forth in the impact fee study, changes in right-of-way acquisition and related costs, and changes in trip generation rates, external trip lengths, and traffic volume counts. 
(23)  In the event the review required by section 33-208 alters or changes the assumptions, conclusions, and findings of the impact fee study, revises or changes the designated village roads or the village park system or alters or changes the amount or classification of the road impact fee or the park impact fee, the impact fee study shall be amended and updated to reflect the assumptions, conclusions, and findings of such reviews, and section 33-54 shall be amended to adopt by reference such updated studies. 
(24)  In accordance with this review requirement, the village has undertaken a review of the road impact fee and park impact fee and considered all factors identified in section 33-208. The village now desires to amend this chapter, to reflect the updated assumptions, conclusions, and findings from such review, including an updated list of designated village roads and an updated schedule of road impact fees and park impact fees. 
(25)  The council hereby acknowledges and confirms the legislative findings contained in subsections (1) through (21) herein and expressly reaffirms such findings as applicable to the updated road impact fees, the updated park impact fees, the updated impact fee study and the updated list of designated village roads to be adopted herein. Moreover, the council expressly finds that the schedule of improvements and additions to the updated list of designated village roads, as contained in the updated impact fee study, which is attached hereto as Appendix B and incorporated herein by reference and as further updated by the Village of Wellington Road Impact Fee Study Update, dated August 24, 2004, which is attached hereto as Appendix E and incorporated herein by reference, provides a benefit to all road impact construction within the village in excess of the updated road impact fee. Additionally, the council expressly finds that the schedule of improvements and additions to the list of parks improvements as contained in the updated park impact fee study, which is attached hereto as Appendix C and incorporated herein by reference, and the update of the parks and recreation facilities impact fee study dated November 21, 2003, which is attached hereto as Appendix D and incorporated herein by reference provides a benefit to all parks impact construction within the village in excess of the updated parks impact fee. 
(26)  The projected capital improvements and additions to the updated list of designated village roads and park improvements and the allocation of projected costs between those improvements and additions necessary to serve existing development and those improvements and additions required to accommodate the growth represented by road impact construction as presented in the updated impact fee study attached hereto as Appendix B and the updated park impact fee study attached hereto as Appendix C and the update of the parks and recreation facilities impact fee study dated November 21, 2003, which is attached hereto as Appendix D are hereby approved and adopted by the village and such projections are found to be in conformity with the comprehensive plan.

DIVISION 2. - ROAD IMPACT FEES 
 
Sec. 33-101. - Imposition. 
(a)  All road impact construction occurring within the incorporated area of the village shall pay the road impact fee established in this chapter. 
(b)  The council hereby adopts road impact fees, which are hereby imposed upon all road impact construction occurring within the village at a rate established in accordance with the following road impact fee calculation formula: 
Vehicle Miles Traveled × Net Cost per Vehicle Miles Traveled 
The Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT) represents the road impact of new development on the Village's roadway system. Calculation of the VMT is based on the following formula: 
VMT = (Daily Trip Rate/2) × (Percent New Trips) × (Village Portion of Trip Length) 
The factors influencing the VMT are based on the trip characteristics by land use category that are provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) "Trip Generation" Manual (Seventh Edition) and that were derived for the average trip length. The net cost per VMT for the purpose of the road impact fee schedule calculation is $166.38. The following schedule is illustrative of the results of the calculation. Road impact fees based on the formula shall apply to all road impact construction that receive a building permit on or after (the effective date of this section October 12, 2004).

Editor's note Ord. No. 2002-33, §§ 5, 6, adopted Jan. 28, 2003, repealed the former § 33-101, and enacted a new § 33-101 as set out herein. The former § 33-101 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 98-31, § 2.01, adopted Nov. 10, 1998.  
Sec. 33-102. - Alternative road impact fee calculation. 
(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact to the village street system necessitated by its road impact construction is less than the new net trips that are assumed under the applicable impact fee land use category specified in section 33-101, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such road impact construction, file with the impact fee coordinator a notice of intent to submit alternative road impact fee. The impact fee coordinator shall review the calculations and make a determination within ten days of submittal as to whether such calculation complies with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  For purposes of any alternative road impact fee calculation, the road impact construction shall be presumed to have the maximum impact on the village street system for the trip generation land use category contemplated under the road impact fee rate. 
(c)  The alternative road impact fee calculation shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this chapter and the impact fee study or an independent source, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is a generally accepted standard source of transportation engineering or planning information; or 
(2)  The independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed by a professional engineer pursuant to a generally accepted methodology of transportation planning or engineering. 
(3)  If a previously approved road impact construction project submitted, during its approval process, a traffic impact study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the impact fee coordinator to be current, the traffic impacts of such previously approved road impact construction shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative road impact fee shall be established reflecting the traffic impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a traffic impact study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(4)  It is acknowledged that the road impact fee rates are based upon the applicable trip generator rates for the trip generation land use categories corresponding to the impact fee land use categories set forth in section 33-101. In recognition of such acknowledgment, the trip generator rates for the trip generation land use categories shall be considered an independent source for the purpose of an alternative road impact fee calculation without the necessity of a study as required by subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(d)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant comply with the requirements of this section and that the calculation of the alternative road impact fee was by a generally accepted methodology, then the alternative road impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in section 33-101. 
(e)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant do not comply with the requirements of this section or that the calculation of the alternative road impact fee was not by a generally accepted methodology, then the impact fee coordinator shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative road impact fee and the reasons therefore. The applicant shall have 30 days from the receipt of the written notification of rejection to request a hearing pursuant to section 33-207. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § 2.02, 11-10-98)  
Sec. 33-103. - Use of road impact fee proceeds. 
(a)  The council hereby establishes a separate trust account for the road impact fee, to be designated as the "Road Impact Fee Trust Account," which shall be maintained separate and apart from all other accounts of the village. All road impact fees shall be deposited into such trust account immediately upon receipt. 
(b)  The monies deposited into the road impact fee trust account shall be used solely for the purpose of constructing or improving designated village roads, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Design and construction plan preparation; 
(2)  Permitting; 
(3)  Right-of-way acquisition, including any costs of acquisition or condemnation; 
(4)  Construction of new through lanes; 
(5)  Construction of new turn lanes; 
(6)  Construction of new bridges; 
(7)  Construction of new drainage facilities in conjunction with new roadway construction; 
(8)  Purchase and installation of traffic signals; 
(9)  Construction of new curbs, medians and shoulders; 
(10)  Relocating utilities to accommodate new roadway construction; 
(11)  Construction management and inspection; 
(12)  Surveying and soils and material testing; 
(13)  Repayment of monies transferred or borrowed from any budgetary fund of the village which were used to fund any growth impacted construction or improvements as herein defined; and 
(14)  Payment of principal and interest, necessary reserves and costs of issuance under any bonds or other indebtedness issued by the village to provide funds to construct or acquire growth impacted capital transportation improvements on designated village roads. 
Funds on deposit in the road impact fee trust account shall not be used for any expenditure that would be classified as a maintenance or repair expense. 
(c)  The monies deposited into the road impact fee trust account shall be used solely to provide improvements and additions to the designated village roads required to accommodate traffic generated by growth as projected in the impact fee study. 
(d)  Any monies on deposit which are not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested by the village. All income derived from such investments shall be deposited in the road impact fee trust account and used as provided herein. 
(e)  The road impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter may be returned to the then current owner of the property on behalf of which such fee was paid if such fees have not been expended or encumbered prior to the end of the fiscal year immediately following the sixth anniversary of the date upon which such fees were paid. Refunds shall be made only in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The then current owner shall petition the impact fee coordinator for the refund within 90 days following the end of the fiscal year immediately following the sixth anniversary date on which the road impact fee was paid. 
(2)  The petition for refund shall be submitted to the impact fee coordinator and shall contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the then current owner of the property on behalf of which the road impact fee was paid; 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of such fee or such other record as would indicate payment of such fee; 
c.  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed; and 
d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill. 
(3)  Within three months from the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the impact fee coordinator will advise the owner of the status of the road impact fee requested for refund, and if such road impact fee has not been spent or encumbered within the applicable time period, then it shall be returned to the petitioner with interest paid at the rate of six percent per annum or the average net interest rate earned by the village in the road impact fee trust account during the time such refunded road impact fee was on deposit, whichever is less. The village shall retain two percent of the road impact fee to offset the costs of administering the refund. For the purposes of this section, fees collected shall be deemed to be spent or encumbered on the basis of the first fee in shall be the first fee out.

(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact to the village park system necessitated by its parks and recreational facilities impact construction is less than the fee established in section 33-151, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such parks and recreational facilities impact construction, submit a calculation of an alternative park impact fee to the impact fee coordinator pursuant to the provisions of this section. The impact fee coordinator shall review the calculations and make a determination within ten days of submittal as to whether such calculation complies with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  The alternative park impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this chapter and the impact fee study or an independent source, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is a generally accepted standard source of planning information, or 
(2)  The independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed by a professional engineer pursuant to a generally accepted methodology of planning or engineering. 
(3)  If a previously approved parks and recreational facilities impact construction project submitted, during its approval process, an alternative parks and recreational impact fee study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the impact fee coordinator to be current, the parks and recreational impacts of such previously approved parks and recreational facilities impact construction shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative park impact fee shall be established reflecting the impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative parks and recreational facility impact fee study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(c)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative park impact fee comply with the requirements of this section and that the calculation of the alternative park impact fee was by a generally accepted methodology, then the alternative park impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in section 33-151. 
(d)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant do not comply with the requirements of this section or that the calculation of the alternative park impact fee was not by a generally accepted methodology, then the impact fee coordinator shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative park impact fee and the reason therefore.

All orders shall be in writing and shall be signed and dated by the hearing officer. If, at the conclusion of the hearing or consideration of mailed-in admissible evidence, the hearing officer orders a dismissal of the citation because no violation was found, the hearing officer shall so state and issue an order of dismissal in writing signed and dated by the hearing officer which shall contain findings of the facts supporting the order. A copy of such order will be forwarded to the alleged violator.

Section 2. - Installation or location of facilities; interference with public rights-of-way. 
The facilities of the grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as not to unreasonably interfere with drainage canals in public rights-of-way which existed prior to the installation of grantee's facilities, or with traffic over the public rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. To avoid conflict with such drainage canals and traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the grantee may prescribe in accordance with reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way; provided, however, that such rules or regulations shall not prohibit the grantee's use of said public rights-of-way or unreasonably interfere with the grantee's ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of its customers. When any portion of a street is excavated by the grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the street so excavated shall within a reasonable time be replaced by the grantee at its expense and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation and in compliance with the standards under which the street was originally constructed. Grantor shall not be liable to the grantee for any cost or expense in connection with such location or relocation of grantee's facilities made necessary by the grantor's improvement of any of the present and future public rights-of-way used or occupied by the grantee hereunder, except, however, the grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs from funds available from sources other than the grantor as may be provided by law and for costs resulting from improvement of any drainage canal not in existence on the effective date hereof.  
Section 3. - Liability of grantor. 
The grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by the grantee of its electric facilities hereunder, and the acceptance of this ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the grantee to indemnify the grantor and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage, or expense which may accrue to the grantor by reason of the existence of grantee's facilities in the public rights-of-way or negligence, default or misconduct of the grantee in the construction, operation, or maintenance of its electric facilities hereunder.  
Section 4. - Rates, rules and regulations of grantee. 
All rates, rules and regulations established by the grantee from time to time shall at all times be reasonable and the grantee's rates for electricity shall at all times be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law.  
Section 5. - Payment for rights and privileges by grantee. 
As a consideration for this franchise, the grantee shall pay to the grantor no later than the end of Florida Power & Light Company's first monthly billing period ending after the effective date of this ordinance and no later than the end of each succeeding monthly billing period during the term of franchise, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges, and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem property taxes and nonad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the grantor against Florida Power & Light Company's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during Florida Power & Light Company's monthly billing period ending 30 days prior to each such payment will equal five percent of Florida Power & Light Company's billed revenues, less actual writeoffs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers within the incorporated areas of the grantor for the monthly billing period ending 30 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted in the franchise exceed five percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of Florida Power & Light Company.  
Section 6. - Considerations of grantor. 
As a further consideration of this franchise, the grantor agrees (a) not to engage in the business of distributing and selling electricity at retail during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof in competition with the grantee and (b) not to itself distribute, or seek to have the grantee transmit and/or distribute, electric power generated by or on behalf of the grantor at one location to the grantor's or any other retail customer's facilities at any other location(s).  
Section 7. - Termination of franchise by granteeUpon other grantees receiving more favorable conditions; notice. 
If the grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions that the grantee considers more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise. Such termination shall be effective on the last day of the month in which written notice termination is delivered to the grantor's clerk. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, inform the grantor of such terms and conditions.  
Section 8. - SameUpon competitive disadvantage; notice. 
If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United State of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the grantor to a customer then being served by the grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve, and the grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this franchise. Such termination shall be effective on the last day of the month in which written notice of termination is delivered to the grantor's clerk. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, inform the grantor of the circumstances which resulted in the exercise of its right to terminate.  
Section 9. - Failure of grantee to comply with ordinance; forfeiture; appeal; time for compliance. 
Failure on the part of the grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be grounds for forfeiture of this grant, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the grantee shall, as soon as practicable and in any event not later than six months after such final determination, make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right in the grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require.  
Section 10. - Failure of grantor to comply; remedy of breach; withholding of payments. 
Failure on the part of the grantor to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including: 
(a)  Denying the grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with traffic, drainage system use, operation or maintenance; 
(b)  Imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law and contrary to FPL's standard practices; or 
(c)  Unreasonable delay in the issuance of a permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, 
shall constitute a breach of this franchise. Grantee shall notify the grantor of any such breach in writing and the grantor shall remedy such breach as soon as practicable and in any event by not later than 90 days. Should the breach remain unresolved after 90 days, FPL, at its the sole discretion, may withhold all or part of the payments provided for in section 5 hereof until such time as the breach is remedied or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. Grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right to obtain a greater right than is granted herein.

CHAPTER 1. - GENERAL 

Sec. 1.1.1. - Title and citation. 
    This Code shall be known as the "Land Development Regulations" and may also be cited and referred to herein as this "Code" or the "LDR". 

(Ord. No. 2005-16, § 1, 6-28-2005) 
Sec. 1.1.2. - Authority. 
    The Village Council has the authority to adopt this Code pursuant to Article VIII, Sec. 1(f), Fla. Const., Sec. 125.01, et seq, .Fla. Stat., Sec. 163.3161, et. seq. Fla. Stat., Rule 9J-5, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), Rule 9J-24, F.A.C., and such other authorities and provisions that are established in the statutory or common law in the State of Florida. 
Sec. 1.1.3. - Findings. 
    The Village Council hereby makes the following findings: 
A.  Village of Wellington, pursuant to Sec. 163.3161, et. seq., Fla. Stat., the Florida Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (hereinafter the "Act"), is required to prepare and adopt a Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  After adoption of the Comprehensive Plan, the Act, and in particular Sec. 163.3202(1), Fla. Stat., mandates that the Village implement the adopted Comprehensive Plan with land development regulations that are consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
C.  Sec. 163.3194(1)(b), Fla. Stat., requires that all land development regulations enacted or amended by The Village shall be consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, and any land development regulations existing at the time of adoption which are not consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, shall be amended so as to be consistent. 
D.  Sec. 163.3194(1)(a), Fla. Stat., mandates that after a Comprehensive Plan has been adopted in conformity with the Act, all development undertaken by, and all actions taken in regard to development orders by, governmental agencies in regard to land covered by the Comprehensive Plan shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
E.  Pursuant to Sec. 163.3194(3)(a), Fla. Stat., a development order to land development regulations shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan if the land uses, densities or intensities, and other aspects of development permitted by such order or regulation are compatible with and further the objectives, policies, land uses, and densities or intensities in the Comprehensive Plan and if it meets all other criteria enumerated by the local government. 
F.  Sec. 163.3194(3)(b), Fla. Stat., states that a development approved or undertaken by a local government shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan if the land uses, densities or intensities, capacity or size, timing and other aspects of development are compatible with and further the objectives, policies, land uses, densities or intensities in the Comprehensive Plan and if it meets all other criteria enumerated by the local government. 
G.  In 1998, the Village adopted the Village Comprehensive Plan (hereinafter) the "Comprehensive Plan") as its Comprehensive Plan Pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 163.3161 et. seq., Fla. Stat., and Rule 9J-5, F.A.C. 
H.  This Code is adopted to implement the Comprehensive Plan. It is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, in part, because the land uses, densities, or intensities, capacity of size, timing, and other aspects of development permitted, further the objectives, policies, land uses, and densities and intensities in the Comprehensive Plan, and meet all other criteria enumerated in the Comprehensive Plan. 
I.  This Code is also adopted to preserve and enhance the present advantages that exist in the Village; encourage the most appropriate use of land, water, and natural resources, consistent with the public interest; overcome present handicaps, and deal effectively with future problems that may result from the use and development of land; prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration of population; facilitate the adequate and efficient provision of transportation, water, sewage, drainage, solid waste, parks, schools, fire and police facilities; conserve, develop, utilize, and protect natural resources; protect human, environmental, social, and economic resources; and maintain, through orderly growth and development, the community character and stability of present and future land uses and development in The Village.

B.  Comprehensive and consistent regulations. It is also the purpose of the Village Council that this Code establish comprehensive and consistent standards and procedures for the review and approval of all proposed development of land in The Village. 
C.  Efficient and effective regulations. It is the further purpose of the Village Council that the development review, approval, and permitting process under this Code be efficient, in term of time and expense, effective, in terms of addressing the natural resource and public facility implications of proposed development, and equitable, in terms of consistency with established regulations and procedures, respect for the rights of property owners, and consideration of the interest of the citizens of The Village. 
CHAPTER 2. - RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
    The adoption of this Code is consistent with, compatible with and furthers the goals, objectives, policies, land uses, and densities or intensities in the Comprehensive Plan. 
CHAPTER 3. - APPLICABILITY 
    The provisions of this Code shall apply to the development of all land in the Village, except as expressly and specifically provided otherwise in this Code. No development shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to this Code. 
CHAPTER 4. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 
    The provisions of this Code are the minimum requirements necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Code and implement and ensure consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. 
CHAPTER 5. - EXEMPTIONS; EFFECT OF CODE AND AMENDMENTS OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DEVELOPMENT ORDERS 

Sec. 1.5.1. - General. 
    As provided in this Section, the provisions of this Code and any amendments hereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully approved development order approved prior to the effective date of this Code if the development order remains valid. Specifically, uses, site design elements and tabular data shown on a valid building permit, a certified master plan or site plan, or an approved subdivision plan or land development permit will not be subject to LDR provisions for any information clearly shown. 
Sec. 1.5.2. - Subsequent Development Orders and Applications in Process. 
A.  General. The section establishes a procedure which honors previously approved development orders and the associated site elements and requires that subsequent development orders comply with this Code. This section recognizes that conflicts may arise when a development previously approved has not obtained a final development order. In cases of such conflict, the Planning & Zoning Director and the Village Engineer shall advise an applicant to what extent this Code shall be applied. The Planning & Zoning Director and the Village Engineer shall apply the standards of this Code to the greatest extent physically possible given the constraints of the site, the constraints of the existing valid plats of record, the provisions of this section, and the need to mitigate impacts to assure compatibility. 
B.  No final development order. Projects with a valid development order which are required to have but do not have either: (1) a certified master plan or site plan, or (2) an approved subdivision plan or land development permit, may apply for certification or approval of the subsequent development permit as provided herein. Uses or site design elements not specifically shown on an approved plan shall be required to comply with this Code, or any amendments hereto, for the purposes of obtaining a subsequent development order, unless otherwise provided in Section 1.5.B.2.b), below. 
1.  Any applications for certification or approval of a master plan, site plan, subdivision plan or land development permit may be accepted, reviewed and approved under the standards of ordinance 73-2 and 73-4, as amended, provided: 
a.  the application is approved or certified prior to September 30, 1992; 
b.  provided the application is in compliance with Ordinance 73-2 and 73-4, as amended: 
c.  the development order is valid; and 
d.  the landscaping is improved to comply with the standards of this Code, as follows 
i.  Projects with a development order issued prior to April 8, 1986 shall be required to comply with the Landscape Code in Article 7 of the LDR; except that residential projects over eighty (80) percent built-out shall be exempt from this requirement. 
ii.  Projects with a development order approved on or after April 8, 1986 shall be required to comply with perimeter Landscape Standards in Article 7 of the LDR; except that residential projects over eighty (80) percent built-out shall be exempt from this requirement. 
2.  Issuance of subsequent development orders shall be based on the requirements if this Code, except where a requirement of this Code and physical constraints of a site render a previously approved site element not fully usable. In such cases, the requirements of this Code may be modified to allow a subsequent development order to be approved consistent with the density or intensity, or other site element shown on a previously approved plan. Through the DRC, the specific property development regulation (Article 6) of site development requirement (Article 7, except sections 7.5, and 7.6, and Article 17) causing conflict may be modified, and a subsequent development order may be issued, using the following procedure. 
a.  The development shall use flexible regulations, described in Sec. 6.8 of this Code. If still unable to use a previously approved site element then, 
b.  The applicant may elect to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that a subsequent development order implementing the previously approved site element could have been approved pursuant to ordinance 73-2, as amended to June 22, 1992. For residential development, housing classifications may not change to accommodate density. 
C.  Applications filed prior to the effective date of this Code. An application for a special exception, special permit, district boundary change (rezoning), site plan review committee approval, subdivision plan or land development permit, or a building permit which is filed with and accepted by the department prior to the effective date of this Code may be reviewed and processed under the terms of Ordinances No. 73-2 and 73-4, as amended. In addition, all relevant applications shall be certified by prehearing conference on or before the effective date of this Code and receive site plan or subdivision certification on or before September 30, 1992, in order to continue to be reviewed and processed under the terms of Ordinances 73-2 and 73-4, as amended. However, these applications must also comply with Sec. 1.5.B.2.a.(4).(b) herein. After approval, the application shall be considered a project with a valid development order for the purposes of modifications and applicability of the general requirements of this Code, or any amendments hereto. Applications submitted after September 30, 1992 shall be reviewed under the standards of this Code. 
D.  Subsequent development orders and modifications to previously approved development orders and permits. The provisions of the LDR shall apply to any request to modify any development order or permit. However, only the area directly effected by the proposed modifications shall be subject to the LDR, except that non-residential projects shall provide additional landscape improvements provided no required parking or intensity is lost. A Landscape Betterment Plan may be submitted to ensure no required parking or intensity is lost. 
1.  Non-residential projects which have not commenced development. Non-residential projects which have not commenced development shall be required to comply with the Landscape Code in Article 7 of the LDR for the entire site. 
2.  Previous commencement of development. Non-residential projects which have commenced development on site shall install additional landscaping as follows: 
3.  Newly developed freestanding building part of a larger project. Freestanding buildings with vehicular circulation on four (4) sides shall provide additional landscaping for the unmodified portion of the project at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the landscaping to be installed at the new development, or 
4.  Renovation or additions. Structural additions or renovation to previously approved uses shall comply with the landscaping requirements of this code when the value of the addition or renovation exceeds thirty five percent (35%) of the appraised value of the parcel on which renovations shall occur. 
5.  All requests for modifications to a previously approved development order. All requests for modifications to previously approved development orders shall provide assurance that existing landscaping complies with the original development order and Code requirements. 
6.  Additions or renovations to vehicular use areas. Renovations or additions to vehicular use areas shall be governed by Section 7.2.B.12.b.(8) of the Off-street parking and Loading requirements. 
E.  Village Council Conditions. Village Council conditions shall govern project development and site design in the event they exceed this Code. 
F.  Uses no longer regulated as Special Exceptions. All uses approved under Ordinance 3-57 or Ordinance 72-3 shall be required to develop pursuant to the terms of their development order except as provided in this section. Use approved as conditional uses under Ordinance 3-57, as amended, or as special exceptions under Ordinance 73-2, as amended, and which are only subject to Development Review Committee (DRC) use approval shall modify the conditional use or special exception use prior to the issuance of a subsequent development permit by the DRC. All Board imposed conditions shall be carried forward and remain applicable to the subject property, except those that are substandard to this Code. Future modifications to the approved plans shall be made consistent with the procedures and requirements of the Land Development Regulations. 
Sec. 1.5.3. - Existing uses. 
    All uses existing on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto, that preexisted or were permitted pursuant to either Ordinance 3-57, as amended, or Ordinance 73-2, as amended, and have continued pursuant to the standards for nonconforming uses, and which are not permitted in this Code shall be considered nonconforming under the terms of this Code. Uses not legally permitted by this Code or either Ordinance 3-57, as amended, or Ordinance 73-2, as amended, or which did not preexist Ordinance 73-2, shall be considered illegal. 
Sec. 1.5.4. - Invalid approvals. 
    Development orders and permits that are invalid shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this Code. Invalid development orders and permits are projects which have been revoked, have expired or have been found by any Board empowered to enforce this Code to be not in compliance with any conditions of development approval or time certain requirements pursuant to Section 5.8 of this Code, or any amendments hereto. 
CHAPTER 6. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 1.6.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Within the provisions established by this Code, there exist uses of land, structures and lots that were lawfully established before this Code was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to the terms and requirements of this Code. The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses, structures and lots that do not conform to the provisions of this Code or any amendments thereto, and where possible bring the use into conformance with this Code. 
Sec. 1.6.2. - General. 
    It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to continue, but not to allow nonconformities to be enlarged or expanded, except under the limited circumstances established in this article. The provisions of this article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to preserve the integrity of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan. In determining whether a use is nonconforming and will be protected by the provisions of this article, the following shall apply: 
A.  Nonconforming uses status shall not be provided for any use which was illegally commenced, is unlawfully continued, or commenced after the use restrictions become applicable. 
B.  Nonconforming use status shall only be provided where a use is actually commenced not merely contemplated. Further, the use must be continuous during business hours and not an occasional or irregular use of the property. 
C.  An accessory nonconforming use shall not become the principal use. 
D.  Documents shall be provided by the property owner to establish that a use lawfully existed prior to the adoption of applicable use regulation. Affidavits alone are not sufficient evidence to establish nonconforming status. 
CHAPTER 7. - NONCONFORMING USES 
    There are two (2) classes of nonconforming uses; major and minor. Table 1.7-1 shall govern whether a nonconforming uses is major or minor, except that any use in a location nonconforming to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Element shall be deemed a major nonconforming use. A nonconforming use is designated as major when it is established in a zoning district where the use is prohibited and the location is so significantly inappropriate that its location creates or threatens to create incompatibilities potentially injurious to the public welfare. Therefore, strict limits are set forth in this section for the expansion and continuation of major nonconforming uses. A minor nonconforming use is prohibited in the district in which it is located, or is inconsistent with the physical or permit requirements of this Code. Minor nonconforming uses do not create or threaten to create incompatibilities injurious to the public welfare. Therefore, provisions which allow limited expansion of minor nonconforming uses are established. A nonconforming use shall either be a major nonconforming use or minor nonconforming use as identified in Table 1.7-1. 

Sec. 1.7.1. - Major Nonconforming Use. 
A.  Normal maintenance or repair. Normal maintenance or repair of structures where major nonconforming uses are located may be performed in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, as well as repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding twenty (20) percent of the current assessed value of the structure. 
B.  Enlargement or expansion. A major nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied, except a major nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of a structure that was manifestly designed and approved for such use, prior to the date the use became nonconformity. 
C.  Relocation. A structure containing a major nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole, or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless the relocation of the structure containing the major nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity. 
D.  Change in use. A major nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use, unless any new or additional use conforms to the provisions of this Code for the zoning district in which the use is located. A major nonconforming use physically superseded by a permitted use shall not be reestablished. 
E.  Discontinuance or abandonment. If a major nonconforming use is discontinued, abandoned, or becomes an accessory use for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) consecutive years, then such use may not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions specified by this Code. When government action can be documented as a reason for discontinuance or abandonment, the time of delay by government shall not be calculated for the purpose of this section. 
Sec. 1.7.2. - Minor Nonconforming Use. 
A.  Normal maintenance or repair. Normal maintenance or repair of structures where minor nonconforming uses are located may be performed in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, as well as repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding thirty (30) percent of the current assessed value of the structure. 
B.  Enlargement or expansion. A minor nonconforming use may be enlarged or expanded as follows: 
1.  A minor nonconforming use prohibited in the district in which it is located may expand on one (1) occasion, through the administrative variance process as established in Sec. 5.7.G. The administrative variance shall be permitted provided that the enlargement or expansion complies with Art. 11, Adequate Public Facilities Standards, would not exceed ten (10) percent of the floor area of that individual structure or ten (10) percent of the original assessed value of the structure on site, whichever is less. 
2.  A minor nonconforming use that is not in compliance with this Code's physical requirements, such as landscaping, locational criteria or parking regulations, or this Code's permit requirements, such as possessing a required development order for conditional use, may expand on one (1) occasion, pursuant to Development Review Committee review. Based on the standards set forth in this section, the DRC shall deny, approve or approve with conditions the request for expansion pursuant to the process established in Article 5 of this Code. 
The request shall be permitted provided all of the following apply: 
a.  The enlargement or expansion would not exceed ten (10) percent of the floor area of the structure or appraised value of the structures on site, whichever is less; 
b.  The expansion does not create any additional nonconformities; 
c.  The use and expansion are in compliance with Article 11, Adequate Public Facilities Standards; 
d.  The use and expansion complies with Environmental Control Rules I and II; 
e.  The use and the expansion will result in a reduction of nonconforming features to the greatest extent practicable; 
f.  The use and the expansion will comply with the landscape, vegetation preservation and protection, and lighting provisions of this Code; and, 
g.  The use and the expansion will comply with Article 15, Traffic Performance Standards. 
C.  Relocation. A structure containing a minor nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole, or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless the relocation on the structure containing the minor nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity. 
D.  Change in use. A minor nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use, unless any new or additional use conforms to the provisions of this Code for the zoning district in which the use is located. A minor nonconforming use that is physically superseded by a permitted use shall not be reestablished. 
E.  Discontinuance or abandonment. If a minor nonconforming use is discontinued, abandoned, or becomes an accessory use for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) consecutive years, then such use may not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions specified by this Code. When government action can be documented as the reason for discontinuance or abandonment, the time of delay by government shall not be calculated for the purpose of this section.

Note: 
  Regardless of zoning district, whether a use is a major nonconforming or a minor nonconforming use is determined by the specific land use in a zoning district. 
  "A" constitutes a Major Nonconforming Use. 
  "B" constitutes a Minor Nonconforming Use. 
CHAPTER 8. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES 
    A nonconforming structure devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, may be continued in accordance with the provisions in this section. 

Sec. 1.8.1. - Normal maintenance. 
    Normal maintenance or repair to permit continuation of a nonconforming structure may be performed in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, as well as repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding twenty (20) percent of the current assessed value of the structure. 
Sec. 1.8.2. - Enlargement or expansion. 
    A nonconforming structure may be enlarged or expanded if the enlargement or expansion meets the requirements of this Code (except the dimensional lot area requirements of the zoning district in which it is located), as long as the enlargement or expansion does not change or increase the nonconformity, or add structures or uses prohibited in the zoning district. 
Sec. 1.8.3. - Relocation. 
    A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless it conforms to the standards and requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
Sec. 1.8.4. - Damage and restoration of nonconforming structure. 
A.  A nonconforming structure that is reconstructed, destroyed or rebuilt by any means to an extent of more than thirty (30) percent of its value at the time of reconstruction, or destruction, shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Code. This subsection shall apply to the cumulative changes in value as a nonconforming structure is redeveloped and improved over the previous seven (7) years. 
B.  The value of the nonconforming structure shall be determined by taking one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the most recent assessed value of the nonconforming structure, as determined by reference to the records of the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser. 
C.  In determining whether the value of the improvement exceeds thirty (30) percent of the property's value, the "aggregate cost approach" as outlined in the most current building valuation data published by the Southern Building Code Congress International in the periodical 'Southern Building,' or other comparable guidelines adopted in law or accepted in practice by the Building Director, shall be used as the sole basis for calculation. 
D.  Should a nonconforming structure be reconstructed, destroyed and rebuilt by any means to an extent less than thirty (30) percent but more than twenty (20) percent of its assessed value, it may be restored only upon application to the Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board as a variance request pursuant to the terms in Sec. 5.7. 
E.  To establish its jurisdiction over the variance request, the Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board shall determine whether the valuation falls within the parameters established in this subsection. If it does, the Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board shall determine whether the nonconforming structure can function adequately without meeting the Code requirements that render it a nonconforming structure. 
F.  In making its determination, the Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board shall be guided by the following standards: 
1.  The degree of nonconformity of the structure; 
2.  If the nonconformity will continue. Whether the relationships among the various design elements of the lot, parcel or structure (such as parking, landscaping, vehicular circulation, or access points) are adequate to meet minimum health and safety standards; 
3.  Whether continuation of the nonconforming structure will create or contribute to a health and safety hazard in or adjacent to the nonconforming structure; and 
4.  Whether the nonconforming structure can be reduced in intensity or redesigned to mitigate the effects of the nonconformity. 
Sec. 1.8.5. - Unsafe structure. 
    Any portion of a nonconforming structure which becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and which is declared unsafe or unlawful by a duly authorized Village official, but which an owner wishes to restore, repair, or rebuild, shall be restored, repaired, or rebuilt in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
CHAPTER 9. - NONCONFORMING LOTS 

Sec. 1.9.1. - Residential development. 
    A single-family dwelling and customary accessory uses may be developed on a single lot, if all of the following conditions are met: 
A.  Development permissible prior to creation of nonconformity. Development of a single family dwelling and customary accessory uses were permissible under the applicable Code at the time the single lot was created. 
B.  Record of creation. The single lot was: 
1.  Of record or was the subject of a recorded agreement for deed or other recorded instrument of conveyance prior to January 23, 1973. Lots created by conveyance after this date shall be reviewed by the Village Engineer for compliance with Art. 8, Subdivision, Platting and Required Improvements; or 
2.  Shown on a recorded map, plat, drawing or survey prior to the adoption of this Code; or 
3.  Determined to be a lot within an antiquated subdivision as determined by the Comprehensive Plan; and 
4.  Not subject to the lot recombination requirements of Art. 8., Subdivision, Platting and Required Improvements, or the Comprehensive Plan. 
5.  Legally subdivided prior to the adoption of this Code. 
C.  Property development regulations. The proposed use is permitted and the single lot meets the minimum property development regulations that are generally applicable in the zoning district in which it is located, except for the minimum lot area and dimensions, minimum yard setback requirements, maximum lot coverage and maximum total floor area. If the single lot, tract or parcel of land does not meet the setback and lot coverage regulations of the current underlying zoning district, the following minimum yard setback, and maximum lot coverage requirements may be applied, for the specific lot characteristics which are nonconforming, in lieu of the district property development regulations. 
1.  Minimum Yard Setback Requirements 1 . 
Front 30% of depth Side (corner) 20% of width Side (interior) 15% of width Rear 20% of depth  
1 Lots one and one-half (11/2) acre or smaller, that cannot accommodate current setbacks or a percentage setback for a particular yard, may apply a minimum twenty-five (25) foot setback. 
2.  Maximum Lot Coverage: 40% of total lot area. 
Sec. 1.9.2. - Non-residential development. 
    Non-residential development and customary accessory uses may be developed on a single lot if all of the following conditions are met: 
A.  Development permissible prior to creation of nonconformity. Development of the non-residential development and customary accessory uses were permissible under the applicable Code at the time the single lot was created. 
B.  Record of creation. The single lot was: 
1.  Of record or was the subject of an agreement for deed which was recorded or proof of agreement is furnished, or other recorded instrument of conveyance prior to January 23, 1973. Lots created by conveyance after this date shall be reviewed by the Village Engineer for compliance with Art. 8, Subdivision, Platting and Required Improvements; or 
2.  Shown on a recorded map, plat, drawing or survey prior to the adoption of this Code; or 
3.  Determined to be a lot within an antiquated subdivision as determined by the Comprehensive Plan; and 
4.  Not subject to the lot recombination requirements of Art. 8., Subdivision, Platting and Required Improvements. 
5.  Legally subdivided prior to the adoption of this Code. 
C.  Property development regulations. The proposed use is permissible under this code and all supplementary development regulations for the use, including but not limited to minimum lot areas or additional setbacks or the proposed use obtains a variance pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 5.7. 
Sec. 1.9.3. - Zoning district amendment on lots of record. 
    When amending the zoning district designation of a portion of a single lot of record, that portion proposed for amendment shall be subject to the density or intensity requirements of the Comprehensive Plan. 
CHAPTER 10. - PROPERTIES AFFECTED BY EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEEDINGS 

Sec. 1.10.1. - Applicability. 
    This section of the Code shall apply to all properties impacted by an eminent domain action. Site improvements and conditions, including nonconforming features, existing prior to the time of the eminent domain action shall not be affected this section. Nonconforming uses shall not be affected by this section. The provisions of this section shall not alone cause a specific use on a property impacted by an eminent domain action to cease. 
    For the purposes of this ordinance, an "eminent domain action" occurs when property is acquired through an eminent domain proceeding or where such property is voluntarily conveyed under the threat of condemnation to a condemning authority. 
Sec. 1.10.2. - Properties Affected by Eminent Domain Action. 
    Properties, and site improvements developed thereupon, impacted by eminent domain action may continue to exist and may expand as outlined below. 
A.  General. Where, due to an eminent domain action, a reduction in the size of a lot causes a reduction below the required lot area, setbacks, parking, landscaping, sign location or other development regulations in this Code, the structure(s) on the property, the use(s) within the structure(s) and other site improvements may continue to exist in the configuration remaining after the condemnation, except that: 
1.  Accessways. The length of accessways shall not be less than ten (10) feet measured from the right-of-way line, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Village Engineer based on accepted traffic engineering principles; and 
2.  Direction. Ingress and egress to the site shall be in a forward direction. Where parking is reduced, the use of off-site parking, cross parking agreements and shared parking agreements are encouraged. 
B.  Enlargement or change in use. A structure or other site improvement located on property reduced by an eminent domain action may be enlarged or expanded if the enlarged or expanded portion meets the requirements of this Code. Changes in use are allowed if permitted by the applicable zoning district. Additional parking is required only for the increase in parking required by the enlargement or change in use. The required parking for the new use shall be calculated by subtracting the number of required spaces for the new use (less any excess spaces existing at the time of the eminent domain action, if any) from parking requirement for the most current use. For the purpose of determining the required parking, the code in effect at the time of the enlargement or change in use shall be used. There shall be no reduction in required spaces designated for physically disabled persons. 
C.  Redesign of Sites. Redesign of sites, at any time, is encouraged for the purposes of achieving safer sites and enhanced landscaping along roadways. Toward this end, site improvements may be relocated or replaced elsewhere on site and shall be approved provided the redesign meets code requirements, except as modified in this section. Redesign shall follow the permitting procedures of this code, except for provisions noted below which are intended to provide additional flexibility. 
1.  Variance required for new deviation from regulations. A variance shall be obtained for any additional deviation from required property development regulations or site design standards proposed by the redesign. Any redesign or expansion which reduces an existing deviation from required property development regulations or site design standards does not require a variance. For the purposes for applying the variance standards in Sec. 5.8 of this code, the eminent domain action shall be presumed to be sufficient evidence to demonstrate hardship for variances resulting from the eminent domain action. 
2.  Amendment of Village Council approved site plans. Where a proposed redesign is located on property which is the subject of a site plan approved by the Village Council, redesign shall be approved by the Development Review Committee even if the redesign proposes site plan changes in excess of the administrative limits contained in Secs. 5.4.5.M.and 5.4.6.M, of this Code, provided it meets code or the provisions of this section. Conditions imposed by the Village Council shall not be amended without Village Council approval. 
3.  Variance and DRC approval not required. To encourage site redesign, in cases when Development Review Committee site plan approval and a variance would both be required, only a variance shall be required. 
4.  Parking area reduction. If site redesign involves either a lot combination, vehicular use area or other alteration required by subsection 1.10.2.1 (Accessways), a reduction of up to thirty-five (35%) percent of the required spaces shall be permitted by right provided: 
a.  The access standards of Secs. 7.7 and 7.2.3.M of this code are met; and 
b.  A landscape buffer strip a minimum of five (5) feet wide with landscaping is installed along the frontage of the property. 
D.  Damage or restoration of structures. A structure subject to this section which becomes damaged may be reconstructed in the location and manner as it legally existed after the eminent domain action except that a structure that is destroyed or damaged in excess of more than fifty (50) percent of its value at the time of reconstruction shall be considered a vacant lot pursuant to Sec. B.6, below. In determining the value of such a structure, the standards and procedures described in Sec. 1.8.4 of this code shall be used. 
E.  Signs. Any existing legally established point of purchase or free standing sign that is located within the property included in the eminent domain action may be relocated on site subject to the standards of this Section of the Code and the following criteria: 
1.  Sign number and size. Any sign(s) to be relocated shall comply with the height, size (face area) and maximum number of signs allowed requirements of the Code. 
2.  Sign relocation. In no event shall the front setback be less than five (5) feet from the ultimate right-of-way and have less than a two (2) feet side setback, except upon receipt of a sign relocation permit. 
3.  Sign relocation permit. Signs that must be relocated which are physically precluded from compliance with the setback requirement in subsection 1.10.2.5.2, above, may obtain, upon payment of a fee, a sign relocation certificate from the Planning & Zoning Director subject to this subsection. The Planning & Zoning Director shall issue a sign relocation certificate provided the applicant can meet the following standards: 
a.  The sign relocation in accordance with subsection 1.10.2.5.2, above, would create additional loss in the number of required parking; 
b.  The proposed sign location does not encroach into the right-of-way, unless it is part of a negotiated settlement with the condemning authority; and 
c.  There is no other location on the subject property to place the sign consistent with safe vehicular use area design. 
F.  Vacant lots. A vacant lot reduced by an eminent domain action to any size or configuration below the required district lot size, frontage, depth or width specified in Sec. 6.5, property development regulations, may be developed. Uses subject to special lot size requirements of Sec. 6.4, supplemental regulations, shall be required to comply with those standards. In all cases, required district setbacks shall be used. 
G.  Lot combination. This subsection is intended to encourage the combining of lots for the purposes of creating safer, more functional and aesthetically pleasing developments and attaining a greater degree of compliance with code requirements. This subsection may apply to the combined lots whether or not they are owned by the same person. 
Combined lots may be developed as a single lot for the purposes of applying property development regulations provided either a cross parking or cross access agreement is executed. The agreement shall be made in the form acceptable to the Village Attorney and recorded in the official records of Palm Beach County, Florida. 
Lot combination shall follow the permitting requirements and procedures of this code, except as clarified or provided for below: 
1.  Parking credit. Except as provided below (razed lots), required parking for combined lots may be administratively reduced by up to twenty (20) percent upon approval by the Planning & Zoning Director of a site plan which reduces points of access and the execution of a unity of control which includes a cross parking or cross access agreement. 
2.  Razed sites. Lots which have been combined and where the principal structures have been demolished shall be considered to be a vacant lot pursuant to Sec. 1.10.2.F above. 
3.  Sites subject to approved site plans or Certificates of Conformity. For properties which are the subject of a valid Certificate of Conformity, the Certificate may be amended, upon application by the property owner and approval of the Development Review Committee, to allow the combination and the configuration shown on the Certificate may be implemented. Where a proposed lot combination is located on property which is the subject of a site plan approved by the Village Council, combination may be approved by the Development Review Committee even if the redesign proposes site plan changes in excess of the administrative limits contained in Secs. 5.4.5.M.and 5.4.6.M, of this Code. Conditions imposed by the Village Council shall not be amended without Village Council approval. 
Sec. 1.10.3. - Certificates of Conformity. 
    A Certificate of Conformity issued pursuant to either Ordinance 73-2, as amended, or Ordinance 92-20, as amended through June 1993, shall be honored provided the Certificate of Conformity has been issued to the property owner or a notice of intent to issue a certificate of conformity has been signed by the property owner before June 30, 1994. The site configurations depicted in these Certificates of Conformity shall be considered valid pursuant to Sec. 1.5 of this Code and may be implemented or amended by the Development Review Committee. All other Certificates of Conformity, including Notices of Intent to Issue a Certificate of Conformity, shall become null and void. 
[Ord. No. 2004-11; July 13, 2004; Sec. 1.10.2.3.4] 
CHAPTER 11. - CREATION OF POTENTIALLY BUILDABLE RESIDENTIAL SINGLE FAMILY LOTS 

Sec. 1.11.1. - Applicability. 
    The following provisions shall apply to the development of any lot which is not depicted on either a plat of record, affidavit of exemption, or affidavit of plat waiver, currently valid and in effect for the subject project. 
Sec. 1.11.2. - Determination Criteria. 
    A residential single family lot, as originally conveyed, may be considered eligible for building permits if determined that the lot complies with the following criteria: 
A.  Legal Recordation of lot. The single family lot was conveyed into ownership separate from abutting lands pursuant to a recorded deed, recorded agreement for deed or other recorded instrument of conveyance after February 2, 1973 and prior to June 16, 1992 and has not been reconvened, in whole or in part, into common ownership with an abutting property. 
B.  Density criteria. The lot created by conveyance pursuant to Section 1.11.2.A complied with the density requirements of the Comprehensive Plan in effect at the time the lot was created. 
The 1972 Land Use Plan (now termed Comprehensive Plan) was effective from December 6, 1972 through August 1, 1980. The 1980 Comprehensive Plan was effective from August 1. 1980 to August 31, 1989. The 1989 Comprehensive Plan was effective August 31, 1989 and is still in effect. 
C.  Zoning requirements. The lot complies with all other development standards of the zoning regulations adopted June 16, 1992. A variance shall not be permitted to reduce the lot size to qualify to meet the requirements of this subsection. 
D.  Legal Access. The lot has legal access, established at the time the lot was recorded, in compliance with the following: 
1.  The street classifications found in Chart 8.22-2 (Chart of minor streets); or 
2.  A recorded express casement, a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width, granting the owner, its successors and assigns a perpetual right of useable access across all properties lying between said lot and a street. 
Sec. 1.11.3. - Determination of compliance. 
    Prior to the submittal of a building permit application, the property owner shall submit, on forms established by the Planning & Zoning Director, a request for a determination that the lot is in compliance with this subsection. The Planning & Zoning Director shall make a determination within ten (10) days. 
Sec. 1.11.4. - Recordation of a potentially buildable lot. 
    After issuance of a determination of compliance, but prior to the submittal of a building permit, the property owner shall record a Potentially Buildable Lot Affidavit, survey, and legal description of the lot with the Clerk of the Court, in a form established by the Planning & Zoning Director. 
Sec. 1.11.5. - Issuance of a building permit. 
    If a Buildable Lot Affidavit is recorded in accordance with the standards and procedures herein and the lot and proposed residence comply with zoning requirements, drainage requirements, environmental control rules and all other permitting requirements, a building permit may be issued.

Sec. 5.3.11. - Reasonable accommodation. 
    Sec. 5.3.11.1. Purpose and general provisions. 
A.  This chapter addresses requests for reasonable accommodation to the Villages ordinances, rules, policies, and procedures for persons with disabilities and facilities serving them as provided by the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (42 U.S.C. 3601, et seq.) ("FHA") and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12131 et seq.) ("ADA"). 
B.  The following general provisions shall be applicable: 
1.  The Village shall display a notice in the Village's public notice bulletin board (and shall maintain copies available for review in the Village clerk's office advising the public disabled individuals (and qualifying entities) may request reasonable accommodation as provided herein. 
2.  A disabled individual may apply for a reasonable accommodation on his/her own behalf or may be represented at all stages of the reasonable accommodation process by a person designated in writing by the disabled individual. 
3.  The Village shall provide assistance and accommodation as is required pursuant to FHA and ADA in connection with a disabled person's request for reasonable accommodation, including, without limitation, assistance with reading application questions, responding to questions, completing the necessary forms, filing an appeal, and appearing at a hearing to ensure the process is accessible. 
    Sec. 5.3.11.2. Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, a "disabled" individual or person is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person who is disabled (or qualifying entities) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the Village's land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures as provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this chapter. 
    Sec. 5.3.11.3. Procedure. 
A.  A request by an applicant for reasonable accommodation shall be made in writing by completion of a reasonable accommodation request form. The form shall be maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the Planning, Zoning and Building Department. 
B.  The PZB Director, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation. The PZB Director, or designee, shall issue a written determination within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date of receipt of a completed application and may, in accordance with federal law: 
1.  Grant the accommodation request; 
2.  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request; or 
3.  Deny the request, in accordance with federal law. 
Any such denial shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal. The notice of determination shall be sent to the requesting party (i.e. the disabled individual or his/her representative) by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice shall be deemed complete when deposited in the U.S. Mail. If reasonably necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, PZB Director, or designee, may, prior to the end of said 45-day period, request additional information from the requesting party, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. The requesting party shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of the request for additional information to provide the requested information. In the event a request for additional information is made, the 45-day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the PZB Director, or designee, shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the additional information. If the requesting party fails to provide the requested additional information within said 15-day period, the Planning Director, or designee, shall issue a written notice advising that the requesting party has failed to timely submit the additional information, and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the Village with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
C.  In determining whether the reasonable accommodation request shall be granted or denied, the requesting party shall be required to establish that they are protected under the FHA and/or ADA by demonstrating that they are handicapped or disabled, as defined in the FHA and/or ADA. Although the definition of disability is subject to judicial interpretation, for purposes of this section the disabled individual must show: 
1.  A physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one (1) or more major life activities; and 
2.  A record of having such impairment; or 
3.  That they are regarded as having such impairment. 
The requesting party will have to further demonstrate that the proposed accommodations being sought are reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped/disabled persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy the subject property. The foregoing (as interpreted by the courts) shall be the basis for a decision upon a reasonable accommodation request made by the PZB Director, or designee, or by the Village Manager in the event of an appeal. 
D.  While an application for reasonable accommodation, or appeal of a determination of same, is pending before the Village, the Village will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the applicant. 
    Sec. 5.3.11.4. Appeal. 
A.  The requesting party may appeal the decision of the PZB Director or his/her designee. The appeal shall be submitted in writing no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the decision of the PZB Director or his/her designee. All appeals shall include a statement containing sufficient detail of the grounds for the appeal. Appeals shall be to the Village Manager who shall render a determination as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days after an appeal has been filed. 
    Sec. 5.3.11.5. Fee. 
    There shall be no fee imposed by the Village in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation under this section or an appeal of a determination, and the Village shall have no obligation to pay a requesting party's (or an appealing party's, as applicable) attorneys' fees or costs in connection with a request or an appeal.

(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 2, 5-25-2010; Ord. No. 2013-03, §§ 2, 3(Att. B), 5-14-2013) 
Sec. 6.4.4. - Supplementary use standards. 
    This section contains supplementary standards for specific uses. In the case of conflict with district or other regulations of this Code, the more restrictive requirement shall apply, unless otherwise specifically provided or clearly intended. Where a variance from these standards is required to allow the use on site, such as a minimum lot size requirement, or meet a minimum required standard such as parking, the variance shall be obtained before the use application is placed on the agenda for Development Review Committee. Where a variance from these standards is requested to facilitate a desired site design and is not required to allow the use, the variance may be obtained at any time prior to certification of the final site or subdivision plan. 
1.  Accessory dwelling means a second dwelling unit either in or added to an existing single-family dwelling, or in an accessory structure on the same lot as the principal single-family dwelling. An accessory dwelling is a complete, independent living facility equipped with a kitchen and with provisions for sanitation and sleeping. An accessory dwelling use shall comply with the following supplementary use standards: 
a.  Approval. Applicant shall obtain a special permit from the Zoning Division. 
b.  Occupancy. Occupancy of accessory dwelling shall be limited to a household that includes at least one (1) member who is physically disabled or elderly, or who meets the low-income standards specified in affordable housing as defined in Article 3. 
c.  Number of units. A maximum of one (1) dwelling may be permitted as an accessory use to a principal single-family dwelling unit. The accessory dwelling may be attached to the principal dwelling unit or may be freestanding. 
d.  Floor area. The accessory dwelling shall not exceed eight hundred (800) square feet gross floor area, except when located on a lot that is at least one (1) acre in size, in which case the dwelling shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area. An administrative variance of up to ten (10) percent of the gross floor area of the accessory dwelling may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Director providing that all other zoning district and sub area regulations are met. 
e.  Number of bedrooms. No accessory dwelling shall contain more than one (1) bedroom. 
f.  Architecture. The accessory dwelling shall be constructed of materials substantially equivalent to either the principal dwelling unit or other permanent accessory structure on the lot, provided that such materials comply with all other applicable standards of the building code. 
g.  Compatibility. The accessory dwelling shall be compatible in character and subordinate in size to the principal dwelling unit. 
h.  Setbacks. The accessory dwelling shall comply with the minimum yard setbacks applicable to the principal single-family dwelling unit. 
i.  No separate ownership. The accessory dwelling shall remain accessory to and under the same ownership as the principal single-family dwelling unit, and shall not be subdivided or sold as a condominium. 
j.  Renewal of special permit. The special permit shall be renewed annually in accordance with Section 5.5.5.I. of this Code. 
2.  Adult entertainment. 
a.  Establishment. Any adult arcade, adult theater, adult bookstore/adult video store, adult motel, or adult dancing establishment; or any establishment or business operated for commercial gain where any employee, operator or owner exposes his/her specified anatomical area for viewing by patrons, including but not limited to: massage establishments whether or not licensed pursuant to Chapter 480, Fla. Stat., tanning salon, modeling studio, or lingerie studio 
b.  Exclusions. Excluded from this definition are any educational institutions where the exposure of the specified anatomical area is associated with a curriculum or program. 
c.  License. An establishment that possesses an adult entertainment license is presumed to be an adult entertainment establishment. 
An adult entertainment use shall comply with the following supplementary use standards: A special permit for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued or denied within twenty-one (21) days of a determination of application sufficiency pursuant to the standards and procedures in Article 5 and the requirements of the Code. An aggrieved party has the right to immediately appeal a denial of application sufficiency for a special permit, denial of a special permit, or revocation or suspension of a permit by the filing of a petition for Writ of Certiorari in the Circuit Court in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida in accordance with the procedure and within the time provided by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
i.  Purpose and intent. This section is intended to provide for the proper location of adult entertainment uses in order to protect the integrity of adjacent neighborhoods, educational uses, religious uses, parks and other commercial uses. Proper separation of adult entertainment uses prevents the creation of "skid-row" areas in The Village that results from the concentration of these uses and their patrons. It is the intent of this section to limit the secondary effects of adult entertainment uses. The standards in this section are intended to ensure that residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other commercial uses we located in areas free from the secondary effects of adult entertainment uses. The location of residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other commercial uses within viable, unblighted and desirable areas supports the preservation of property values and promotes the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
ii.  Specified anatomical areas means: 
(a)  Less than completely and opaquely covered: 
(i.)  Human genitals and pubic region; or 
(ii.)  The opening between the human buttocks, i.e., the anal cleft; or 
(iii.)  That portion of the human female breast encompassed within an area falling below the horizontal line one would have to draw to intersect a point immediately above the top of the areola (the colored ring around the nipple); this definition shall include the entire lower portion of the female breast, but shall not include any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, shirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel, provided the areola is not so exposed; or 
(iv.)  Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered. 
(b)  Specified sexual activities means: 
(i.)  Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulations, arousal or tumescence; 
(ii.)  Acts of human analingus, bestiality, buggery, cunnilingus, coprophagy, coprophilia, fellation, flagellation, masochism, masturbation, necrophilia, pederasty, pedophilia, sadism, sadomasochism, sexual intercourse, or sodomy; or 
(iii.)  Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttock, anus, or female breast; or 
(iv.)  Excretory functions as part of or in connection with any of the activities set forth in subsections 1. through 2. 
iii.  Findings of fact. Based on the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearings before the Village Council and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986). "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, City of Indianapolis, January, 1984, the Village Council hereby finds the following: 
(a)  Commercial uses exist or may exist within The Village where books, magazines, motion pictures, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties and/or other devices that depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(b)  Commercial uses exist or may exist within The Village: 
(c)  Where the superficial tissues of one person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, and/or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified anatomical areas; 
(d)  Where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for any form of commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing any specified anatomical area; or 
(e)  Where lap dancing occurs. 
(f)  This competitive commercial exploitation of such nudity and semi-nudity is adverse to the public's interest and the quality of life, tone of commerce, and the community environment in The Village. 
(g)  When the activities described in Section 6.0.2.c.(1) and 6.0.2.c.(2) above are presented in commercial uses, other activities that are illegal, immoral, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and land. 
(h)  When the activities described in Section 6.0.2.c.(1) and 6.0.2.c.(2) above are present in commercial uses within The Village, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower property values, promote crime, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(i)  There is a direct relationship between the display or depiction of specified anatomical areas as described in Section 6.0.2.c.(2) above and an increase in criminal activities, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the occurrence of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining land and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the public's interest and quality of life, the tone of commerce and the community environment in The Village. 
(j)  Based upon these findings, it is in the interest of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of The Village that adult entertainment uses are regulated pursuant to the following standards: 
iv.  Nonconformity. 
(a)  Establishment of Nonconformity. Any adult entertainment use shall be deemed a nonconforming use and the standards of this section shall not apply if the adult entertainment use on November 28, 1988:

(c)  Occupational license. Possessed a valid and current occupational license authorizing the general type of use which would correspond to the adult entertainment use being claimed as nonconforming on November 28, 1988; 
(d)  Adult entertainment license. Any establishment seeking to establish nonconforming status as an adult entertainment use under the terms of this Code, shall submit an application for an adult entertainment license pursuant to the Village Adult Entertainment Code. 
(e)  Standards for nonconformance. A nonconforming adult entertainment use as determined in Section 6.4.4.B.4 above shall be subject to the following supplementary standards, in addition to Art. 1.6 (Nonconformities). 
(i.)  Location. The adult entertainment use located within the distances set forth in. Section 6.4.4.B.4 shall not increase the gross floor area or square footage of the structure by more than ten (10) percent over a fifteen-year period, beginning November 28, 1988.

For the purpose of measuring the distance between adult entertainment uses, the distance shall be measured by drawing a straight line between the nearest point on the perimeter of the exterior wall or bay of the proposed or existing adult entertainment establishment and the nearest point on the exterior wall or bay of another adult entertainment establishment. Measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects. 
(c)  No variance. There shall be no variance to the locational standards of this section. 
(d)  Subsequent development within locational standards. The subsequent approval of a development order for a church or place of worship, elementary or secondary school, public park or residential district within the distances outlined in this section shall not change the status of the adult entertainment use to that of a nonconforming use. 
vi.  Screening. A landscape buffer strip shall be installed along any property line that abuts a residential district. 
vii.  Lighting. Outdoor low-intensity lighting shall be provided that illuminates the entire parking and vehicular use area. The lighting shall be installed on structures that do not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height from finished grade.

*Notes: 
(1)  Minimum lot sizes for the RM and RH districts are governed by the density indicated by the Comprehensive Plan, and compliance with property development regulations and design standards including, but not limited to: building setbacks, parking requirements, landscaping requirements, and building coverages. Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan dictates that proposed site plans and subdivisions are governed by the permitted density of the applicable land-use category; a lot size which achieves this consistency, and complies with all relevant property development regulations and design standards, is therefore, acceptable minimum lot size. 
(2)  All principal buildings and uses require address signs pursuant to Section 7.14.4 of this Code. 
(3)  Certain nonconforming lots may use the setback provisions in Section 1.9 of this Code. 
(4)  Residential side interior and rear setbacks abutting open space may be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent. (See Section 6.5.7.F)

I.  Design Standards for Commercial and Industrial Projects over 15,000 square feet in size or larger and Prohibition of Free-Standing Retail Buildings over 75,000 square feet in size or larger: 
1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide additional design standards and guidelines for commercial and industrial projects fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in size or larger to supplement existing development standards with specific additional regulations that apply to the design of these very large-fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet (or larger) buildings and also to groupings of structures which, in combined total, meet the fifteen thousand (15,000) square-foot threshold required for applicability of this section to such projects and to prohibit free-standing retail buildings over seventy-five thousand (75,000) square feet in size or larger. The design of commercial and industrial building(s) and projects determines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscape and character of a community. Massive and/or generic developments that do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place. The goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and strong community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design treatments which will enhance the visual appearance of commercial and industrial development in the Village of Wellington, while still providing for design flexibility in accordance with the goals, policies and objectives of the Village of Wellington Comprehensive Plan and the purpose and intent of this Code. These regulations are also intended to promote the use of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (C.P.T.E.D.) principles including: 
 Visibility-Visibility for law enforcement and other people in the area; 
 Natural surveillance-Placing areas of activity where they can be seen by law enforcement and the public; and 
 Defensible space-Designing areas which people will take as their own and not be willing to relinquish this space to other undesirable activities. 
2.  Applicability. Provisions of this division are applicable for all new construction in all Village commercial and industrial zoning districts as well as for commercial components of PUD's and developments of regional impact (DRI's) which meet the size criteria; additionally, these provisions are applicable for existing structures meeting the size criteria as provided below: 
a.  Renovations and redevelopment: In the case of additions, renovations or redevelopment of an existing building or project where the cost of such addition, renovation or redevelopment exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the existing structure(s), or twenty (20) percent of the square footage of the existing structure, the provisions of this section shall apply. 
b.  Discontinuance: Where the use of a structure ceases for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days for any reason, except where governmental action impedes access to the premises or has otherwise caused the cessation of the use, the provisions of this section which may require structural alterations shall be adhered to prior to the use of the structure. With respect to vehicular use and required landscape areas, the provisions of this section shall apply where the use of a structure ceases for any reason, except where governmental action impedes access to the premises or has otherwise caused the cessation of the use, for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days. 
c.  Required site development or improvement plan: Compliance with the standards set forth in this division shall be demonstrated by submittal of architectural drawings and a site development plan or site improvement plan in accordance with Article 5 of this Code. 
3.  Limitations on Size of Retail Building. 
a.  No free-standing retail building, utilized by a single tenant, shall exceed seventy-five thousand (75,000) square feet of gross floor area. 
b.  Retail building shall mean a retail establishment (store) with any commercial retail uses or a combination of such commercial retail which includes gross floor area and ancillary outdoor storage or merchandise display areas. The floor area does not include motor vehicle parking or loading areas. For the purpose of determining the applicability of the seventy-five thousand (75,000) square foot of floor area, the aggregate square footage of all adjacent stores which share common check stands, management, a controlling ownership interest, and storage areas, shall be considered one establishment, e.g. a plant nursery associated with a general merchandise area such as a home improvement area. 
c.  In buildings larger than seventy-five thousand (75,000) square feet, no single tenant may occupy more than fifty (50) percent of the structure.

CHAPTER 8. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 6.8.1. - General. 
    The following provisions are applicable to all Planned Development Districts. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The application of flexible land use regulations to the development of land is often difficult or impossible within traditional zoning district standards. In order to permit the use of more flexible land use regulations and to facilitate use of the most advantageous techniques of land development, it is often necessary to establish a Planned Development District designation in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan. The objective of a Planned Development District is to encourage ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners and developers, to produce development that is in keeping with overall land use intensity and open space objectives of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan, while departing from the strict application of the dimensional standards of traditional Districts. Planned Development Districts are intended to allow design flexibility and provide performance standards that: 
1.  Ensure that future growth and development occurs in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  Minimize adverse impacts of development on the environment by preserving native vegetation, wetlands and protected animal species to the greatest extent possible;

e.  Property development regulation. Previously approved planned developments shall be governed by the development regulations of this section, the regulations within Village Council conditions, and the regulations indicated on the latest certified master plan or site plan as allowed in Section 1.5. 
C.  Residential Density and Comprehensive Plan Land Uses Categories . The residential densities and corresponding Comprehensive Plan land use categories for planned developments districts and previously approved planned developments shall be determined by the following: 
1.  Table 6.8-1. Table 6.8-1, Planned Development District Densities and Corresponding Land Use Categories, indicates the minimum density, the standard density, and the planned development density, and the Comprehensive Plan land use categories which correspond to the various Planned Development Districts. 
a.  Computation of density. The residential density for planned developments shall be based on gross site acreage. 
b.  Minimum development density. The minimum residential density required by the Comprehensive Plan for a particular land use category. 
c.  Standard development density. Standard development density is defined as the maximum density allowed without a planned development for a land use category. A planned development which meets the minimum performance standards of the Comprehensive Plan, the minimum standards of Section 6.8.1 Planned Development District Regulations, and the minimum standards of the applicable Planned Development District, shall receive a standard density allocation as indicated on the Land Use Atlas. 
d.  Planned development density. A planned development may qualify for a density bonus, in addition to the standard density, by meeting and exceeding the following standards: 
i.  The performance and density standards of the Land Use Element of the Village Comprehensive Plan shall be met for the total density to be permitted; and, 
ii.  The Planned Development District shall be consistent with and exceed the requirements of Section 6.8, Planned Development District Regulations including but not limited to the design criteria, vegetation preservation, transportation program and recreation requirements of the applicable Planned Development District. 
The density bonus shall not be considered an entitlement for the use of a Planned Development District, and shall only be granted for exemplary projects that exceed the minimum requirements of this section. The Village Council has the option of granting standard density, a partial planned development density bonus, or the maximum planned development density bonus. 
e.  Affordable housing. In addition to the standard density and the planned development density, a Planned Development District may qualify for an affordable housing bonus pursuant to Section 6.10, Voluntary Density Bonus, or other Comprehensive Plan affordable housing programs.

TABLE 6.8-1, NOTES: 
This chart indicates the Comprehensive Plan land use categories which correspond to Planned Development Districts. For previously approved planned developments, the Planning & Zoning Director shall use the land use category which most closely reflects the existing Zoning district and development order. For example, a development previously approved as a planned office business park in the CHO zoning district most closely corresponds to the CHO land use category. A complete listing of land use categories available in unincorporated The Village is located within the Comprehensive Plan. 
Actual maximum density granted to a Planned Development is based upon meeting performance goals and Comprehensive Plan objectives. Actual density granted by the Village Council to a Planned Development may be less than the maximum density indicated. 
Gross densities above eight (8) dwelling units per acre (based on entire area of a Planned Development) shall be limited to affordable housing programs included in the Village Comprehensive Plan and may apply for property development regulations for density bonus programs. 
Densities indicated in Table 6.8-1 shall be calculated based upon the gross area of a Planned Development. 
Maximum density for a Traditional Neighborhood District (TND) is calculated by adding the maximum underlying density of a residential land use category to the maximum density bonus available, up to two (2) dwelling units per acre, granted through the rezoning process. 
Residential density for a MXPD shall be determined by the underlying residential land use category of the commercial or industrial land use category indicated on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Atlas. Land with a commercial or industrial land use designation without an underlying residential land use category shall be assigned a residential density by PZB based on the residential density of land surrounding the proposed district. 
Until such time as the Agricultural Reserve study is complete, PUDs shall not be developed within this land use category.

Until such time as the Agricultural Reserve study is complete, PUDs shall not be developed within this land use category. ;rn0;0; Ord. No. 2010-10, section 2 states Article 6 "Zoning District" of the Wellington Land Development Regulations is hereby amended by amending Table 6.4.1 to provide that pain management clinics are a conditional use in the Medical Arts Planned Development District, Medical Center Planned Development District, Mixed Use Planned Development District, Multiple Use Planned Development District and Community Commercial District and are prohibited in all other districts listed within that table and Table 6.8.1 is hereby amended to reflect that pain management clinics are prohibited within all land use zones and categories contemplated by that Table. 
D.  Use Regulations. Planned Development District or previously approved planned development shall provide land uses as indicated in Table 6.8-2, (Use Regulations Schedule), unless otherwise restricted by the conditions included in the final development order and subject to the provisions below: 
1.  Administrative categories. All land uses shall be classified into one (1) of the following administrative categories established by this section and Table 6.8-2, Planned Development District Use Regulations Schedule: general land uses; special land uses; or conditional land uses. These land uses are regulated according to pod or land use category as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Atlas. 
2.  General land uses. These uses are allowed in conjunction with an approved Preliminary Development Plan, master plan or site plan and do not require further Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board or Village Council approval prior to approval of a Final Site Plan/Final Subdivision Plan for a building permit; 
a.  Special land uses. These uses require an administrative approval and issuance of a special permit. Special land uses may also require approval by the Development Review Committee; and, 
b.  Conditional land uses. These uses are required to be indicated on a Preliminary Development Plan, master plan or site plan and shall receive Village Council approval. 
3.  Supplementary use standards. A number in the "Note" column of Table 6.8-2, (Planned Development Use Regulation Schedule) refers to supplementary land use standards applicable to a particular land use in one (1) or more of the pods or Comprehensive Plan land use categories in which such use is allowed. These standards are located in Section 6.4.4. (Supplementary use standards). 
4.  Additional conditional uses. Additional uses may be designated as requested land uses by complying with the following: 
a.  Justification. These uses shall be listed and justified in the land use justification report for the Planned Development District or previously approved planned development; and, 
b.  Location. These uses shall be located in pods of Planned Development Districts which are similar and comparable to a standard zoning district in which these uses are allowed. 
5.  Accessory uses. Principal uses listed in the Use Regulations Schedule (Table 6.8-2) are deemed to include accessory uses identified by this Code and such other accessory uses that are necessarily and customarily associated with and are incidental and subordinate to such principal uses. An accessory use shall be subject to the same regulations that apply to the principal use, except as otherwise provided. 
a.  Location. All accessory uses, buildings and structures, except for approved off-site parking, shall be located on the same lot as the principal use in each district, except as otherwise provided. 
b.  Floor area. The permitted accessory use shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the gross floor area or business receipts of the principal use, or uses.

E.  Design Objectives. Planned Developments shall forward the goals of the Comprehensive Plan by complying with the following design guidelines. 
1.  General objectives. 
a.  Land shall contain sufficient width, depth, and frontage on a publicly dedicated arterial or major street or appropriate access thereto as shown on the Village or Palm Beach County Thoroughfare Plan to adequately accommodate its proposed use and design. 
b.  The proposal shall provide a continuous, non-vehicular circulation system and perimeter landscape areas to connect buildings and other land improvements. 
c.  The proposal shall conveniently design and locate parking to encourage pedestrian circulation between land uses. 
d.  The proposal shall preserve existing trees and other natural features of the site to the greatest possible extent.

iv.  Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication. If it is determined that no civic/recreational facility is to be located in whole or part within the proposed development to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, the developer may, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to either fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per acre or the fair market value per acre, whichever is greater, for such required civic/recreational land. Such fee shall be used by the Village as set forth herein. 
v.  Use of Money Received. The money collected under this division shall be paid to the Village. The money shall be placed in a reserve account within the general fund which shall be known as the reserve for civic/recreational facilities. Moneys within the reserve account shall be used and expended solely for the acquisition, improvement, expansion or implementation of civic/recreational facilities of the Village. 
vi.  Requirement of Both Dedication and Fee. A developer shall both dedicate land and pay a fee whenever only a portion of the land calculated by the formula for civic/recreational uses is to be dedicated, in which case that portion shall be dedicated for civic/recreational purposes and a fee shall be paid in lieu of dedicating the remainder of the land that would otherwise have been required to be dedicated. 
vii.  Credit for Private Recreational Space and Facilities. 
(a)  Where private recreational space and facilities are provided in a proposed development and are to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the development, credit may be given for property utilized for such facilities against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof, if the Village Council finds it is in the public interest to do so and if all the following standards are met:

CHAPTER 9. - VOLUNTARY DENSITY BONUS 

Sec. 6.9.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose and intent of the voluntary density bonus program is to provide for the construction of very low and low income housing in the Village and Palm Beach County. This is accomplished by providing for an increase in permitted density (a density bonus) for a specific development in exchange for either: (1) the construction of very low and/or low income housing on site or off-site; (2) a payment in-lieu-of construction into the Housing Trust Fund; or (3) a combination of construction and an in-lieu payment. 
Sec. 6.9.2. - Authority. 
    The Village Council has the authority to adopt this section pursuant to Article VIII, Sec. 1, Fla. Const., Fla. Stat. and Sec. 163.3161, et seq. Fla. Stat. 
Sec. 6.9.3. - Applicability. 
    This section shall apply to all residential development within the urban service area of The Village until such time as the Village Council may adopt specific receiving areas pursuant to the recommendations of the Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board Density Task Force, or in conjunction with the Transfer of Development Rights Study and/or the Urban Form Study. In cases of conflict between this section and other sections of the LDR, the provisions of this section shall prevail. 
    Acceptance of applications for the Voluntary Density Bonus Program is suspended until January 2, 1996 or until appropriate changes are made as determined by the Village Council. This temporary suspension is to provide time to evaluate the County's Affordable Housing Study and to revise the procedures of the Voluntary Density Bonus Program. 
Sec. 6.9.4. - General. 
    A developer may request to exceed the existing permitted density up to one hundred (100) percent to a maximum of eighteen (18) dwelling units per acre, or seventy-five (75) percent of the standard density in the case of Congregate Living Facilities (CLFs), to a maximum of forty-five (45) beds per acre, without filing a Site Specific Comprehensive Plan Amendment. In exchange, the developer must provide for the construction of very low and/or low income housing units in The Village by complying with the component standards of this section. 
Sec. 6.9.5. - Provisions for the construction of very low and/or low income housing. 
    In exchange for the density bonus the developer must provide for the construction of very low and /or low income housing. Density bonus requests that exceed the existing permitted density more than sixty-seven (67) percent shall be required to construct very low and/or low income housing on-site. Density bonus requests up to and equal to a sixty-seven (67) percent increase over the existing permitted density shall provide housing pursuant to one (1) of the three (3) options provided for in this section: (1) construction of units on site, or on another site approved by the Planning & Zoning Director; or (2) payment in-lieu-of construction into the Housing Trust Fund, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). 
A.  Construction of units. The developer shall construct a required number of very low and/or low income housing units in exchange for the receipt of a density bonus. The minimum number of very low and/or low income housing units to be constructed shall be based on the following: 
1.  Density bonus request over sixty-seven (67) percent. Density bonus requests that exceed existing permitted density more than sixty-seven (67) percent must construct very low and /or low income housing on site equal to at least twenty (20) percent of the total number of units proposed, rounding down to the nearest whole number, with a minimum of one (1) unit. 
a.  Rental developments shall include at least ten (10) percent very low income units. 
b.  For-sale properties may include only low income housing. 
c.  CLFs shall include twenty (20) percent very low income housing. 
2.  Density bonus request up to sixty-seven (67) percent. All density bonus requests up to or equal to a sixty-seven (67) percent increase over the existing permitted density may elect to construct twenty (20) percent of the total units proposed as very low and/or low income housing on site or on another site which the Planning & Zoning Director determines is consistent with and furthers the intent of the Comprehensive Plan Housing Element Objective 2 addressing the Voluntary Density Bonus Program and the geographic dispersal of lower income households. 
a.  Rental developments shall include at least ten (10) percent very low income units. 
b.  For-sale developments may include only low income housing. 
c.  CLFs shall include twenty (20) percent very low income housing. 
3.  Assurances of affordability. The developer shall provide language, acceptable to the Village Attorney, which guarantees for a period of at least fifteen (15) years, how the affordability will be maintained for units required to be very low and/or low income pursuant to income categories and definitions of the Comprehensive Plan Housing Element. CLFs shall meet the definition of a very low income individual. 
A guarantee must be documented in the public record and may be in the form of a deed restriction to be recorded on the property and/or resale addendum to the sales agreement or eligibility requirements for rental property, or other method acceptable to the Village Attorney. 
4.  Income qualifications. For units required to be very low and/or low income, a developer shall document in the public record a guarantee, in a manner acceptable to the Village Attorney, that the household, upon entry to the unit, shall meet the definition of a very low or low income household pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan Housing Element. CLFs shall meet the definition of a very low income individual. 
5.  Limitations on qualifications. No occupants of units of very low and/or low income housing constructed pursuant to this program shall be subject to restrictions beyond the income qualifications as defined in the Comprehensive Plan Housing Element. 
6.  Dispersal. The very low and/or low income housing shall not be concentrated within one area of the development or one (1) neighborhood, but rather shall be distributed and integrated throughout the development. 
7.  Housing opportunities. Developments that offer varied bedroom and square footage options shall include similar variation in the construction of very low and/or low income housing required in exchange for the density bonus. 
B.  Payment in-lieu-of construction. A developer, requesting no more than a sixty-seven (67) percent increase in density, may elect to make a payment into the Housing Trust Fund in-lieu-of construction of very low and/or low income housing units. 
1.  Housing Trust Fund. The in-lieu payment shall be placed into the Housing Trust Fund and is subject to the provisions of Housing Trust Fund Ordinance and requirements of this section. 
2.  Land Cost Model. The amount of payment shall be based on the Land Cost Model described below: 
a.  General. The in-lieu payment shall be based on the most recent Village appraisal for the site of the proposed development. 
i.  Calculation of the payment. The appraisal value of an acre of the development site, as appraised for residential use, shall be multiplied by the additional acreage required to build the requested number of units when total acreage requirements of the development are calculated using the existing permitted density. 
ii.  Payment. The total amount of the in-lieu-of payment shall be established at the time of submittal of the General Application for development approval. 
b.  Receipt of Payment. The in-lieu payment shall be pro-rated for each unit based on the total number of units to be built in the development. Payment shall be due prior to the issuance of any building permits for the project. The developer shall pay the pro-rated payment for each unit for which a building permit is to be issued. 
3.  Use of in-lieu fees. All in-lieu fees collected pursuant to the Voluntary Density Bonus Program shall be subject to the conditions established in the Housing Trust Fund Ordinance. 
C.  Combination of construction of units and the payment in-lieu-of construction. The developer, requesting no more than a sixty-seven (67) percent increase in density, may elect to construct only a portion of the very low and/or low income units required in conjunction with a payment in-lieu-of construction to account for the remaining very low and/or low income units required in exchange for the receipt of the density bonus. 
1.  Established proportion of construction to in-lieu payment. The amount of in-lieu fee to be paid in conjunction with construction of very low and/or low income housing units, in exchange for the density bonus, shall be based on the percentage of very low and/or low units to total units to be constructed, as follows: 
Percentage* of 
Very Low/Low Income 
Units to be Constructed Amount of 
Payment in-lieu-of 
to be Paid to the Trust Fund Under 5 percent 100 percent At 5% up to 10% 
(1 unit minimum) 75% At 10% up to 15% 
(1 unit minimum) 50% At 15% up to 20% 
(1 unit minimum) 25% At 20% & Over 
(1 unit minimum) 0%  
* Percentage of the total number of units proposed for the development.

E.  Relationship to streets and off-street parking areas. 
1.  A street or walkway shall not be used for loading or unloading materials. 
2.  An off-street loading area shall not be used to satisfy any off-street parking standards, and the location of the loading area shall not interfere with the free circulation of vehicles in the off- street parking area. 
3.  Where loading areas are directly adjacent to or integrated with an off-street parking lot, the Development Review Committee may require installation of physical barriers, such as curbing, fences, solid hedges, or other means for separation of loading areas from parking areas and pedestrian traffic. 
F.  Dimensional standards and design requirements. Required off-street loading spaces shall be subject to the following minimum dimensional standards: 
1.  Width. A single loading berth shall have a minimum width of 15 feet. Additional loading berths that lie alongside, contiguous to, and not separated from a first loading berth shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width; 
2.  Length. All loading berths shall be a minimum of 55 feet in length; 
3.  Maneuvering apron. An area equal to the width and length of the berth shall be provided for vehicle maneuvering directly behind the loading berth it is intended to serve; 
4.  Vertical clearance. A vertical clearance of at least 15 feet shall be provided throughout the berth and maneuvering apron; and 
5.  Distance from intersections. 
a.  Distance. No loading space or berth shall be located within 40 feet of the nearest point of the edge of pavement or curb of any two intersecting streets. 
b.  Setback. The surfaced portions of all loading areas, excluding driveways, shall be setback at least 20 feet from all front or side corner lines. When located at the rear of a building, a minimum five-foot setback from the property line shall be required. 
G.  Entrances and exits. The location and design of entrances and exits shall be in accordance with Section 7.2.3.M (Ingress and egress to vehicular use areas) and Section 7.7 (Driveways and Access).

CHAPTER 3. - LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING 

Sec. 7.3.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this section is to promote the health, safety, and welfare of existing and future residents of the Village of Wellington by establishing minimum standards for the installation and continued maintenance of landscaping and buffers within the Village of Wellington. The specific objectives of the section are as follows: 
A.  Aesthetics. To improve the aesthetic appearance of development through creative landscaping that helps to harmonize and enhance the natural and built environment; 
B.  Environmental quality. To improve environmental quality by maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation; promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade; reducing heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas through the filtering capacity of trees and other vegetation; reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process of evapotranspiration; and encouraging the use of limited fresh water resources through the use of native and drought resistant plants; 
C.  Water conservation. To promote water conservation by encouraging xeriscaping in appropriate areas, such as medians, and utilization of native and drought tolerant landscape material; encouraging the utilization of water conserving irrigation practices; requiring adherence to sound landscape installation standards and maintenance procedures that promote water conservation; ecological placement of landscape material; and utilization of natural areas and vegetation. 
D.  Preservation of native plants and vegetation. To encourage the preservation and planting of native vegetation and plants; 
E.  Efficiency in land development. To promote efficiency in the development of limited land resources by improving the compatibility of otherwise incompatible land uses in close proximity, particularly residential development that is adjacent to more intensive commercial and industrial development, through the use of landscaped buffers; 
F.  Land values. To maintain and increase the value of land by requiring minimum landscaping which, when installed and maintained properly, becomes a capital asset; 
G.  Human values. To provide physical and psychological benefits to persons through landscaping, by reducing noise and glare, and by softening the harsher visual aspects of urban development; 
H.  Removal of prohibited plant species. To encourage the initial eradication and control the ongoing removal of prohibited plant species which have become nuisances because of their tendency to disrupt or destroy native ecosystems; and 
I.  Improved design. To encourage innovative and cost-effective approaches to the design, installation and maintenance of landscaping, particularly those that promote energy, water conservation and incorporate areas of native vegetation. 
Sec. 7.3.2. - Landscape Design Principles and Concepts. 
    The standards established in this section are to be considered the minimum requirements for landscape design. It is the intent of this section to encourage creativity in landscape design while providing general direction and criteria for the evaluation of landscape plans, planting plans and alternative landscape plans. The following design principles shall be used in evaluating whether standard landscape plans, planting plans and alternative landscape plans conform to the requirements of this section. 
A.  Composition. The quality of a landscape design is as dependent on the composition of its elements as on the quantity and selection of plant materials. Landscape materials should be arranged in a manner as to provide the following qualities and characteristics: 
1.  Texture. Landscape designs should seek to provide a textured appearance through the use of a variety of plant material rather than a single species, contrasting large leaf textures with medium and small leaf textures, and a variety of plant heights at maturity. 
Spacing of key landscaping components, such as trees and shrubs, is an important element of texture and should be consistent with the overall design approach of the landscape plan. Formal landscape designs benefit from a uniform spacing of plants, whereas varied spacing and clustering of trees is more compatible with a naturalistic design. 
2.  Color. Landscape designs should include a variety of plants to provide contrasting color to other plants in the design. Designs are encouraged to include flowering plants and especially a mix of plants that display colorful flowers throughout the year. 
3.  Form. Landscape designs should consider the complete three-dimensional form of the landscape, not simply the form of individual elements. The interrelationship of all landscape components should be considered so that the final landscaping works together to present a coherent whole. Trees, shrubs, and hedges, especially those used for screening and buffering, should display fullness at maturity that is typical of the species. 
B.  Buffering and Screening. The placement of natural landscape materials (trees, shrubs, and hedges) is the preferred method for buffering differing land uses, for providing a transition between adjacent properties, and to screen the view of any parking or storage area, refuse collection, utility enclosures, or service area visible from a public street, alley, or pedestrian area. Plants may be used in concert with fences and/or berms to achieve the desired screen or buffering effect. Landscape material should be mature enough at the time of planting to provide an effective buffer or screen, and should be planted in an appropriate location to allow for desired growth within a reasonable period of time. 
When used to screen an activity area such as a parking lot, landscaping should not obstruct the visibility of motorists or pedestrians and shall not interfere with public safety. 
C.  Responsive to Local Context and Character. Landscape designs should build on the site's and the area's unique physical characteristics, conserving and complementing existing natural features. Naturalistic design elements such as irregular plant spacing, undulating contours, and mixed proportions of plant species should be used to ensure new landscaping blends and contribute to the quality of the surrounding area. Selection and spacing of plant material should be reflective of the neighborhood, district, or area character. If a local plant is identified within an area and is consistent with the requirements of this section, that plant should be incorporated in landscape designs. 
D.  Use of Native and Drought Resistant Plants. Wherever feasible and environmentally beneficial, landscape designs should feature native and/or related plant species, especially in areas adjacent to existing native vegetation, to take advantage of the unique natural character and diversity of the region, and the adaptability of native plants to local environmental conditions. Where feasible, the re-establishment of native habitats should be incorporated into the landscape design. 
In the same manner, landscape designs are encouraged to utilize drought tolerant plant materials to the maximum extent feasible. The use of drought tolerant plants should enrich the existing landscape character, conserve water and energy, and provide as pleasant and varied a visual appearance as plants that require more water. Further, trees and shrubs shall be planted in the energy conservation zone where feasible, in order to reduce energy consumption by shading buildings and shall be used to reduce heat island effects by shading paved surfaces. 
E.  Natural Landscape. Landscape designs should incorporate and complement existing natural landscapes and existing specimen trees and native vegetation (including canopy, understory, and ground cover). Particular care should be given to preserve intact natural ecosystems. Where previous landscaping has dramatically altered natural landscapes, new designs should seek to re-establish natural landscape patterns and plantings. 
F.  Continuity and Connection. Landscaping should be designed in a manner consistent with the adjacent and surrounding landscape, provided that the surrounding and planned landscaping is also consistent with the other design principles. Plant materials should blend well with adjacent properties, particularly where property edges meet, to create a seamless and natural landscape. Exceptions should be made when seeking to create a transition between uses, districts, and tiers. 
G.  Enhancing Architecture. Landscape design should be compatible with and enhance architectural character and features and help relate structure design to the site. Major landscape elements should be designed to complement architectural elevations and rooflines through color, texture, density, and form on both vertical and horizontal planes. Landscaping should be in scale with adjacent buildings and be of appropriate size at maturity to accomplish intended goals. Foundation planting and window boxes should be designed to be compatible with a building's architectural character and are strongly encouraged to incorporate artistic elements. 
H.  Energy Conservation and Sustainable Design . Attention should be given to locating landscape elements in a manner that provides energy conservation benefits. Shade trees planted in the energy conservation zone, for example, can provide daytime shading for buildings, reducing energy needed for interior air conditioning. Landscape design should also consider natural drainage features and the use of pervious surfaces and areas to minimize runoff. 
I.  Pedestrian Importance. In pedestrian-oriented development types, landscape designs should give special attention to the needs of pedestrians. Where landscaping is provided on both sides of a sidewalk, pedestrians should have the experience of walking through a landscape that is separated by a path, as opposed to walking past two (2) separate landscapes that happen to be on either side of a path. Benches, kiosks, artwork and other streetscape elements should be incorporated into landscaping in high activity areas. Pedestrian access to sidewalks or buildings shall be considered in the design of all landscaped areas. 
Sec. 7.3.3. - Applicability; Effect on Previously Permitted Projects. 
    The provisions of this section shall be considered minimum standards and shall apply to all development in the Village, except that development exempted in Section 7.3.4 (Exemptions). For previously approved development orders, refer to Section 1.5 in Article 1 of the LDR. 
Sec. 7.3.4. - Exemptions. 
    The following development shall be exempt from the standards and requirements of this section. All landscaping, however, is subject to the maintenance, pruning and replacement requirements listed in Section 7.3.12:

b.  Low Shrub: Required height - two (2) feet to three (3) feet 
c.  Medium Shrub: Required height - four (4) feet to six (6) feet 
d.  High Shrub: Required height - greater than six (6) feet 
5.  Non-living barriers in landscape buffer strips adjacent to a right-of-way. If a wall or fence or other non-living barrier is used, they shall be located on the interior edge of the required landscape buffer strip with the required landscaping located between the wall, fence or other non-living barrier and the right-of-way. If the placement of the wall, fence or non-living barrier conflicts with a pre-existing dedicated easement, the wall, fence or non-living barrier shall not encroach the easement, unless the provisions of Section 6.5.11 (Easement encroachment) are satisfied. Non-living barriers shall require additional landscaping to soften them and enhance their appearance. For each ten (10) feet of non-living barrier, two (2) shrubs or vines shall be planted along the street side of the barrier, in addition to tree requirements. 
6.  Right-of-Way buffer width reduction. Where properties are separated from the street by a canal, lake and/or passive open space with a total minimum width of fifty (50) feet or greater, the buffer width may be reduced by fifty (50) percent. The reduced buffer shall contain a minimum of five (5) clear feet for planting, or if a wall with a continuous footer is used, a minimum of ten (10) clear feet for planting. The quantity of required plant material shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the buffer width. 
7.  Clustering. Canopy trees and palms may be clustered in right-of-way buffers for non-residential developments only if the clusters: 
a.  are spaced a maximum of sixty (60) feet apart; 
b.  consist of trees of varied height, which when averaged, equal the minimum tree height required; and 
c.  are located on property containing a minimum of three hundred (300) linear feet along a right-of-way. 
B.  Perimeter Landscape Buffer. 
1.  General Tree, Shrub and Hedge Standard. 
a.  Canopy Tree Planting. In calculating the number of trees to be planted, fractional distances shall be rounded down. With Planning, Zoning and Building Director's approval, up to ten (10) percent of the total number of required trees may be reduced in height by ten (10) percent, provided that an additional tree, at least eight (8) feet in height is planted for each tree with reduced height. All canopy trees shall be container grown or root pruned in the field. The width of access ways which traverse required landscape strips shall be included in the calculation of linear dimension. Required trees shall at installation have no minimum clear trunk requirements and a minimum six (6) foot canopy spread, except as otherwise noted. In addition, trees shall be allowed to attain a minimum eight (8) foot canopy spread, except as otherwise noted. The diameter of spread of the canopy shall be determined by the average canopy radius at three (3) points measured from the trunk to the outermost branch tip. 
b.  Palm and Slash Pine Tree Planting. Palms and slash pines planted in perimeter buffers shall be installed in groups of no less than three (3). Each group of palms or slash pines shall average ten (10) feet in height and may be counted as one (1) required canopy tree. 
c.  Shrub. At the time of installation, required shrubs shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in height, or eighteen (18) inches in height for native species. Required shrubs shall form a continuous solid opaque visual screen of at least thirty-six (36) inches in height within two (2) years of planting unless the shrubs forms a barrier hedge, in which case the hedge shall comply with the requirements of Section 6.6. 
d.  Alternative use of native vegetation. Existing native vegetation shall be deemed to satisfy the landscape buffer standards, in total or in part, upon the approval of the Development Review Committee. In determining whether native vegetation satisfies the buffer standards, the following shall be considered: 
i.  The effectiveness of the visual screening which will be provided; 
ii.  The quality of the vegetation being preserved; 
iii.  The proposed native buffer makes use of existing native 
iv.  vegetation, which may include trees. If no trees exist in the proposed buffer, no additional trees will be required if adequate screening is provided; and 
v.  Native vegetation from areas of the site to be developed may be relocated the buffer area. 
2.  Compatibility landscape buffer strips. 
a.  General. The entire perimeter landscaping shall be installed for residential and non-residential developments, other than Planned Development Districts, prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy. For a phased residential development, the buffer strip shall be installed along the entire perimeter of each phase. The buffer strips shall be maintained and preserved along the entire length of the property. The width of landscape buffer strips shall not include utility easements. 
b.  Width. A five-foot wide buffer shall be required between all compatible use types, excluding single-family residential subdivisions or pods adjacent to single-family residential subdivisions or pods. Except for trees, the remainder of the landscape area shall be landscaped with grass or living ground cover and organic mulch. 
c.  Trees. A six-foot wall and minimum fourteen (14) foot tall trees spaced no more than twenty (20) feet on center. The minimum area of a tree planting area shall be twenty (20) square feet, and the minimum dimensions shall be four (4) feet by five (5) feet.

Notes to Table 7.3-8: 
1. All walls shall be masonry construction or an alternative approved by the Planning & Zoning Director, and shall extend the full length of the property line. Both sides of the wall shall be given finished architectural treatment which is compatible and harmonious with abutting developments and the wall shall contain no openings except gates or similar means of access that may be approved during site plan approval. 
2. If a wall or fence is used, the landscaping shall be located between the landscape barrier and the adjacent property, unless approved otherwise by the Development Review Committee and must be in compliance with Section 6.6(A)(2). 
3. When hedges are used alone in a buffer, hedges shall present a continuous solid opaque visual screen a minimum of six (6) feet in height at time of installation. 
4. If the same type of landscape buffer exists on an abutting property, the width of one (1) buffer may be reduced fifty (50) percent and a minimum of five (5) clear feet for planting shall be required or if a wall with a continuous footer is used a minimum of ten (10) clear feet of planting. Back to back walls shall be avoided. 
5. The Development Review Committee may impose special standards on the following uses: recreation and civic uses within a residential subdivision or pod within a Planned Unit Development or property owned by the Village of Wellington or Palm Beach County School District. 
Sec. 7.3.11. - Upland buffers/Littoral Planting. 
    Lake areas (retention ponds) in excess of one (1) acre in area shall be planted to create a habitat that provides the optimal environment for aquatic and other species. Lakes provided for new construction or major modifications of existing projects shall be planted as follows: 
A.  Littoral plantings. To occupy a minimum of fifty (50) percent of lake perimeter with littoral plantings 
B.  Littoral shelf. To consist of a minimum of ten (10) square feet of littoral shelf per linear foot of lake. 
C.  Trees. To consist of a minimum of one (1) native tree per fifty (50) feet of linear lake frontage.

    All littoral and upland plantings established consistent with these standards shall be maintained in accordance with a management plan approved by the Village at the time of site plan approval or permitting. The management plan shall include: i) a map showing the limits of the water bodies covered by the plan; ii) the chemicals being applied to the water bodies, including the amounts of each chemical and application schedule; iii) the specific aquatic vegetation being addressed including, but not limited to, water hyacinths, chara, cattails, broadleaf weeds, hydrilla, algae, coon-tail, milfoil, southern naiad, torpedo grass, alligatorweed, duckweed, ditchbank grasses and other waterborne weeds; and iv) the name and address of the aquatic vegetation control contractor along with the copies of appropriate licensees and insurances. 
Sec. 7.3.12. - Installation, maintenance, irrigation and replacement. 
    The following standards shall be considered the minimum required installation, maintenance, irrigation and replacement standards for all trees and landscape material. 
A.  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed according to acceptable nursery practices (American Society of Landscape Architects) in a manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. Soil improvement measures may be required to ensure healthy plant growth. A plant or tree's growth characteristics shall be considered before planting to prevent conflicts with views, lighting, infrastructure, utilities or signage. Proposed lighting and signage plans shall be submitted with landscape plans for approval before installation. 
1.  Phasing. Required landscaping may be installed in phases, if it is designated on the approved site plan as follows: 
a.  Planned developments. The number of trees required to be planted or preserved in a construction phase of a planned development shall be a proportion of the total number of trees required to be planted in the overall planned development. This proportion shall be determined by comparing the area of the phase plan to the area of the entire planned development as shown on the approved plan. Areas of vegetation required to be preserved shall be excluded from the calculation. 
b.  Other developments. The entire perimeter landscaping shall be installed for residential and non-residential developments, prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy or completion or in accordance with an approved phasing plan by the DRC. 
2.  Construction. It shall be unlawful for any person in the construction of any structure or other improvement to place materials, machinery or temporary soil deposits within the drip line of any tree and during construction the builder shall be required to erect suitable protective barriers around all such trees to be preserved. Trees designated for protection during construction that do not survive will be replaced by a tree of equal size or an equivalent number of trees based on trunk diameter. The minimum barricading shall be in accordance with specifications set forth in the "Tree Protection Manual for Builders and Developers," by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. A monetary performance assurance instead of or in addition to a protective barricade may be required to ensure protection of a tree or trees or to guarantee restoration of an equivalency. The amount of said assurance shall be based upon the equivalent value of the tree or trees specifically covered. Any assurance required for a "protected tree" shall be four (4) times the equivalent value for that tree. 
3.  Protection. All trees shall be properly guyed and staked at the time of planting until establishment, however, no later than one (1) year from installation of the tree. The use of nails, wire or rope or any other method which damages the trees is prohibited. All plants shall be installed so that the top of the root ball remains even with the soil grade. All materials shall be treated with fertilizer tablets immediately after planting. Three (3) inches of mulch is required around all planting materials. For trees and shrubs, the planting soil shall consist of a mixture of fifty (50) percent mulch and fifty (50) percent of clean brown soil. 
B.  Maintenance. The property owner, or successors in interest, or agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the following: 
1.  Regular maintenance of all landscaping in a way that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds and litter. This maintenance shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing, edging, mulching or other maintenance, as needed, consistent with acceptable horticultural practices; 
2.  Regular maintenance, repair or replacement of landscape barriers and maintenance of required landscape structures (e.g., walls, fences) in a structurally sound condition; 
3.  Perpetual maintenance to prohibit the reestablishment of prohibited and non-native species within landscaping and preservation areas; and 
4.  All trees shall be allowed to grow to their natural mature height and a full canopy. Large and medium canopy trees shall be required to attain a minimum twenty (20) foot canopy spread prior to pruning. In no case shall the canopy spread be reduced to less than twenty (20) feet in width. Maintenance shall be limited to periodic trimming to maintain healthy trees, removal of diseased limbs, or removal of limbs or foliage that present a hazard. 
5.  Landscape areas which are required to be created or preserved by this section shall not be used for the storage/display of materials or sale of products or services. 
6.  The owner or tenant shall maintain all landscaped areas in a manner consistent with the site plan or landscape plan approved for the property and consistent with the requirements of this section. If a property owner changes and/or removes without replacement thirty (30) percent or more of the required landscaping, excluding trees, then a landscaping permit with proposed landscape plan shall be submitted and approved by the Planning and Zoning Division. If no site plan or landscape plan is in existence, then the property owner must meet existing code requirements. 
7.  Landscaping and barrier hedges shall be trimmed and maintained in a healthy and neat condition and shall not extend onto or over public properties, rights-of-way or easements. 
C.  Pruning. Pruning is permitted to allow for healthy tree growth, to promote safety considerations and enhance the aesthetic value of plant material. Trees which cause a conflict with views, signage or lighting shall not be pruned more than the maximum allowed nor pruned in conflict with the maintenance standards above. The Planning & Zoning Director may suspend the provisions of this section upon finding that additional pruning is necessary for plant growth, safety or aesthetics. 
1.  A maximum of one fourth (0.25) of tree canopy may be removed from a tree within a one (1) year period, provided that the removal conforms to the standards of crown reduction, crown cleaning, crown thinning, crown raising, vista pruning and crown restoration pruning techniques. All pruning shall comply with the American National Standards Institute, ANSI 300-1995 (Tree, Shrub and other Woody Plant Maintenance) as amended. The crown of a tree required by this Code or condition of approval shall not be reduced below the minimum spread or height requirements of Section 7.3(3)(6) or specific Village Council conditions of approval. A tree which is pruned in excess of these requirements shall be replaced with a tree that meets the minimum requirements of Section 7.3 and Table 7.3-3. 
2.  If other than the mature height and spread is desired for any required tree the size and shape shall be indicated on an approved landscape, planting or alternative landscaping plan. Shaping of a tree shall be permitted if the tree is to be used as an accent, focal point or as part of an overall landscape design. A maintenance program shall be clearly outlined on the approved landscape plan to explain the care and upkeep of a shaped tree. 
3.  In reducing overall size, attention shall be given to symmetrical appearance. Vertical growth is to be encouraged and the sides reduced in order to maintain a "tree-like" form. 
4.  When cutting back trees, care shall be taken to promote shape and form typical of their species in similar settings in the Village. 
5.  All cuts shall be made sufficiently close to the trunk or parent limb, without cutting into the branch collar or leaving a protruding stub. Clean cuts shall be made at all times. 
6.  Climbing and pruning practices shall not injure the tree except for the pruning cuts. 
7.  Treatment of cuts and wounds with a tree wound dressing is to be carried out within twenty-four (24) hours of the cuts being made. Materials non-toxic to the cambium layer shall be used, and care shall be taken to treat only the exposed wood with a thin coat of dressing. 
8.  Tools shall be disinfected with diluted chlorine solution (bleach) or methyl alcohol at seventy (70) percent (denatured wood alcohol diluted appropriately with water) or suitable solution after each cut and between trees where there is known to be a danger of transmitting disease on tools. 
9.  Tree injuries are to be annually inspected. Those not closing properly and where callus growth is not completely established shall be treated. 
10.  Tree topping (hatracking) is prohibited and shall be defined as the cutting back of limbs to a point between branch collars/buds, larger than one (1) inch in diameter within the tree's crown. 
11.  No large or medium canopy trees shall be pruned before it has a minimum of twenty (20) foot canopy spread prior to pruning. 
12.  Palm pruning. 
a.  No more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of fronds shall be removed.

CHAPTER 4. - PRESERVATION OF CRITICAL RESOURCES 

Sec. 7.4.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement the policies of the Future Land Use and Conservation Elements in the Village of Wellington Comprehensive Plan by establishing an administrative review process to prevent the unnecessary removal or destruction of existing native upland vegetation and jurisdictional wetlands. Consistency with these policies will be achieved through: 
1.  Limitations on the timing and extent of removal of vegetation from a site. 
2.  Required compliance with state and federal wetland regulations. 
3.  Establishment of preserve areas for jurisdictional wetlands and a portion of native upland vegetation. 
B.  Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Wellington to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its residents by encouraging beneficial land, forest, and wetland management practices. The minimum standards and administrative procedures established by this section help achieve these goals by: 
1.  Conserving Natural Resources. Existing trees, vegetation, and wetlands, individually, in significant grouping, or in natural ecosystems, are essential elements of the Village's environmental heritage. 
2.  Serving Functional Values. Trees and vegetation serve a number of invaluable environmental, social, educational, and aesthetic functions, including: 
a.  Maintaining air quality through photosynthesis. 
b.  Maintaining permeable land areas for aquifer recharge and surface water filtration. 
c.  Reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, and water pollution. 
d.  Promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade, reducing heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas, and reducing the temperature of the microclimate through evapotranspiration. 
e.  Reducing erosion by stabilizing the soil. 
f.  Providing habitat and corridors for wildlife. 
g.  Providing direct and increasingly important psychological and physical benefits to human beings by reducing noise and glare, breaking up the monotony, and softening the harsh aspects of urban development. 
h.  Serving as educational, aesthetic, historic, and cultural resources. 
i.  Buffering and providing a transition area between otherwise incompatible types of development. 
j.  Increasing economic value of land by serving as a capital asset in site design. 
k.  Promoting the use of plant species native to South Florida through relocation and installation. 
3.  Preserving Land Values through Innovative Site Design. When properly incorporated into site design, natural features serve as a capital asset. 
4.  Preventing Destructive Land Development Practices. The land clearing practices of speculative clearing or grubbing without a bona fide development plan may result in the removal of native upland vegetation or wetlands that may have otherwise been preserved or relocated. 
5.  Encouraging Water Conservation. The preservation of existing plant communities, reestablishment of native plant communities, site development that retains stormwater runoff on site, and recognition of environmentally sensitive site development concepts prevent excessive use of water, reduce evaporation (compared to impervious surface areas), and generally conserve regional water resources. 
Sec. 7.4.2. - Applicability. 
A.  Affected Parcels. The provisions of this section shall apply to all undeveloped property except for: 
1.  Single-family lots with an area of 1.25 acres or less that are either lots of record, were legally subdivided, or were shown on a recorded map, plat, drawing, or survey prior to June 25, 2002, the date of adoption of this ordinance. 
2.  Undeveloped parcels or undeveloped portions of parcels with an existing valid development order; provided, however, the provisions of this section shall apply to any request to modify any development order or permit for such undeveloped parcels or portions of undeveloped parcels. 
B.  Conflict with Other Regulations. This section is intended to complement and not conflict with other Village, county, state, and federal environmental regulations. However, in cases of conflict, the more restrictive regulations shall apply to the extent of the conflict. Further, exemption from compliance with these regulations does not constitute exemption from other applicable state, federal, and local regulations, which must be fully complied with. 
Sec. 7.4.3. - Exempt Activities. 
    The following activities are exempt from these requirements: 
A.  Utilities and Easements. Any alteration to design specifications, pursuant to the direction of public or private utility organizations or agencies, water control district, or water management district within drainage easements where such activity has received all required construction and/or operating permits. 
B.  Management Plan Activities. Alterations or activities associated with the adopted management plan for government maintained parks, recreation areas, wildlife management areas, conservation areas, and preserves. 
C.  Enhancements and Restoration. The removal of vegetation by the Village or County, or their agents, for the purposes of environmental enhancement or environmental restoration as part of an approved mitigation, enhancement, or restoration plan. 
Sec. 7.4.4. - Wetlands. 
A.  Applicability. No net loss of function from wetlands, as defined by the state (Chapter 373, Florida Statutes) and federal (40CFR Part 232) government, shall be permitted within the Village of Wellington, except as specifically provided for in this section. 
B.  Verification. When a development application is submitted to the Village for master and/or site plan approval, the application shall include an environmental site assessment that identifies all wetland areas on the parcel. 
C.  Wetland Determination. If the environmental site assessment verifies the existence of wetlands, the application shall also include a written jurisdictional determination from the appropriate state and federal agencies, such as the South Florida Water Management District, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and the Army Corps of Engineers, and a determination of non-jurisdictional wetlands. 
D.  Upland Buffer Requirements. 
1.  All wetlands shall, at a minimum, be protected by a native upland buffer with an average width of twenty-five (25) feet and a minimum width at any one (1) point of fifteen (15) feet. 
2.  All wetlands and associated native buffers shall be set aside and designated on the site plan as preserve areas and be protected by a preserve management plan. 
E.  Mitigation. Any proposed impacts to wetlands shall be mitigated as required by the Village and/or appropriate state and federal agencies. A copy of the mitigation plan approved by applicable state and/or federal agencies shall be submitted to the Village prior to any legally authorized alteration of wetlands on a site. Wetland mitigation shall occur within the Village boundaries if feasible. 
Sec. 7.4.5. - Native Upland Vegetation. 
A.  Verification. All development applications for site plan approval shall include an environmental site assessment that identifies those areas of the site, if any, where native upland vegetation exists. 
B.  Minimum Preservation Requirements. 
1.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the total native upland vegetation on site shall be preserved. 
2.  A native upland buffer around wetlands and/or native habitat preserved for listed species may be counted toward meeting the native upland vegetation preserve requirement. 
3.  If more than one (1) native upland plant community exists on the parcel, the more rare plant communities (such as sandhill, scrub, dry prairie, xeric hammock, and scrubby flatwoods) shall be given preference over the more common plant communities (such as mesic flatwoods and prairie hammock) when designating the preserve area(s). 
C.  Preserve Areas. 
1.  Location. Whenever possible, preserve areas should form a contiguous tract, be adjacent to wetlands, or link to adjacent parcel preserves. Wildlife corridors should be established where possible. 
2.  Minimum Size. The size of the preserve area should be adequate to maintain long-term viability and maximize wildlife utilization. Preserve areas should be at least one-fourth (1/4) acre, or ten thousand eight hundred ninety (10,890) square feet in size. 
3.  Designation and Management. All preserved native upland habitat shall be identified on the site plan, designated as preserve areas, and protected by a preserve management plan. 
D.  Mitigation. 
1.  The ability to mitigate for native upland preserve areas shall be determined by the Village during the development review process. This determination shall be based on the environmental site assessment, prepared by the applicant, addressing the reasons for mitigation, which may include one (1) or more of the following circumstances: 
a.  The native vegetation is not in a viable condition such that it could be restored. 
b.  The size of the resulting preserve area would not meet the minimum size of one fourth (1/4) acre nor can the preserve area be linked to other preserve areas to create a one-fourth (1/4) acre preserve. 
c.  The location of the proposed preserve area is such that a permitted use could not be reasonably established on the parcel. 
d.  The site is proposed for a public project that will provide substantial benefit to the health, safety, and welfare of citizens. 
2.  The mitigation options are: 
a.  Off-site Mitigation. The applicant may propose to preserve similar or more rare native upland vegetation elsewhere within the Village, at a ratio of three (3) units of preserved off-site native upland vegetation for each one (1) unit not preserved on site. The following conditions shall apply: 
i.  The off-site preserve area shall be property that is not already in conservation or preservation. 
ii.  The off-site preserve area shall be applied towards meeting the preservation requirements for only one (1) parcel of land or development. 
iii.  The preserve area requirements of Subsection 3 [c] above shall apply to all off-site mitigation preserve areas. 
iv.  Off-site preservation shall be complete prior to issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for the property that is the subject of the development application proposing off-site mitigation. 
b.  Environmental Restoration or Creation. Off-site restoration, reestablishment, or creation of native plant communities or habitat that will be beneficial to listed species and that is equal to three hundred (300) percent of the area required for preservation on the subject property may be accepted as mitigation provided these activities occur on publicly-owned lands within the Village. All proposed restorative, reestablishment, or creation work shall be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the property that is the subject of the development application proposing such off-site mitigation. 
c.  Payment in Lieu of Preservation. The Village may accept cash payments in lieu of preservation of native upland habitat if no other practicable mitigation options are available. These payments will be used to fund the acquisition of land containing similar native upland habitat or for ecological improvements to public lands. The amount of the cash payment shall be equivalent to three (3) times the fair market value of the land, as determined by a certified appraiser selected by the Village, using the proposed development of the parcel as the basis for valuation. These funds shall be deposited in the appropriate Village account prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the property. 
Sec. 7.4.6. - Listed Species. 
A.  Applicability. If the environmental site assessment for the property reveals the presence or probability of listed species, the following regulations shall apply. 
B.  Minimum Requirements. 
1.  Coordination. The applicant shall submit written evidence of coordination with all applicable agencies (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) concerning the listed species at the time of development application submission. 
2.  Action. The applicant shall take whatever action is determined appropriate by the regulating agency to preserve the listed species, including increasing the size of native upland and/or wetland preserve areas to provide adequate habitat. Relocation of listed species to an off-site preserve may be permitted provided the regulating agency approves a relocation plan. A copy of the approved relocation plan shall be submitted to the Village prior to issuance of a final development order. 
Sec. 7.4.7. - Preserve Areas. 
A.  Applicability. All applicants for development approval on sites that contain native upland vegetation or wetland preserve areas shall demonstrate compliance with the following minimum standards. 
B.  Protection During Construction Activities. Preserve areas shall be protected during construction by a minimum ten-foot setback. This construction setback shall: 
1.  Have its perimeter marked using metal or wood stakes and flagging. 
2.  Be protected from stormwater runoff. 
3.  Be maintained in its natural state, except that invasive, non-native vegetation shall be removed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. No earthwork or construction or placement of structures (temporary or permanent) shall be permitted within the setback. 
4.  Be subject to the provisions of the Natural Resource Protection Regulations, Tree Protection, of the LDR. 
Construction activities on a site shall not commence until the Planning & Zoning Director has verified the existence of the required construction setback. 
C.  Protection after Construction. The perpetual protection of designated preserve areas shall be established by a conservation easement, consistent with the requirements of Section 704.06, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time. The conservation easement shall be held by the Village of Wellington and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Village Attorney prior to issuance of a final development order. In addition to a conservation easement, perpetual protection and maintenance of the preserve may be assured through: 
1.  Dedication of the preserve area to an appropriate Village, county, state, or federal agency. The applicant shall provide written verification of this dedication (including a written statement from the public agency accepting the dedication) prior to issuance of a final development order. The written verification shall also address the availability of adequate technical and financial resources for maintenance and protection of the preserve. 
2.  Dedication of a preserve area to a homeowner's or property owner's association provided: 
a.  The preserve area shall remain undivided. The covenant shall provide that such areas have been encumbered for the perpetual benefit of the public, as well as members of the association, and all future use shall be consistent with the adopted preserve management plan. 
b.  The covenants shall contain an obligation by members of the association to pay for and ensure implementation of proper care and maintenance of the preserve areas. 
c.  The covenants are reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney prior to the issuance of the final development order. 
D.  Permitted Uses. The only uses permitted in preserve areas are passive recreation and observation uses, as well as preserve maintenance activities. These uses may be further limited if listed species are present in the preserve area. 
E.  Preserve Management Plans. All applicants for development approval on sites that contain wetland, native upland vegetation, or listed species preserve areas shall submit a preserve management plan for review and approval by the Planning & Zoning Director. The preserve management plan shall be incorporated into the development approval by reference and may not be changed without written approval from the Village. Preserve management plans shall contain the information listed below: 
1.  Multifamily Developments, Planned Unit Developments, Homeowner/Property Owner Associations, and Nonresidential Uses. Preserve management plans for these developments shall address the following: 
a.  Identify the location of the preserve area(s), including the size. 
b.  Identify the party responsible for maintenance of preserve and provide procedures for the transfer of responsibilities when applicable. 
c.  Restrictions on modification or alteration of preserve area size, vegetation type, or function without Village approval. In residential developments, the preserve management plan should identify the means to be used to notify individual lot owners of the existence, location, and regulations pertaining to the preserve area(s). 
d.  Removal and continued regular management of invasive, non-native vegetation and debris. For a period of five (5) years following the establishment of the preserve area, monitoring and complete removal of invasive, non-native vegetation shall occur every six (6) months. During this period, the preserve area shall be maintained with a minimum of eighty (80) percent desired vegetation. Between monitoring visits, no more than five (5) percent of the preserve area should be infested with invasive, non-native vegetation. If more than five (5) percent of the preserve area is consistently infested with invasive, non-native vegetation (as noted during monitoring visits), the Village may require more frequent monitoring. An annual report each year on the status of the preserve area, including photographs of the preserve area taken during the semi-annual monitoring, shall be provided to the Village. If more than five (5) percent of the preserve area is reported in the annual report as infested with invasive, non-native vegetation, the Village may require additional monitoring and complete removal of invasive, non-native vegetation. 
e.  Procedures for the removal of any illegally located structures, to limit encroachment of turf grasses, and to prevent destruction of wildlife by domestic and feral (meaning previously domesticated but now wild) animal populations. 
f.  Revegetation of preserve with native plant material, if necessary. 
g.  Protection of listed species in accordance with recommendations from applicable state and federal agencies. 
h.  Habitat management practices, including prescribed burning or other methods to stimulate natural processes.

3.  Suspension of Review. If a restoration plan for damaged preserve areas is not submitted within thirty (30) days following the notice of violation, the Village may suspend issuance of further permits for the property (including building permits, inspections, and occupational licenses). 
4.  Additional Sanctions. If, after sixty (60) days of the notice of violation, a restoration plan has not been submitted, the Village may place a lien on the property in an amount equal to the sum of any unpaid fines and the reasonable cost for repairing the damage. Once collected, these funds may be used for the acquisition, restoration, or enhancement of publicly-owned conservation parcels. 
Sec. 7.4.10. - Variation from Minimum Property Development Regulations. 
    In order to accommodate the preservation of wetlands, native upland vegetation, and habitat for listed species, the Planning & Zoning Director may: 
    Waive up to twenty (20) percent of a required property line setback standard; 
    or 
    Waive up to ten (10) percent of the required parking spaces for nonresidential development. 
    If the applicant has requested variations to either of these standards for other reasons, the decision to allow a further variation for preservation purposes shall be made by the Village Council, based on a recommendation from the Planning & Zoning Director. 
CHAPTER 5. - TREE PROTECTION 

Sec. 7.5.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement the policies of the Future Land Use and Conservation Elements in the Village of Wellington Comprehensive Plan by establishing an administrative review and permitting process to prohibit the unnecessary removal or destruction of native trees and requires the removal of certain invasive, non-native plant species by: 
1.  Limiting the removal of vegetation from a site until the approval of a bona fide site development plan. 
2.  Preserving and incorporating specimen trees into the site design. 
3.  Prohibiting speculative clearing. 
4.  Providing protection for individual trees located outside preserve areas. 
5.  Requiring the removal of invasive, non-native plants prior to occupancy or use of a parcel. 
B.  Intent. It is the intent of the Village to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its residents by encouraging the protection of native vegetation. The minimum standards of this section help achieve this goal by: 
1.  Conserving Natural Resources. Existing trees and vegetation, individually, in significant grouping, or in natural ecosystems, are essential elements of the Village's environmental heritage. 
2.  Serving Functional Values. Trees and vegetation serve a number of invaluable environmental, economic, social, educational, and aesthetic functions, including:

i.  Buffering and providing a transition area between otherwise incompatible types of development. 
j.  Increasing economic value of land by serving as a capital asset in site design. 
k.  Promoting the use of plant species native to South Florida through relocation and installation. 
3.  Preventing Destructive Land Development Practices. The land clearing practices of grubbing or speculative clearing of lots without a bona fide site development plan or a comparable preservation management plan may result in the removal of native vegetation that may have otherwise been preserved or relocated. 
Sec. 7.5.2. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this section shall apply to all property within the Village of Wellington. This section is intended to complement and not conflict with other Village, state, and federal environmental regulations. However, in cases of conflict, the more restrictive regulations shall apply to the extent of the conflict. 
Sec. 7.5.3. - Exempt Activities. 
    The following activities are exempt from these requirements: 
A.  Land Surveying. The minimal removal of trees or understory by a Florida licensed land surveyor necessary for the performance of his or her duties provided the swath cleared shall not exceed five (5) feet in width and hand clearing shall be used to remove vegetation. If survey lines greater than five (5) feet in width are required, the Village shall be notified, and a permit shall be required. 
B.  Utilities and Easements. Any alteration to design specification, pursuant to the direction of public or private utility organizations or agencies, water control district, or water management district within drainage easements where such activity has received all required construction and/or operating permits.

CHAPTER 13. - ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROTECTION 

Sec. 7.13.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    It is hereby declared that the protection, enhancement and examination of significant archaeological resources is in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of the people of the Village of Wellington. It is acknowledged that within the Village of Wellington there exist sites which are of significant archaeological value as prehistoric, historic and cultural resources. 
    The purposes of this section are to: 
A.  Procedure for review. Establish a procedure for review of development proposals on lands which have been identified as containing archaeological resources and which will be applicable to lands identified by the predictive model when added to this section by amendment. 
B.  Method to review. Establish a method to review the potential archaeological value of previously unidentified sites after the discovery of prehistoric and historical artifacts, skeletal or fossilized human remains, or non-human vertebrate fossils during development. 
C.  Protection. Establish a mechanism to protect, when appropriate, resources of significant archaeological value identified pursuant to this section that am deemed important by a qualified archaeologist to the prehistory or history of the Village, County, State or Nation. 
D.  Facilitate protection. Facilitate protection of resources of significant archaeological value without substantially delaying development. 
Sec. 7.13.2. - Applicability. 
    This section is applicable in the Village of Wellington and shall apply to: 
A.  Archaeological site. All parcels of land which are identified as archaeological sites. 
B.  Previously unidentified site. A parcel on which a previously unidentified artifact or any human skeletal or fossilized human remain or non-human vertebrate fossils of significant archaeological value is found during site development or during any other activity which may disturb an archeological site; and, 
C.  Type III excavation. All applications for Type III Excavation. 
Sec. 7.13.3. - Development subject to archaeological review. 
    Development shall be subject to this section as follows: 
A.  Parcels on identified sites. Parcels with known archaeological sites and proposals for type III excavation. Owners of known Archaeological Sites or Owners of parcels requesting approval for Type III Excavation must receive a Certificate to Dig prior to issuance of a development order. 
B.  Parcels on previously unidentified sites. Previously unidentified archaeological sites discovered during development. When one (1) or more artifacts or human skeletal or fossilized remains or non-human vertebrate fossils which were previously undiscovered are found on a site during development or during other activity disturbing the site, all development or disruptive activity directly over the find shall cease. Before any further development or disruptive activity continues, the following procedure shall apply: 
1.  The area directly over the find shall be staked by the property owner or agent of the property owner, contractor or subcontractor, or other party discovering the potential find; 
2.  Within one (1) working day of discovering the potential find, the Department and, if applicable, the property owner shall be notified; 
3.  Within ten (10) working days, the Department shall request inspection and evaluation of the site by a qualified archaeologist for the purpose of determining whether artifacts or human skeletal or fossilized remains or non-human vertebrate fossils are located on a site. The property owner or developer shall pay costs associated with the archaeological evaluation. If the qualified archaeologist determines a significant archaeological resource is on site or likely to be on site, the Director of the Planning, Zoning and Building Department shall issue an order suspending construction and define the area where the order suspending construction applies, based upon the archaeologist's assessment. Such order does not have the effect of a stop work order and shall not stop construction activity not directly impacting the defined potential archaeological site; 
4.  The Archaeologist shall evaluate the significance of the archaeological find and send a written Archaeological Evaluation Report to the property owner and the Planning, Zoning, and Building Department Director postmarked within fifteen (15) working days from issuance of the suspension order. 
5.  Using the Archaeological Evaluation Report, the Department shall require an application for a Certificate to Dig be prepared if the archaeologist determines the site contains artifacts of significant archaeological value. If the Archaeologist determines that there is no reasonable possibility that artifacts of significant archaeological value are contained on the site, the archaeologist shall make such a finding to the Department in the Archaeological Evaluation Report, and the Department shall lift the suspension order. 
6.  In order to encourage individuals to bring potential artifacts to the Village's attention, private citizens engaged in disruptive activity which does not require a development order and uncover a potential artifact, fossil, or remains, may request a waiver of application fees and shall not be subject to the timeframes required in this subsection. 
C.  Sites containing human skeletal remains. If human skeletal remains are found, then Section 872.05, Florida Statutes (2001), as amended from time to time, controls. 
Sec. 7.13.4. - Certificate to dig. 
A.  Application.

CHAPTER 14. - SIGN REGULATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2009-16, § 1(Att. 1), adopted Nov. 24, 2009, amended Ch. 14 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 14, §§ 7.14.1-7.14.20, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2005-16, adopted June 28, 2005; Ord. No. 2005-03, February 9, 2005. 

Sec. 7.14.1. - Applicability and scope. 
A.  Preliminary Land Development Regulations. This revised chapter of the Code of Ordinance resulted from a comprehensive evaluation and update of the Village's Sign Code which, prior to this revision, had remained substantially intact for a decade. Several workshops were held at a Village Council meeting level and the Planning and Zoning Board of Adjustment and Architectural Review Board levels as well as with local business and Chambers of Commerce to obtain input and advice for this new chapter's formulation. The Village has examined many of the deviations which have been periodically granted in order to develop a sign code that reduces an apparent need for consistent administrative relief. 
    In enacting this comprehensive revision, the Village has weighed and balanced various competing interests with two (2) enactment goals in mind: firstly, the new legislation will avoid the need to further amend the Village's sign law for a very long time (hopefully at least another decade) except when necessary to comply with evolving case law or court orders, and secondly, the new legislation will reduce dramatically the number of applications for site specific administrative relief. The Village's elected officers wish to thank the public, the Chamber of Commerce, the members of the Planning and Zoning Board, the Architectural Review Board, the Village's Planning, Zoning and Economic Development Departments, other Village staff, and specifically commenting developers and property owners for their contributions to this comprehensive legislative effort. 
B.  Purpose of intent. 
1.  Purpose. It shall be the purpose of this chapter to: 
a.  Promote and protect the general health, safety, welfare and community environment by establishing a comprehensive system for the regulation of signs;

h.  Preserve the beauty and unique landscape character of the Village of Wellington; 
i.  Directly advance the Village's interest in preserving and enhancing the Village's aesthetic appeal; 
j.  Ensure that signage is clear, compatible with the character of the adjacent architecture and provides the essential identify of, and direction to, facilities in the community; 
k.  Lessen hazardous conditions, confusion, and visual clutter that could be caused by the proliferation, unnecessary illumination, animation, and excessive height, area, and bulk of signs which would compete for the attention of the pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
l.  Establish sign regulations in general relationship to zoning classifications, building site size, size of buildings, and different types of frontage; 
m.  Permit reasonable amounts and avenues for communication of noncommercial and commercial messages by use of signs;

CHAPTER 15. - MAINTENANCE AND USE DOCUMENTS 

Sec. 7.15.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    This section is established to ensure that adequate ownership and maintenance measures will be provided in residential and other developments to protect and perpetually maintain all Common Areas or other required areas (including improvements located upon or within the Common Areas) required pursuant to this Code or other applicable Village ordinances or regulations. This section is also established to ensure the continued availability and utility of the Common Areas for the residents or occupants of the development and to prevent such facilities or the need for such facilities from becoming an unnecessary burden or nuisance to the Village or surrounding property. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating any obligation upon the Village to maintain such Common Areas or their improvements or to otherwise ensure their availability and condition. 
Sec. 7.15.2. - Applicability. 
    This section shall apply to all developments subject to review by the Development Review Committee as delineated elsewhere in this Code. Developments for which waivers of platting are administratively obtained shall also comply with the requirements of this section. 
Sec. 7.15.3. - Exception. 
    Generally, the maintenance and use documents requirement shall not apply to lands or improvements to be owned and maintained under a condominium or cooperative. The developer of any lands to be owned and maintained under a condominium or cooperative shall establish and regulate those in accordance with the requirements set forth by the State of Florida. If the condominium or cooperative is located within a Planned Unit Development, though, additional Village document requirements may apply. 
Sec. 7.15.4. - General Requirements. 
    A developer shall submit documents establishing maintenance and use of the Common Areas of a proposed development and other required areas at the point in the development process set forth in Article 8 Section 8.20 of this Code or as required as a condition of approval by any decision making or administrative body of the Village. All documents shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney's office prior to recording in the public records. The recording of the documents and all associated fees shall be the responsibility of the developer. All documents shall be recorded as approved by the Village Attorney's office, and copies of the recorded documents shall be submitted to the Village when requested. 
Sec. 7.15.5. - Documents Establishing Maintenance and Use. 
    The type of document required to establish use rights and responsibility for maintenance of the Common Areas of a development depends upon the nature of the development. 
A.  Developments including a subdivision of five (5) or more lots. A Property Owners' Association shall be required. Developer shall submit a Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions, Articles of Incorporation, and By-Laws. If there are to be party walls within the development, the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions shall include a Declaration of Party Wall. This requirement applies to both residential and non-residential developments. 
B.  Subdivisions of a maximum of four (4) lots. A Property Owners' Association may or may not be required depending upon the individual subdivision. The determination shall be made by the Village Attorney's Office. If a Property Owners' Association is required, then the submittal requirement shall be as listed above. If a Property Owners' Association is not required, then the Developer shall submit a Unity of Control. If there are to be party walls within the development, a Declaration of Party Wall shall be included in the submission.

No amendment that withdraws property from the terms of the Declaration shall be recorded unless approved in writing by the Village Attorney's office. No amendment inconsistent with the requirements of this section shall be recorded unless approved in writing by the Village Attorney's office.

    No owner of any parcel of land in a subdivision vacated and returned to acreage or abandoned by the owners shall be deprived by the reversion to acreage or abandonment of any part of the subdivision of reasonable access to such parcel nor to reasonable access therefrom to existing facilities to which such parcel has theretofore had access. Such access remaining or provided after such vacation and reversion or abandonment may not necessarily be the same as theretofore existing, but shall be reasonably equivalent thereto. 
Sec. 8.5.6. - Improvement of existing partially developed non-conforming subdivisions not subject to vacation and reversion to acreage by motion of the Board. 
    The improvement of non-conforming subdivisions not subject to vacation and reversion to acreage by motion of the Village Council shall comply with the requirements of this article and the following:

B.  Positive drainage. Positive drainage shall be established or its existence proven, meeting all requirements for connection to a point of legal positive outfall. Easements for proper drainage shall be provided where necessary at a width adequate to accommodate the drainage facilities, but in no case shall said easement width be less than twelve (12) feet. Where canals or ditches are permitted, the easement width shall be adequate to accommodate the full width of drainage facilities plus twenty (20) feet on one (1) side to permit access by equipment for maintenance purposes. 
CHAPTER 6. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 8.6.1. - General. 
    Any planned development which is to be subdivided shall comply with the requirements of this article after approval of a Final Subdivision Plan by the Development Review Committee pursuant to Sec. 5.6.

CHAPTER 7. - ALTERNATE DESIGNS FOR RURAL SUBDIVISIONS 

Sec. 8.7.1. - Applicability. 
    This section provides for a means of establishing a rural subdivision, as defined by this Code, in harmony with the character of surrounding development while meeting the general purpose and intent of this article. Due to the rural nature of proposed development, standard requirements for certain required improvements may be deemed inappropriate and alternative standards for such improvements may be approved under this section. 
Sec. 8.7.2. - Application requirements. 
    Upon submission of the subdivision plan, and an application for a rural subdivision designation, the Development Review Committee may approve the application for election to comply with this section. A rural subdivision shall meet the platting requirement of this article. 
Sec. 8.7.3. - Exceptions to requirements. 
    All requirements of this article shall apply except that the following required improvement design options shall be allowed under this section. 
A.  Access and circulation systems. Local streets may be developed without a wearing surface but shall otherwise conform to the standards specified by this article. All other streets of higher classification, as defined in this article, shall be constructed to meet or exceed County standards. Streets constructed without a wearing surface shall be privately maintained and shall not be considered for dedication or acceptance as public streets until paved, reconstructed and tested, as necessary, to meet Village or County Standards. Costs of maintenance and further development of the local streets in a rural subdivision shall be borne solely by the owners of the property within the subdivision. Sidewalks and bike paths shall not be required when local streets are constructed without a wearing surface. The developer and any subsequent owner/seller shall fully disclose to the purchaser the method of payment of costs of maintenance and improvements of local streets developed without a wearing surface. The developer shall adequately warrant, by recorded covenant, that the County will not be liable for cost of maintenance or further development of local streets constructed without a wearing surface. The method and form of said disclosures and covenants shall be subject to approval by the Village Attorney, prior to recordation of a final plat for such subdivision. 
B.  Wastewater system. Rural subdivisions within the Rural Service Area may utilize an individual system in accordance with Sec. 8.25. 
C.  Potable water system. Rural subdivisions within the Rural Service Area may utilize an individual system in accordance with Sec. 8.26.

CHAPTER 8. - PHASED DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 8.8.1. - Phasing plan. 
    The property encompassed by a Final Subdivision Plan may be developed in two (2) or more increments pursuant to the terms of this section and applicable phasing provisions of Sec. 5.9.4.C. A Final Subdivision Plan showing the proposed phasing plan must be approved by the Development Review Committee prior to submission of the first plat. Construction plans and preliminary plats shall coincide with their respective phases as shown on the Final Subdivision Plan. Construction plans or a preliminary plat for a partial phase shall not be accepted. 
Sec. 8.8.2. - Improvements. 
    The improvements of each phase shall be capable of operating independently of any unconstructed phase with respect to drainage, access, utilities, and other required improvements, except as provided herein. A dependent phase may be platted only if the foundation phase plat has been recorded and required improvements have been completed or are under construction pursuant to a land development permit and are secured pursuant to a guarantee posted for completion of required improvements. A dependent phase shall not be acknowledged as completed until the improvements in the foundation phase are acknowledged as completed; provided, however, that such acknowledgment of completion may occur simultaneously and provided that the Village Engineer may permit the posting of surety to guarantee the installation at a later time of those required improvements which are not deemed necessary to provide drainage, access, or utilities to such dependent phases. 
Sec. 8.8.3. - Certificate of Concurrency Reservation approval. 
    The phasing plan and all phased construction shall conform to any phasing plan approved under the Certificate of Concurrency Reservation. 
Sec. 8.8.4. - Phasing controls. 
    The phasing plan and all phased construction shall be completed in accordance with any phasing controls and time frames required by this Code which are applicable to the development. 
Sec. 8.8.5. - Time limitation. 
    When the Final Subdivision Plan is approved for development in phases requiring more than one (1) final plat, the duration of said approval shall be as specified by and subject to those provisions of Sec. 5.8 applicable to the development or phase thereof. 
Sec. 8.8.6. - Sequence of phases. 
    When the Final Subdivision Plan is to be constructed in phases, the following sequence must be adhered to: 
A.  Recreation areas. All required recreation areas and facilities to serve the entire development shall be platted or otherwise provided pursuant to the procedures and Chapter 38 of the Code of Ordinances. 
B.  Gross density. The gross density of an individual plat shall not exceed the maximum density permitted for the entire development unless the total of all previously recorded plats of record and the plat under review produces an average density less than or equal to the approved maximum density for the entire development. 
C.  Water management tracts. Where all or any portion of a water management tract is required to serve a proposed phase of development, and has not been previously recorded and constructed, said water management tract and its associated lake maintenance easement(s) shall be included and constructed in their entirety as part of the plat and required improvements for that phase.

1.  The division is to create no more than three (3) contiguous lots and all of the following circumstances apply: 
a.  The land concerned is isolated or removed in its relationship to platted lands; 
b.  Dedications or reservations are not required for the installation or maintenance of the required improvements; and 
c.  The improvements and dedications existing on the land are substantially in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
2.  The division is of a contiguous land area not exceeding eighty (80) acres into lots of at least ten (10) acres each and which area meets all of the following additional conditions: 
a.  The area to be subdivided has existing legal access via a street of local or higher classification, accepted for maintenance by a local governmental agency, a special district, or a legally incorporated property owners association; 
b.  Legal access to the proposed lots exists or will be established and dedicated to and be maintained by a property owners association or a special district; and 
c.  Legal positive outfall exists and the appurtenant drainage easements are dedicated to, maintained and accepted by either by a property owners' association or water control district. 
3.  The division consists of a change in lot lines for the purpose of combining lots or portions thereof, shown on a record plat, into no more than three (3) contiguous lots where each of the resulting lots meets the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan and this Code or reduces the degree of non-conformity to the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan and this Code, as applicable, and the establishment of streets or installation of improvements either would not be required pursuant to this article or would be required and their installation would be guaranteed by the developer pursuant to the provisions of this article. Provided, however, that any application hereunder for lands shown on a record plat recorded after February 3, 1973, shall be limited to those changes necessary to correct errors in the record plat or to make a lot line adjustment to accommodate an isolated instance of error in construction of a dwelling unit or other building. In such cases, the improvements shall be in compliance with the standards in effect at the time of recording the plat or with any approved variance to such standards.

a.  The total area of land encompassed by the antiquated subdivision; 
b.  The number of lots created within the antiquated subdivision; 
c.  The prior and subsequent subdivision of the area encompassed by the antiquated subdivision and whether such subdivision was platted or otherwise surveyed and placed of record; 
d.  The need for dedications or reservations to ensure installation and continued maintenance of the required improvements; 
e.  The extent of deviation from the requirements of this article; 
f.  The extent of ownership fragmentation, including the number of lots sold and the number of lots developed; 
g.  The degree of compliance with other Village land development regulations, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Plan and this Code; 
h.  The number of lots to be created; and 
i.  The extent of development in the surrounding area. 
5.  The combination or recombination of lots is required in order for the new lot or lots to meet the density requirements of the Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Decision by Village Engineer. In determining if platting may be waived, the Village Engineer shall distribute each application to, and consider recommendations received from the following agencies regarding conformance with requirements of their respective regulations and program responsibilities:

CHAPTER 22. - ACCESS AND CIRCULATION SYSTEMS 

Sec. 8.22.1. - Vehicular circulation systems. 
A.  Required improvement to be constructed by developer. All streets, required alleys, and related facilities required to serve the proposed development shall be constructed by the developer. Construction shall consist of, but not be limited to, grading, base preparation, surface course, and drainage. All streets, whether intended for dedication to the Village Council or reservation for private use and maintenance, shall be constructed to the minimum standards established by this article and the Village standards. Additionally, the developer shall construct any parking tracts which provide access to any clustered lots that do not have direct, primary access from a local street or residential access street. Construction of such parking tracts shall be completed prior to issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for any dwelling unit located on a clustered lot served by such parking tract. Construction of the parking tract may be done in conjunction with building construction on the lot the tract is to serve provided, however, that such construction shall be noted on the approved paving, grading and drainage plans in a form acceptable to the Village Engineer. When the parking tract is to be completed in conjunction with building construction, the developer shall execute a certificate of compliance on a form approved by the Building Director prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy for any dwelling unit or building served by such parking tract. Said certificate of compliance shall state that the parking tract was completed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 7.2. 
B.  Minimum legal access requirement. There is hereby established a hierarchy of legal access as shown on Chart 8.22-1. Except as provided below, each lot shall abut a street of suitable classification to provide said lot with legal access consistent with the standards set forth in Chart 8.22-2. 
1.  When legal access to a lot is permitted by this Code to be by a common parking area which serves more than one (1) lot, it shall be dimensioned and depicted on the construction plans and reserved on the plat as a "parking tract". Said tract shall be reserved for parking and access purposes to the property owners association having jurisdiction over the parking area and the abutting lots. 
2.  A common driveway may, with prior approval by the Village Engineer, be utilized for legal access to a group of not more than four (4) abutting lots situated adjacent to a curve on a residential access street where said lots would otherwise have no reasonable means of obtaining direct access to or required frontage on the adjacent residential access street. Said driveway shall be delineated and reserved on the applicable plat for purposes of perpetual access to the lots served. 
3.  A common parking lot may be utilized for legal access to individual lots created by subdivision of a shopping center or similar building site developed solely for commercial or industrial uses where all lots within the boundary of such subdivision are served by said access and are subject to recorded shared access, maintenance, and use covenants approved by the Village Attorney pursuant to Sec. 7.15. Where such access is utilized, direct lot access on any street adjacent to the boundary of the subdivision shall be prohibited except at common access points approved for the subdivision as a whole. 
C.  General design considerations. The proposed street layout shall be integrated with the Village's or County's traffic circulation network, and shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Streets shall be classified and designed in accordance with the Traffic Circulation Element of the Comprehensive Plan, Chart 8.22-2, and the Village standards. Consideration shall be given to: 
1.  The need for continuity of existing and planned streets; 
2.  Barriers imposed by topographical conditions and their effect on public convenience or safety; 
3.  The proposed use of the land to be served by such streets; 
4.  The need for continuation of existing local streets in adjoining areas not subdivided; 
5.  The proper projection of non-plan collector and plan collector streets; 
6.  The feasibility of extending the proposed street system to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to promote reasonable development of adjacent lands and to provide continuity of street systems; and 
7.  Discouraging through traffic in the design of local and residential access streets. 
D.  Double frontage lots. Where a lot has two (2) frontage lines, legal access to the lot shall be restricted as follows. 
1.  Residential lots. Where a lot abuts both a street of non-plan collector or higher classification and a local street, access to said lot shall be by the local street. The lot line(s) abutting any street of higher classification than a local street shall be buffered in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 8.29.2. 
2.  Non-residential lots. Where a lot abuts streets of local or higher classification, access to the lot shall be by the street of lower classification, unless otherwise permitted by this Code; provided, however, that access shall not be permitted on a local residential or residential access street as prescribed on Chart 8.22-2. 
E.  Construction in muck or clay areas. Construction in muck or clay areas shall be done in accordance with the Village Standards. 
F.  Street intersections and street jogs. The centerline intersections of local or residential access streets with non-plan or plan collector streets shall be spaced a minimum distance of two hundred (200) feet, as measured along the centerline of the collector street. Intersections which warrant traffic signalization shall be spaced a minimum distance of thirteen hundred twenty (1,320) feet, centerline to centerline. Connection of local streets to arterial streets may be permitted by the Village Engineer only where other access is unavailable. Local street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet are prohibited. 
G.  Through and local traffic. Through traffic shall be directed along non-plan collector streets within the subdivision. Local streets shall be laid out to accommodate local or neighborhood traffic and to discourage their use by through traffic. 
H.  Railroads in or abutting subdivisions. When a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way may be required at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of the intervening land. 
I.  Alleys. Alleys may be allowed in subdivisions when they are necessary, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, for the safe and convenient movement of traffic and pedestrians. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided and alleys shall be constructed in accordance with the following: 
1.  Residential areas. Alleys shall be paved ten-feet wide in a minimum twelve-foot right-of-way, with appropriate radii for the intended use. 
2.  Commercial and Industrial areas. Alleys shall be paved eighteen (18) feet wide in a minimum twenty-foot right-of-way, with appropriate radii for the intended use. 
J.  Bridges and culverts. Bridges or culverts shall be provided as necessary to facilitate the proposed vehicle and pedestrian system. The bridge or culvert requirement is subject to approval by the agency having jurisdiction over the facility being crossed. Bridges shall be designed in general accord with the current Department of Transportation practices and shall include planning for utility installation. They shall be reinforced concrete, unless other low maintenance materials are approved by the Village Engineer. Bridges shall have a clear roadway width between curbs two (2) feet in excess of the pavement width in each direction, and shall have sidewalks four (4) feet wide on each side. All bridge structures shall be designed for H-20-S-16-44 loading, incorporating adequate corrosion protection for all metal work and erosion protection for associated shorelines and embankments. 
K.  Street markers. Street markers shall be provided at each intersection in the type, size and location required by the current Village Standards. Street name signs shall carry the street name shown on the plat of record and shall be in compliance with the current Village standards. 
L.  Traffic control devices. The developer shall install traffic control devices and, where warranted, traffic signals on roads within and interfacing with the subdivision. A traffic impact analysis meeting the approval of the Village Engineer shall be used to assist in establishing the need for such signals. 
1.  Pavement markings and/or lane delineators. Pavement markings and/or lane delineators meeting the requirements of the Village or Palm Beach County, as appropriate, shall be installed on all arterial and collector streets. Pavement markings and/or delineators may be required on other streets such as project entrances, as determined by the Village Engineer. 
2.  Design. The design of traffic control devices shall be in accordance with the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices and applicable Village and Palm Beach County Standards. 
M.  Pavement widths. Pavement widths for streets shall be in accordance with Chart 8.22-2. 
N.  Dead-end streets. All dead end streets within the Village shall be designed and constructed to end in a cul-de-sac. The Village Engineer may approve an alternate turn around through the DRC process. Cul-de-sacs or other approved means of termini must be designated and constructed to meet the standards of both the Village of Wellington Land Development Regulations and the Palm Beach County Fire Code. Dead-end streets shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length except where natural geographic barriers exist necessitating a greater length. 
O.  Materials and construction. Pavement construction shall consist of, at a minimum, a subgrade, base and wearing surface. All materials and construction shall be in accordance with the current Village standards. 
P.  Shoulders. All unpaved shoulders shall be constructed and grassed in accordance with the Village standards. Grassing, with seed and mulch or with solid sod, as required, shall be completed prior to acknowledgement of completion of the required improvements by the Village Engineer. No time extensions to any contract for the construction of required improvement will be granted on the basis of incomplete shoulder treatment. 
Q.  Street grades. The longitudinal grade of street pavement shall be parallel to the design invert slope of the adjacent roadside drainage swale or gutter. Minimum longitudinal and transverse grades shall be in accordance with Village standards. Street grades shall be shown on the construction plans by indicating the direction and percent of slope. The horizontal distance along the centerline between, and pavement elevation at all points of vertical intersection shall also be shown. 
R.  Non-conforming streets. Streets which do not meet the design and constructions standards of this article and the Village Standards shall not be permitted except where satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street or reconstruction of the street in accordance with current standards is provided. Whenever a tract to be subdivided abuts an existing partial street, the other part of the street may be required to be dedicated and constructed within such tract. A proposed subdivision that includes an existing street which does not conform to the minimum street width requirements of these regulations shall provide for the dedication of additional land for such street along either one (1) or both sides of said street so that the minimum cross-section dimension requirements of these regulations can be met. The Village shall not accept non-conforming streets for ownership or maintenance through the procedures established by this article. 
S.  Limited access easements. Limited access easements shall be required along all non-plan collector streets and all major streets in order to control access to such streets from abutting property. Easements for controlling access to local and residential access streets may be required by the Village Engineer in order to ensure continued control of access to such streets from abutting property. All limited access easements shall be conveyed or dedicated to the Village. 
T.  Street names. Proposed streets which are in alignment with existing named streets should bear the name of the existing street. All street names shall have a suffix and in no case, except as indicated in the preceding sentence, should the name of the proposed street duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names. All proposed street names shall be submitted to the Director of Community Services for approval prior to submittal of the Final Subdivision Plan application. 
U.  Alignment, tangent, deflection, radii. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two (2) streets shall be prohibited. The point of curvature of any local street or residential access street shall not be closer than one hundred (100) feet to any intersection, measured along the centerline from the extension of the intersecting street lines. Reverse curves shall be prohibited. Reversals in alignment shall be connected by a straight tangent segment at least fifty (50) feet in length. All intersections shall be designed to provide at least the minimum stopping and turning sight distances, in accordance with criteria prescribed in the most recent edition of the FDOT Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. When the centerline of a local street deflects by more than ten (10) degrees, it shall be curved with a radius adequate to assure safe sight distance and driver comfort. Street pavement return radii shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet. 
V.  Street lighting. If street lighting is installed it shall be maintained by a property owners' association and said association should not be created exclusively for the purpose of maintaining street lighting. Unless street lighting installation conforms to the standards of the requisite utility company, street lights shall be placed outside of rights of way, road tracts, or any other areas designated for road purposes. Streets lighting shall be wired for underground service except where aerial service is permitted pursuant to Sec. 8.7.3 or Sec. 8.27.3. 
W.  Median strips. Median strips which are part of a public street may not be utilized for any purpose other than by the Village or public utility. However a developer or property owner may install landscaping in a median strip or within shoulders in accordance with Sec. 7.3.9 and permitting requirements as established by the Village Engineer pursuant to Palm Beach County Ord. 76-2, as amended, or other applicable codes or requirements. Median strips shall not be developed solely for the purpose of creating decorative entrances to subdivisions served by public streets. 
X.  Subdivision entranceways. Subdivision entranceways consisting of walls, fences, gates, rock piles or other entrance features are not permitted within the median strip or other areas in a public street. Decorative entranceways must be constructed upon plots of land adjacent to a public street in compliance with applicable Village codes and placed so as not to constitute a traffic hazard. 
Y.  Guardhouses. A guardhouse, located so as not to create a traffic hazard, may be constructed in the median of an entrance to a subdivision having only private streets. The minimum setback to a guardhouse shall be one hundred fifty (150) feet, measured from the extension of the intersecting street lines, unless waived by the Village Engineer. Two (2) lanes shall be required on each side of the median in the area of the guardhouse.

Sec. 8.22.2. - Pedestrian circulation system 
A.  Requirement for sidewalks. Except as provided in this section, sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets. For marginal access streets and streets with a width of less than fifty (50) feet and greater than thirty-two (32) feet, a sidewalk on one (1) side is required. No sidewalk is required in streets with a width of thirty-two (32) feet or less. Required sidewalks shall be constructed by the Developer except as provided in Sec. 8.21.1.A. 
B.  Master pedestrian circulation plan; waiver of requirement. The Development Review Committee may approve a Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan and, upon such approval, may waive, in whole or in part, the requirement for sidewalks within the street of a subdivision, or portion thereof, where it finds that the alternative pedestrian circulation system provides accessibility, convenience, continuity and safety equivalent to or greater than that which would be provided by the required sidewalks. The Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan shall be submitted by the developer for approval concurrently with, and shall be considered part of the approved Final Subdivision Plan. 
1.  Requirements for Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan. An application, the required fee, and the required number of copies of a Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan shall be submitted in accordance with Sec. 5.6. for placement on the agenda of the Development Review Committee. The Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan shall be a full-sized reproducible copy of the approved Final Subdivision Plan, and shall be modified, when necessary, to show: 
a.  The location of all lots and the number and type of dwelling units on each lot; 
b.  The classification and width of each street; 
c.  The location, width, and type of each pedestrian path, including those sidewalks and bicycle paths to be constructed within the streets; and 
d.  Locations of all connections to pedestrian systems outside the development. 
2.  Distribution of approved plan. Upon approval of a Master Pedestrian Circulation Plan, a copy of the approved plan shall be forwarded to the Village Engineer, Planning & Zoning Director, Building Director, and Metropolitan Planning Organization. 
C.  Maintenance responsibility of sidewalks and paths. The control, jurisdiction and maintenance obligation of paths not located wholly within a street and of sidewalks within private streets shall be placed with a property owners association or an improvement district. Where such control and maintenance obligation is to be placed with an improvement district, the district shall expressly accept said obligation upon the plat or by a separate instrument filed in the Public Records. 
Sec. 8.22.3. - Reduction of street width. 
    When pedestrian circulation is to be accomplished solely by paths constructed outside the streets, the Development Review Committee may approve a concurrent request by the developer to reduce local street widths from those required pursuant to Sec. 8.22.1.B by no more than eight (8) feet if such reduction would neither reduce the vehicular carrying capacity and safety of the streets nor compromise the safety of pedestrians. 
Sec. 8.22.4. - Crosswalks. 
    When the block length exceeds nine hundred (900) feet, crosswalks between streets may be required where deemed essential by the Village Engineer to provide convenient pedestrian circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.

Sec. 9.3.5. - Zones of Influence. 
A.  Maps. The Zones of Influence Maps, developed as described in Sec. 9.3.5.A.2., are incorporated herein and made a part of this Code. These Maps shall be on file and maintained by ERM. 
1.  Amendments. Any amendments, additions or deletions to said Maps shall be approved by the Village Council following written notice to property owners within the area covered by the amendment, addition, or deletion, and after public hearing. Written notice as provided herein shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing on the amendment, addition or deletion. Said maps shall be provided to any agency requesting said maps. 
2.  Basis. The Zones of Influence Maps are based upon travel time contours and one (1) foot drawdown contours. They are generated using a contaminant transport computer model that simulates pollutant movement using particles released around wells in an inverted head/velocity field. The head/velocity field is calculated by using finite difference computer modeling techniques that incorporate the effects of an extensive canal system and Year 2010 build out pumpage rates. The pumping rates were determined by first projecting population figures for the Year 2010 for each public utility service area and multiplying this by a per capita consumption rate determined by the SFWMD and by consultation with public utilities regarding wellfield expansion and development. 
3.  Review. The Zones of Influence Maps shall be reviewed at least on an annual basis. However, failure to conduct said review shall not affect the validity of the existing approved Maps. The basis for updating said Maps may include, but is not limited to, the following. 
a.  Changes in the technical knowledge concerning the applicable aquifer. 
b.  Changes in the pumping rate of wellfields. 
c.  Wellfield reconfiguration. 
d.  Designation of new wellfields. 
4.  Boundaries. The Zones of Influence indicated on the Zones of Influence Maps are as follows: 
a.  Zone One (1). The land area situated between the well(s) and the thirty-day travel time contour. 
b.  Zone Two (2). The land area situated between the thirty (30) day and the two hundred ten-day travel time contours. 
c.  Zone Three (3). The land area situated between the two hundred ten (210) day and the five hundred-day travel time contours. 
d.  Zone Four (4). The land area situated beyond the five hundred-day travel time contour and within the one-foot drawdown contour. 
5.  Interpretation of boundaries. In determining the location of properties and facilities within the zones depicted on the Zones of Influence Maps, the following rules shall apply. 
a.  Properties located wholly within one (1) Zone reflected on the applicable Zones of Influence Maps shall be governed by the restrictions applicable to that Zone. 
b.  To that the extent Sec. 9.3.5.C. does not apply, properties having parts lying within more than one (1) Zone as reflected on the applicable Zones of Influence Maps shall be governed by the restrictions applicable to the zone in which the part of the property is located. 
c.  Where a travel time contour which delineates the boundary between two (2) Zones of Influence passes through a facility, the entire facility shall be considered to be in the more restrictive zone. 
d.  Where the facility, or portion thereof, is overlapped by Zones of Influence of different wells or wellfields, the stricter zones shall apply. 
6.  Reference raw water analyses to be completed for each well. A reference set of raw water analyses shall be completed for each well for which a Zone of Influence Map has been established. Said analyses shall be completed within one hundred eighty-five (185) days after March 7, 1988, for existing wells. A copy of the analytical report shall be forwarded to ERM and the PBCPHU within fourteen (14) days of completion. For any new well, this set of analyses shall be completed prior to the release of the well into service by the PBCPHU and ERM. Said analyses shall address inorganic priority pollutants as listed in Appendix 9.3.4. and organic pollutants as listed in Chapter 17-550 F.A.C. and as shown in Appendix 9.3.4. The cost shall be borne by the utility. The analytical reports shall be prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory, certified for the applicable analyses. Samples shall be taken by the State certified laboratory performing the analyses, or its authorized representative. 
B.  Protection of future wellfields. The prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this section and in regulations promulgated pursuant hereto shall apply to any sites officially designated by the Village Council as future wellfields. Such prohibitions and restrictions shall become effective upon approval by the Village Council of the Zones of Influence Maps for the designated future wellfield. Prior to final action by the Village Council in designating a future wellfield or approving the Zones of Influence Maps for those wellfields, all property owners and discernable operating activities within the area affected shall receive written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed public hearing at which the action shall be considered.

The owner/operator may choose to provide adequate and appropriate liquid collection methods rather than sheltering only after approval of the design by ERM. These requirements shall apply to all areas of use, production, and handling, to all storage areas, to loading and off-loading areas, and to above-ground and underground storage areas. The containment devices and liquid collection systems shall be certified in the operating permit application by the Professional Engineer or Professional Geologist registered or licensed in the State of Florida. 
ii.  Emergency collection devices. Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials or other devices approved by ERM, shall be present on-site or available within two (2) hours (one hour in Zone One (1)) by contract with a clean up company approved by ERM, in sufficient magnitude so as to control and collect the total quantity of Regulated Substances present. To the degree feasible, emergency containers shall be present and of such capacity as to hold the total quantity of Regulated Substances plus absorbent material. The presence of such emergency collection devices shall be certified in the operating permit application for existing activities. Such certification for new activities shall be provided to ERM prior to the presence of Regulated Substances on the site. Certification shall be provided by a Professional Engineer or Professional Geologist registered or licensed in the State of Florida. 
iii.  Emergency plan. An emergency plan shall be prepared and filed with the operating permit application indicating the procedures which will be followed in the event of spillage of a Regulated Substance so as to control and collect all such spilled material in such a manner as to prevent it from reaching any storm or sanitary drains or the ground. 
iv.  Inspection. A responsible person designated by the permittee who stores, handles, uses or produces the Regulated Substances shall check on every day of operation, for breakage or leakage of any container holding the Regulated Substances. Electronic sensing devices may be employed as part of the inspection process, if approved by ERM, and provided the sensing system is checked daily for malfunctions. The manner of daily inspection shall not necessarily require physical inspection of each container provided the location of the containers can be inspected to a degree which reasonably assures ERM that breakage or leakage can be detected by the inspection. Monitoring records shall be kept and made available to ERM at all reasonable times for examination. 
v.  Proper and adequate maintenance of containment and emergency equipment. Procedures shall be established for quarterly, in-house inspection and maintenance of containment and emergency equipment.

vii.  Monitoring for Regulated Substances in the potable water well. Arrangements shall be made with the designated public utility to establish a semi-annual schedule of raw water analysis unless sampling results indicate contamination, in which case ERM shall require an increased sampling schedule. The analysis shall be for all substances which are listed on the operating permit. The analytical reports shall be prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory, certified for the applicable analyses. It shall be the responsibility of the designated public utility to provide for the sampling and analyses but the cost shall be borne by the permittee or those permittees on a pro-rata basis as to the same substances listed on the permits of those permittees in Zones of Influence of the subject well. Samples shall be taken by the State certified laboratory performing the analyses, or its authorized representative. 
Semi-annual reports prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory of the analyses for Regulated Substances shall be submitted to ERM for the purpose of determining the presence of Regulated Substances in each well for which a Zone of Influence Map has been established. 
viii.  Monitoring for Regulated Substances in groundwater monitoring wells. Groundwater monitoring well(s) shall be provided at the expense of the permittee in a manner, number and location approved by ERM. Except for existing wells found by ERM to be adequate for this provision, the required well or wells shall be installed by a State of Florida licensed water well contractor. Samples shall be taken by the State certified laboratory performing the analyses, or its authorized representative. Analytical reports prepared by a State of Florida certified laboratory of the quantity present in each monitoring well of the Regulated Substances listed in the activity's operating permit shall be filed at least semi-annually, or more frequently, as determined by ERM, based upon site conditions and operations. 
ix.  Alterations and expansion. ERM shall be notified in writing prior to the expansion, alteration or modification of an activity holding an operating permit. Such expansion, alteration, or modification may result from increased square footage of production or storage capacity, or increased quantities of Regulated Substances, or changes in types of Regulated Substances beyond those square footages, quantities, and types upon which the permit was issued. Should a facility add new Regulated Substances which individually are below the non-aggregate limits identified in the definition of "Regulated Substance", it shall notify ERM on the annual basis of the types and quantities of such substances added and the location of the use, handling, storage, and production of said substances. Any such expansion, alteration or modification shall be in strict conformity with this section. Further, except as provided herein, any existing operating permit shall be amended to reflect the introduction of any new Regulated Substances resulting from the change. However, the introduction of any new Regulated Substance shall not prevent the revocation or revision of any existing operating permit if, in the opinion of ERM, such introduction substantially or materially modifies, alters or affects the conditions upon which the existing operating permit was granted or the ability to remain qualified as a general exemption, if applicable, or to continue to satisfy any conditions that have been imposed as part of a special exemption, if applicable. ERM shall notify the permittee in writing within sixty (60) days of receipt of the permittee's notice that ERM proposes to revoke or revise the permit and stating the grounds therefore. 
x.  Reconstruction after catastrophe. Reconstruction of any portion of a structure or building in which there is any activity subject to the provisions of this regulation which is damaged by fire, vandalism, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war or other catastrophe shall be in strict conformity with this section. 
xi.  Revocation or revision for spill. Within thirty (30) days of acquiring knowledge of any spill of a Regulated Substance, ERM shall consider revocation or revision of the permit. In consideration of whether to revoke or revise the permit, ERM may consider the intentional nature or the degree of negligence, if any, associated with the spill, the extent to which containment or cleanup is possible, the nature, number and frequency of previous spills by the permittee and the potential degree of harm to the groundwater and surrounding wells due to such spill.

"Best Management Practices" for the Construction Industry 
A.  The general Contractor, or if none, the property owner, shall be responsible for assuring that each contractor or subcontractor evaluates each site before construction is initiated to determine if any site conditions may pose particular problems for the handling of any Regulated Substances. For instance, handling Regulated Substances in the proximity of water bodies or wetlands may be improper. 
B.  If any regulated substances are stored on the construction site during the construction process, they shall be stored in a location and manner which will minimize any possible risk of release to the environment. Any storage container of fifty-five (55) gallons, or four hundred forty (440) pounds, or more containing Regulated Substances shall have constructed below it an impervious containment system constructed of materials of sufficient thickness, density and composition that will prevent the discharge to the land, groundwaters, or surface waters, of any pollutant which may emanate from said storage container or containers. Each containment system shall be able to contain one hundred fifty (150) percent of the contents of all storage containers above the containment system. 
C.  Each contractor shall familiarize him/herself with the manufacturer's safety data sheet supplied with each material containing a Regulated Substance and shall be familiar with procedures required to contain and clean up any releases of the Regulated Substance. Any tools or equipment necessary to accomplish same shall be available in case of a release. 
D.  Upon completion of construction, all unused and waste Regulated Substances and containment systems shall be removed from the construction site by the responsible contractor and shall be disposed of in a proper manner as prescribed by law.

Sec. 11.6.6. - Criteria to Determine Whether Development Is Continuing in Good Faith. 
A.  Definitions. Continuing in good faith shall mean, and consideration shall be made of, diligent efforts directed toward achieving the ultimate development, marketing, and use of the land, in accordance with the development order(s). Diligent efforts shall require reasonable and timely pursuit of all necessary approvals, certifications and permits; financing; and marketing, together or in a sequence customary to the industry. Factors militating against a finding of diligent efforts shall be delays occasioned by any person holding a legal or equitable interest in the property, its agents, contractors, or employees acting on behalf of the owner; marketing of the entire project as a whole, unless the project is of such a nature or size that it can only feasibly be marketed as a single unit; the discontinuation of attempts at obtaining required approvals, certifications, and permits; the discontinuation of a construction activity (including clearing, grubbing, filling, excavating, placement of infrastructure, and building construction) prior to the completion of the particular construction activity; delay of proceeding toward the next customary phase of construction activity; the discontinuation of design work; the discontinuation of sales or leasing efforts; the removal of construction personnel, facilities, and equipment from the project; the delay of proceeding with the next phase of development. 
1.  The following shall not be considered as factors militating against a finding of proceeding in good faith: (a) delays caused solely by government action or inaction; (b) delays caused by administrative, quasi-judicial or judicial proceedings, which prevent development from occurring; and (c) delays caused by natural disaster or acts of God. 
2.  The economic state of the development industry economy shall be considered only as related to the Village region and the development industry as a whole and not a particular market segment. Economic conditions shall only be considered for purposes of determining customary practices of local developers as a measure of the diligence and good faith of the Applicant. 
3.  Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary within this Article VII, Development shall be deemed to be continuing in good faith as to a Lot which has been granted a Concurrency Exemption pursuant to appropriate Village codes or Palm Beach County Ordinance 89-35 within a validly divided area which has a Local Government Development Order. Good faith may be presumed provided that all Site Improvements required by the Local Government Development Order, or as required by the Village Subdivision Code, as a condition to obtaining a building permit upon the Lot have been installed, and that Development activity in the nature of the construction of new single family residences has taken place since the granting of the exemption or the extension thereof upon other Lots within the area. 
B.  Considerations. In determining whether development is proceeding in good faith, the Village shall recognize that land development is a complex task involving a series of governmental approvals. Recognizing this, the following factors shall be considered where relevant: 
1.  The number and type of development orders applied for or received since the exemption certificate was issued. 
2.  The relationship of the development orders to other development orders in the sequence of development orders required. 
3.  Was each development order received within the required time-frame or were time extensions necessary. 
4.  Were time extensions granted and how many? 
5.  What, if any, development activity was commenced during each respective time extension? 
6.  Whether needed permits/approvals (Village, county and others) were actively and continuously pursued. 
7.  The of development orders remaining which are needed to complete the land development. 
8.  The time customarily associated with obtaining various development orders. 
9.  The percentage of development permitted and completed during the concurrency exemption or extension period compared to the size of the project and the historic average percent of development completed each year. 
10.  The overall extent and type of development commenced and completed as related to the project's size and use. 
11.  If the project is phased, were the dates of each phase met. 
12.  Conditions placed by the Village in issuing the development order. 
13.  Whether any special exception conditions of approval limited or phased the amount of construction due to conditions beyond the property owner's control. 
14.  Fulfillment of special exception time certain conditions of approval, if any. 
15.  The marketing practices associated with the project; e.g. whether the entire Project is being marketed as a whole for sale. 
16.  The reasonable development time-line of that type and size of development. 
17.  The number and type of contractors, engineers, consultants, tradesman, and professionals working on the project, and their respective activities. 
18.  Whether any delay was caused by government changing an approved time plan for commencement of construction of infrastructure. 
C.  Section 5.8 Compliance with Time Limitations. Rezoning, revocation of a special exception, Class "A"' or "B" conditional use, or limiting development intensity or density to entitlement by the Village Council pursuant to Article 5, Chapter 8 of this Code shall be prima facie evidence that the development is not continuing in good faith and any exemption or extension thereto shall be automatically revoked. 
Sec. 11.6.7. - Approved Residential Projects Holding Concurrency Exemption Certificates. 
    For the following types of residential developments, the Planning & Zoning Director may initiate an application for a currency extension certificate provided the project received a concurrency exemption certificate properly issued pursuant to Ordinance 89-35, as amended and the following criteria are met: 
A.  Platted subdivision. A platted subdivision, if all required improvements have been installed or guaranteed. 
B.  Planned unit development. Planned unit development, if platting schedule is maintained. 
C.  Phased subdivisions. Phased subdivision, if plats are recorded in accordance with an approved phasing schedule. 
Sec. 11.6.8. - Approved Non-Residential Projects Holding Concurrency Exemption Certificates. 
    For the following types of non-residential developments, the Planning & Zoning Director may initiate an application for a concurrency extension certificate provided the project received a concurrency exemption certificate issued pursuant to Ordinance 89-35, as amended and the following criteria are met: 
    A platted non-residential parcel, if all required improvements associated with the plat have been installed or guaranteed. 
Sec. 11.6.9. - Administrative Appeal. 
A.  General.

CHAPTER 3. - PROJECT BUILDOUT STANDARD 

Sec. 15.3.1. - Generally. 
    There is hereby established a Vehicular Traffic Performance Standard for all Wellington Roadways as Identified on the Wellington Roadway Analysis Map Except as specifically provided in this Article, no Development Order shall be issued which is not in compliance with this standard. The Project Buildout test (Test) relates to the Buildout Period of the Project and requires that the Project demonstrate that no significant Traffic is added which would cause the Total Traffic to exceed the Adopted Level of Service at the end of the Buildout Period. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.3.2. - Project Buildout Test. 
A.  Project Buildout Test-Parts One and Two. No Project shall be approved for Development Order unless it can be shown to satisfy the requirement of Parts One and Two of the Project Buildout Test as outlined below. 
1.  Part One-Intersections. This Part requires analysis of Wellington Intersections where a Project's traffic is significant on a Link For purposes of this Part One, Wellington Intersections also includes intersections of a Wellington Roadway and a non Wellington Roadway or other point of access where: 1) the intersection is signalized or where projected traffic volumes warrant a signal; and 2) the non Wellington approach is projected to carry at least two hundred (200) two-way, peak hour trips and, 3) the non-Wellington approach represents twenty (20) percent or more of the intersection critical sum volume. 
a.  The following Wellington intersections shall be analyzed: 
1)  The Wellington Intersections in each direction nearest to the point at which the Project's Traffic enters each Project Accessed Link, and where the Project Traffic entering or exiting the intersection from/to the Project Accessed Link is significant. The intersections analyzed shall not exceed two (2) intersections per Project Accessed Link. 
2)  For a Project on Southern Boulevard, the Single Point Urban Interchange(s) on Southern Blvd. where it is the nearest Intersection to the point at which the Project's Traffic enters the Project Accessed Link and where the Project Traffic entering and exiting the intersection is significant. For purposes of determining significance of the traffic entering and exiting the intersection, the traffic entering and exiting the ramps shall be considered against the combined LOS D capacity of the ramps, which shall be four thousand two hundred (4,200) vehicles per hour. 
3)  All Wellington Intersections where the Project Traffic comprises ten (10) percent or more of the Total Traffic on at least one approach. 
4)  All Wellington Intersections where links are operating at eighty (80) percent or greater of LOS D and where the project has a significant on any approach. 
b.  For signalized intersections the intersection analysis shall be conducted using the HCM Operational Analysis using the most recent version of the HCM. 
1)  The HCM Operational Analysis shall comply with the default input values published by the County Engineer no more frequently than twice per year. Revisions to the input values may be made subject to approval by the County Engineer to reflect actual or projected field conditions where substantial differences from the published values can be demonstrated. 
2)  For intersections outside the Equestrian Overlay Zoning District (EOZD), if the intersection average total delay is at or below the thresholds identified in Table 15.3.B-1B, the Project passes Part One of the Project Buildout Test and continues with the Part Two-Link Analysis. If the intersection average total delay exceeds the thresholds identified in Table 15.3.B-1B, the Project fails Part One. 
3)  For intersections within the EOZD, if the intersection average total delay is at or below the thresholds identified in Table 15.3.B-2B, the Project passes Part One of the Project Buildout Test and continues with the Part Two-Link Analysis. If the intersection average total delay exceeds the thresholds identified in Table 15.3.B-2B, the Project fails Part One. 
4)  The Applicant may make intersection improvements in accordance with published Wellington, Palm Beach County or Florida Department of Transportation Design and Traffic Engineering Standards, as applicable, in order to satisfy Part One. 
c.  For unsignalized Wellington Intersections, the intersections shall be analyzed using the most recent version of the HCM Unsignalized Intersection Analysis and all minor movements of Rank 2 or higher shall operate at LOS E or better. In addition, a signal warrant analysis with Total Traffic for the intersection may be required by the Village Engineer. 
1)  If a minor movement is not projected to operate at LOS E or better, then the applicant may make intersection improvements in accordance with applicable Wellington, Palm Beach County or FDOT Design Standards to satisfy the LOS standard. If these improvements require signalization of the intersection and if signalization is expected to be warranted at any time up to twenty-four (24) months after the Project's final certificate of occupancy, then the Project may also be required to fund signalization. If, with these improvements, all minor movements of Rank 2 or higher will operate at LOS E or better, the Project passes Part One. 
2)  If no geometric intersection improvements are determined to be feasible by the Village Engineer, then the applicant shall agree to fund signalization of the intersection if warranted at any time up to twenty-four (24) months after the Project's final certificate of occupancy and if it meets access management standards. If the applicant is not willing to agree to fund signalization of the intersection if warranted, the Project fails Part One. 
d.  Where a CRALLS (Constrained Roadway at a Lower Level of Service volume has been adopted by Palm Beach County for one (1) or more of the LINKs that constitute the legs of the intersection, the allowable service volume for the intersection shall be calculated as follows: Allowable CRALLS intersection volume = [sum of CRALLS Link volume(s) or LINK LOS D volumes (for those LINKS without CRALLS), whichever is applicable, for all legs of intersection/(sum of Link LOS D volume(s) for all legs of intersection)] × 1400. 
2.  Part Two-Links. 
a.  This Part requires analysis of Wellington Roadways and Intersections as necessary where a Project's traffic is significant on a Link. The Total Traffic in the peak hour on the Link shall be compared to applicable thresholds in Table 15.3.B-1A, The LOS D Link Service Volumes, Peak Hour Directional Traffic volume threshold. The applicable facility class for each Link shall be determined on the basis of the posted speed limit and/or number of traffic signals per mile anticipated by the Village Engineer to be in place by the buildout time frame of the proposed Project being evaluated. Additionally, for all Links where the Total Traffic peak hour directional volumes exceed the applicable threshold the Wellington Intersections on each end of the Link shall be analyzed. If the Link is on Southern Boulevard, the at-grade intersection created by an Urban Interchange shall not be considered the intersection at the end of the link since the intersection is actually not on Southern Boulevard. The Project shall include the next intersection with Southern Boulevard for analysis and compliance. 
The project shall pass Part Two, for links outside the EOZD, if: 
The Total Traffic peak hour directional volume on the Link is less than the applicable thresholds in Table 15.3.B-1B: LOS D Link Service Volumes. 
The project shall pass Part Two, for links within the EOZD, if: 
The Total Traffic peak hour directional volume on the Link is less than the applicable thresholds in Table 15.3.B-2B: LOS D Link Service Volumes. 
For Links where the Total Traffic peak hour directional volumes exceed the applicable threshold, where the Buildout period is five years or fewer, and where the intersections at the end of the failing link are less than or equal to the Delay Thresholds, as applicable, in Table 15.3.B-1B or Table 15.3.B-2B a more detailed analysis as outlined in the Optional Analysis may be completed to demonstrate compliance with Part Two. 
For Links where the Total Traffic peak hour directional volumes exceed the applicable threshold and where the Buildout period is greater than five years or where the intersections at the end of the failing link are greater than the Delay Thresholds, as applicable, in Table 15.3.B-1B or Table 15.3.B-2B, the Project fails Part Two. 
b.  Optional Analysis-The HCM Arterial Analysis Operational methodology shall be conducted. For these Links outside the EOZD, the Project shall demonstrate that the Total Traffic peak hour directional volumes do not result in an average speed on the Segment that is lower than the speed thresholds for LOS D as defined in Table 15.3.B-1C. LOS D. Speed Thresholds. If the speed is equal to or higher than the LOS D speed threshold, then the Project shall pass Part Two. If the speed is lower than the LOS D speed threshold, then the Project fails Part Two. For these Links within the EOZD, the Project shall demonstrate that the Total Traffic peak hour directional volumes do not result in an average speed on the Segment that is lower than the speed thresholds for LOS E as defined in Table 15.3.B-2C, LOS E. Speed Thresholds. If the speed is equal to or higher than the LOS E speed threshold, then the Project shall pass Part Two. If the speed is lower than the LOS E speed threshold, then the Project fails Part Two. 
c.  The Applicant may make link or intersection improvements in accordance with published Wellington, Palm Beach County or Florida Department of Transportation Design and Traffic Engineering Standards, as applicable, in order to satisfy Part Two.

a.  Rates. Trip generation rates presented in the County's Impact Fee Ordinance shall be used to calculate Average Daily project trips. For peak hour Project trip generation and where no appropriate Daily rates are listed in the County's Impact Fee Ordinance, the rate equation or tables published in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation and Informational Report shall be used unless the Village Engineer accepts that other standards provide a more accurate means to evaluate the rates of generation or if documentation is supplied by the applicant which affirmatively demonstrates more accurate generation rates based on accepted engineering principles. 
b.  Local Conditions-The County and/or Village Engineer may publish, and update from time to time, trip generation rates for local conditions and, if applicable, these rates shall be used instead of the ITE rates. 
c.  Similar Developments-Actual traffic counts which establish the generation rate at three (3) similar developments located in similar areas as the one proposed may be used if approved by the Village Engineer in accordance with accepted traffic engineering principles. These counts shall be made for the weekdays and/or weekends, as necessary, (excluding legal holidays) as set forth in paragraph (1.a) for each site and averaged. 
d.  Internal Traffic-It is acknowledged that some trips generated by mixed use Projects do not exit the Project or enter the Wellington Roadway system. Unless approved by the Village Engineer, credit against the trip generation of a proposed Project shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross trip generation of the Project, not including internalization between Service Station and Convenience Store uses. Additionally, credit for any individual land use within the proposed Project shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross trip generation for the land use, except as provided herein. Internalization between Service Station and Convenience Store uses is established at thirty-two (32) percent of the gross trip generation of the Convenience Store use. 
e.  Pass by Trips-It is acknowledged that some trips generated by a proposed non-residential Project are from existing traffic passing the proposed Project and are not newly generated trips. Credit against the trip generation of the proposed Project may be taken for these trips up to the percentage shown in the County's Impact Fee Ordinance or the ITE manual when approved by the Village Engineer. The study must detail: (1) all traffic generated from the Project, and (2) the number of Pass-By Trips subtracted from the traffic generated by the Project during the Buildout Period of the Project. Uses other than those listed in County's Impact Fee Ordinance and any percentage credit proposed to be taken in excess of that shown in County's Impact Fee Ordinance must be justified based on accepted traffic engineering principles to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer as part of the required traffic study, based upon the peculiar characteristics and location of the proposed Project. Factors which should be considered in determining a different Pass-by rate include type and size of land use, location with respect to service population, location with respect to competing uses, location with respect to the surrounding Wellington Roadway system, and existing and projected traffic volumes. In no case shall the number of Pass-By Trips exceed twenty-five (25) percent of Existing traffic plus Background Traffic on the Link, unless demonstrated otherwise to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer based on generally accepted traffic engineering principles. 
3.  Traffic Assignment. Total Traffic shall be computed, and traffic assignments of the Net Peak Hour Directional Trips made, for each Wellington Roadway Link and Intersection in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles. The assignments shall address phasing and cover the Buildout Period of the Project. 
4.  Background Traffic. 
a.  Generally. Existing traffic volumes will likely change during the Buildout Period of the proposed project. The traffic study must account for this change in traffic based on Background Traffic during the Buildout Period of the proposed project. The projection of Background Traffic shall generally be based upon the information set forth in the County's TPS Database and on the Historical Traffic Growth Rate Tables, and shall be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this Article and accepted engineering principles. This change in traffic shall be shown as it relates to the proposed phasing. The Projection of Background Traffic during the Buildout Period of the proposed Project shall be subject to the review and approval of the Village Engineer, using the following criteria: 
1)  Historical growth shown on tables prepared by the County Traffic Division and/or Village Engineer; 
2)  Characteristics of growth in the area 
3)  Extent of existing, approved, and anticipated development in the area 
4)  Types and sizes of development in the area; 
5)  Traffic circulation in the area; 
6)  Committed Projects' impact; 
7)  New and assured road construction. 
b.  Historical Growth Rate Tables. Using the Historical Growth Rate Tables prepared by the County Traffic Division and/or the Village Engineer, the study shall forecast the change in traffic volumes based on Background Traffic within the proposed project's Radius of Development Influence during the Buildout Period of the proposed project. The Historical Growth Rate Tables shall be based on historical daily traffic volumes. However, the growth rates shall be applied on a Peak Season, Peak-Hours Directional basis The effect of committed projects shall be considered in projecting the increase or decrease in traffic volumes so as to ensure that there is no double counting or omission in Background Traffic. In using the historical growth tables, engineering judgment shall be used to take into account special circumstances such as the opening of a parallel road or a high traffic generation that may distort the growth trend. For projects with a lengthy buildout time (five (5) years or more) an area wide growth rate using a number of locations in the tables may be appropriate. No growth rate less than zero (0) percent may be used without approval of the Village Engineer when the growth rate is a negative. 
c.  TPS Database. Using the County's TPS Database, all traffic from the unbuilt portion of Projects which have received a concurrency reservation prior to the County Engineer's approval of the proposed Project's traffic study which will add significant trips to any Link within the area surrounding the proposed Project's during the Buildout Period of proposed Project shall be specifically accounted for in projecting Traffic. For Wellington intersections, the TPS Database shall specifically account for all Project Traffic volumes if at least one approach to the intersection has a Project Traffic volume greater than or equal to one (1) percent of the adopted LOS D. No double counting of trips shall occur. A comparison of the traffic projection using historic growth with traffic projections using the County's TPS database plus a nominal growth rate per year shall be completed. 
It is recognized that errors and omissions may occur in the TPS Database which may need to be accounted for in a traffic study. The traffic study shall be amended to include any correction of errors or omissions in the TPS database, so long as either the engineer preparing the traffic study or the Village Engineer or County notifies the other party within thirty (30) days of the initial submission of the traffic study and the error or omission should have been included in the database prior to the date of the initial submission of the traffic study. 
5.  Assured Construction. Assured Construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the study. Whether it is in fact Assured Construction and the timing of the Assured Construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the Village Engineer. The Traffic Impact Study shall specifically identify the need for phasing based on Assured Construction. 
6.  Project Phasing. The traffic study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place traffic impacts on the Wellington Roadways and Intersections and shall include the following: 
a.  Generation. Project traffic figures and assignments for each proposed phase; and 
b.  Assured Construction. Where the evaluation of phased traffic impact includes the effect of Assured Construction, sufficient information regarding the proposed construction to ensure that the roadways realistically will be constructed at the times stated. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.4.5. - Site Related Improvements. 
    In addition to the LINK and intersection standards and studies, all peak hour(s) turning movements (including Pass-by trips) shall be shown and analyzed using the analysis in the latest Highway Capacity Manual for all points where the project's traffic meets the Directly Accessed Links and other roads where traffic control or geometric changes may be needed, as determined by the Village Engineer. Recommendations shall be made concerning signalization and turn lanes to ensure the safe and orderly flow of traffic.

CHAPTER 5. - PROPORTIONATE SHARE PROGRAM 

Sec. 15.5.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the Proportionate Share Program, as required by and in a manner consistent with § 163.3180, F.S. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.2. - Applicability. 
    The Proportionate Share Program shall apply to all Projects that fail to meet the standards of this Article on an intersection or roadway. The Proportionate Share Program does not apply to projects exempted from this Article. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.3. - General Requirements. 
A.  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the Village by making a proportionate share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
1.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
2.  The roadway improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS is feasible within the ultimate right-of-way planned for that facility. 
B.  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's proportionate share obligation must meet the Village design standards for locally maintained roadways. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.4. - Submittal Process. 
A.  In the event of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall have the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the Proportionate Share Program pursuant to the requirements of Section 15.5.3. 
B.  Eligible applicants shall submit a request to utilize the Proportionate Share Program as part of their Traffic Impact Study to the Village Engineer. 
C.  When a submittal is deemed sufficient, complete, and approved, a proposed proportionate share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the Village. 
D.  No proportionate share agreement will be effective until approved by the Village Council. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.5. - Determining Proportionate Fair-Share Obligation. 
A.  Proportionate share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
B.  A Project eligible for participation under the Proportionate Share Program shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate share. The fair market value of the proportionate share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
C.  The methodology used to calculate a Project's proportionate share obligation shall be as provided for in § 163.3180, F.S., as follows: 
The number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour directional maximum service volume of roadways and or intersections resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain or achieve the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain or achieve the adopted LOS. 
OR 
Proportionate Share = S[[(Development Trips i )/(SV Increase i )] × Cost i ] 
Where: 
Development Trips = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment or intersection "i" and have triggered a deficiency per TPS. 
SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment or intersection "i" per Section 3. 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering review, inspection, administration, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost, including contingencies, in the year it will be incurred. 
D.  If the Village has accepted an improvement proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the Village Engineer or other method approved by the Village Engineer. 
E.  If the Village has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate share payment, credit for the dedication of the right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at one hundred twenty (120) percent of the most recent assessed value by the Property Appraiser, or at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the Village at no expense to the Village. This appraisal shall assume no approved development plan for the site. All right-of-way dedicated must be part of a roadway segment that triggered the deficiency per TPS, and must not be site-related. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the Village at no expense to the Village. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant based on a Village approved appraisal is more than the Village estimated total proportionate share obligation for the development, then the Village will give the applicant additional road impact fee credit for the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.6. - Impact Fee Credit for Proportionate Share Mitigation. 
A.  Proportionate share contributions shall be applied as a credit against road impact fees. 
B.  Impact fee credits for the proportionate share contribution will be determined when the road impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the Proportionate Share Agreement as they become due. Once the credit has been exhausted, payment of road impact fees shall be required for each permit issued. The impact fee credit shall be established when the proportionate share contribution is received by the Village. 
C.  The proportionate share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed project. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate share contributions for a proposed project cannot be transferred to any other project. 
(Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1(Att. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 15.5.7. - Proportionate Share Agreements. 
A.  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement ("Agreement"), the applicant shall receive a certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within twelve (12) months, then the Agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
B.  In the event an Agreement requires the applicant to build one or more road improvements, all such improvements must be commenced prior to issuance of the phased development permit and assured by a binding agreement that is accompanied by a Performance Security sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this Section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of phased certificates of occupancy. 
C.  Dedication of necessary R-O-W for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the phased building permit. 
D.  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
E.  The Village may enter into proportionate share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility.

K.  Alternative systems. When approved by the PBCPHU, alternative systems may be utilized where septic tank systems are not suitable or where a greater degree of treatment is desirable. All rules pertaining to drainfield systems and their design shall apply to alternative systems. Use of an alternative system may require the establishment of procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance and environmental monitoring to assure that the system continues to function properly. Use of a system to serve more than one (1) residence or commercial building under separate ownership and when located on separate lots shall require the establishment of a local sewer district, maintenance franchise or other legally binding arrangement for the operation and maintenance of such system. In addition, the PBCPHU shall require the submission of plans prepared by an engineer registered in the State of Florida and qualified in the field of waste water system design prior to considering the use of any alternative system. The PBCPHU shall also require the design engineer to certify that the installed system complies with the approved design and installation requirements. The following alternative systems may be considered for approval by the PBCPHU. 
1.  Compost toilets. Organic waste composting toilets may be approved for use, provided that graywater and any other liquid and solid waste is properly collected and disposed of in accordance with standards established in this Section; odor control is provided; and the system has NSF approval. 
2.  Aerobic treatment. Aerobic treatment units may be utilized for residential and commercial domestic sewage treatment, provided that the unit to be installed is in compliance with National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) standards for Class I or Class 11 systems as defined by NSF Standards Number 40, revised May 1983, and provided the unit is approved by the PBCPHU. The following additional requirements shall also apply: 
a.  An appropriate failure warning device shall be installed in a conspicuous location.

Eligible management entities include cities, counties, water and sewer districts, sanitary districts, and public or private utilities. A private commercial management entity may be utilized provided each homeowner, or group of homeowners, submits a written contract to the PBCPHU which guarantees that the aerobic treatment unit will be maintained for the life of the system. Also, where State or local laws require a homeowners association for a particular type of development, such non-profit corporation may be considered to be an acceptable management entity. 
f.  Other alternative systems meeting the general requirements of this Section may be approved by the PBCPHU on a case-by-case basis, where evidence exists that use of such systems will not create sanitary nuisance conditions, health hazards or pollute receiving waters. 
Sec. 16.1.8. - Percolation tests. 
A.  When a percolation test is required to be performed, one (1) or more test holes shall be dug within the area proposed for a drainfield system. Where soil conditions within the area are highly variable, a minimum of three (3) percolation test holes, uniformly spaced, shall be required. 
B.  The diameter of each test hole shall be six (6) inches, dug or bored to the proposed depth of the absorption system. To expose a natural soil surface, the sides of the hole shall be scratched with a sharp pointed instrument and the loose material shall be removed from the bottom of the test hole. To protect the bottom from scouring action when water is added, two (2) inches of one-half (1/2) to three quarter (3/4) inch gravel shall be placed in the hole. 
C.  The hole must be carefully filled with at least twelve (12) inches of clear water. This depth of water shall be maintained for at least four (4) hours and preferably overnight if clay soils are present. Automatic siphons or float valves may be employed to automatically maintain the water level during the soaking period. In sandy soils with little or no clay, soaking is not necessary. If, after filling the hole twice with twelve (12) inches of water, the water seeps completely away in less than ten (10) minutes, the test can proceed immediately. 
D.  Except for sandy soils, percolation rate measurements shall be made at least fifteen (15) hours, but no more than thirty (30) hours, after the soaking period began. Any soil that sloughed into the hole during soaking period shall be removed and the water level adjusted to six (6) inches above the gravel (or eight (8) inches above the bottom of the hole). At no time during the test shall the water level be allowed to rise more than six (6) inches above the gravel. Immediately after adjustment, the water level is measured from a fixed reference point to the nearest one-sixteenth ( 1/16 ) inch at thirty (30) minute intervals. The test shall be continued until two (2) successive water level drops do not vary by more than one-sixteenth ( 1/16 ) inch. At least three (3) measurements must be made. After each measurement, the water level shall be readjusted to the six (6) inch level. The last water drop shall be used to calculate the percolation rate. In sandy soils or soils in which the first six (6) inches of water added, after the soaking period, seeps away in less than thirty (30) minutes, water level measurements are made at ten-minute intervals for a one hour period. The percolation rate is calculated for each test hole by dividing the time interval used between measurements by the magnitude of the last water level drop. This calculation results in a percolation rate in terms of minutes/inch. To determine the percolation rate for an area where soil conditions are highly variable, the rates obtained from each test hole shall be averaged. However, if the individual rates vary by more than twenty (20) minutes per inch, the maximum rate shall be used. 
Sec. 16.1.9. - Collection, treatment and disposal of septage. 
A.  No person(s) or corporation shall engage in the business of servicing septic tanks, grease traps, portable toilets or other treatment receptacles without first obtaining an annual license from the PBCPHU. 
B.  Application for a septage disposal service license shall be made to the PBCPHU. The following must be provided for evaluation prior to issuance of a license:

E.  Septage shall be transported to the disposal site in a manner that will preclude leakage, spillage or the creation of a sanitary nuisance. 
F.  The septage from an on-site waste disposal system shall be disposed of in a manner approved by the PBCPHU. Untreated septage shall not be applied to the land. 
G.  No on-site storage facility shall be utilized without prior approval by the PBCPHU. 
H.  All service records shall be maintained at the business location and made available to any representative of the PBCPHU upon request. 
I.  The following equipment, maintenance and service requirements shall be complied with: 
1.  All waste transportation equipment shall be maintained in good working order at all times. Valves, hoses, tanks and appurtenances shall be properly maintained and shall not leak. Valves shall be locked to prevent accidental opening during transportation and storage. 
2.  Tank trucks used for servicing portable toilets shall be provided with a dual compartment tank and shall be approved by the PBCPHU. One (1) tank shall be used for receiving and removing wastes and shall be equipped with a suction hose having a cut-off valve not more than thirty-six (36) inches from the intake end. The second tank shall be used for clean water storage and shall be of adequate size to allow proper cleaning of each serviced unit. Water from the second tank shall be provided under pressure. 
3.  Standby service equipment shall be available for use during breakdown or emergencies. If equipment from another approved service is to be used for standby purposes, a written agreement between the services must be provided to the PBCPHU. 
4.  The waste storage compartment of a tank truck shall be maintained as necessary to prevent the creation of sanitary nuisance conditions. 
5.  There shall appear in a conspicuous place on each portable or temporary toilet the name, address and telephone number of the servicing company.

    Any person owning or controlling property upon which an on-site sewage disposal system is installed shall be responsible for maintenance of the system. The following criteria are provided for guidance in proper system maintenance. 
A.  Systems shall be maintained at all times to prevent seepage of sewage or effluent to the surface of the ground. 
B.  Septic tanks and other sewage retention tanks should be checked at least once every three (3) years, or once a year if garbage grinders are discharging to the tank, to determine if sludge must be removed. Tanks should be cleaned whenever the bottom of the scum layer is within eight (8) inches of the bottom of the outlet device or when the sludge level is within eighteen (18) inches of the bottom of the outlet device. 
C.  Grease traps should be cleaned at appropriate intervals to insure that at least fifty (50) percent of the grease retention capacity of the trap is retained. 
D.  Organic chemical solvents shall not be used for the purpose of degreasing or declogging on-site sewage disposal systems.

Advance notice shall be given to future purchasers of the semi-public -and/or non-community water systems that the system shall be connected to a public or investor-owned community water supply when such a supply becomes available, and that the purchaser has certain operational requirements until such connection is completed. 
J.  Conditions and safeguards. Provided that the factual findings specified in Secs. 16.2.13.H or 16.2.13.I above are made, the Environmental Appeal Board may reverse, modify or affirm, wholly or partly, the requirement, interpretation or determination made by the PBCPHU or the Environmental Control Officer. In granting an appeal, the Environmental Appeal Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards consistent with this section. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the appeal is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this section. The Environmental Appeal Board may also prescribe a reasonable time within which the action for which the appeal is granted shall be started or completed or both. Any decision of the Environmental Appeal Board shall be in the form of a written order. 
K.  Change in facts. If there is a change in the facts or circumstances supporting a request for relief after an order granting relief has been issued, then the applicant shall notify the PBCPHU. The PBCPHU may request the Environmental Appeal Board to revoke or amend the order. 
L.  Termination of relief. Except where the relief granted is to exempt an applicant from the requirement to connect to a public or investor-owned community water supply under Sec. 16.2.10, any relief granted shall automatically terminate upon the availability of a community water supply to the lot or parcel. Upon the request of the PBCPHU or the Environmental Control Officer, the Environmental Appeal Board may modify or rescind an order granting relief from the requirements to connect to a public or investor-owned community water supply under Sec. 16.2.3.B if the conditions under which the appeal was granted no longer exist. Unless otherwise provided in an order issued pursuant to Sec. 16., relief granted under this section shall automatically lapse if action for which the appeal was granted has not been initiated within one (1) year from the date of granting such appeal by the Environmental Appeal Board or, if judicial proceedings to review the Environmental Appeal Board's decision shall be instituted, from the date of entry of the final order in such proceedings, including all appeals. 
M.  Decision. The decision of the Environmental Appeal Board shall be final administrative action. Any person who is a party to the proceeding may appeal to the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
Sec. 16.2.14. - Violations, penalties, enforcement and inspections. 
A.  Violations and penalties. It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this section or any duly constituted order of the Palm Beach County Environmental Control Hearing Board enforcing this section. Such violations shall be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Chapter 77-616, Special Acts, Laws of Florida, as amended, and Palm Beach County Environmental Control Ordinance No. 78-5, as amended. 
B.  Inspections. It shall be the duty of the County Health Director or his authorized representative to conduct such inspections as are reasonable and necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. 
CHAPTER 3. - PROHIBITION OF DUMPING, REGULATION OF WASTE DISPOSAL AND CLEAN FILL ACTIVITY 

Sec. 16.3.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this section is to protect the surficial aquifer and prevent sanitary nuisances and public health threats by prohibition of dumping, regulation of waste disposal and clean fill activity. The specific objectives of this section are to establish prohibition for dumping or placing of waste upon any land or water on private or public property and regulate the disposition of clean fill. 
Sec. 16.3.2. - Applicability. 
    The standards of this section shall apply to all activities involving disposal of waste and clean fill activities within the unincorporated or incorporated areas of Palm Beach County. 
Sec. 16.3.3. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from the standards of this section: 
A.  Existing Approvals. All waste management activities which are approved by Department of Environmental Regulations, Solid Waste Authority, or the Palm Beach County Public Health Unit (PBCPHU). 
B.  Agricultural Waste. Agricultural waste disposal, provided the agricultural wastes are generated and disposed of on site and the property is agriculturally zoned. 
C.  Soil and Mulch. Soil and mulch brought on to a property and used for the purpose of improving soil/plant relations through improving retention of nutrients and water for plants in ground or above ground on that site. 
D.  Clean Fill. Clean fill disposed on land located in the Village or Palm Beach County if the person obtains the property owner's consent and the property has provided the Palm Beach County Public Health Unit (PBCPHU) with required notification as set forth herein. 
Sec. 16.3.4. - Prohibition for Dumping and Placing Waste. 
    It is unlawful and shall constitute willful causing of pollution for any person to dump, or cause or allow to be dumped; or place, or cause or allow to be placed; or bury, or cause or allow to be buried; any waste upon any land, or any water located in Village. 
Sec. 16.3.5. - Regulation of Clean Fill Activities. 
A.  Prohibitions of Clean Fill Activities. It is unlawful for any person to engage in the following activities: 
1.  Create or maintain a sanitary nuisance due to clean fill activities; 
2.  Adversely affect drainage resulting from clean fill activities; or 
3.  Store waste which results from clean fill activities for more than seven (7) days. 
B.  Notification of Clean Fill Activities. 
1.  Initial notification. Forty-five (45) working days prior to the commencement of clean fill activities, the property owner shall provide the PBCPHU written initial notification. Initial notification shall include; property owner(s) name, mailing address, phone number, clean fill material to be utilized, amount of clean fill activity, a survey prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor, and a sketch indicating location of fill on property. 
2.  Exception. Initial notification shall not be required for the following activities: 
a.  Clean fill activities at parcels that have received a Palm Beach Village Engineering Department subdivision approval and have a Land Development Permit; 
b.  Clean fill activities necessitated by the Building Department permit standards for individual lot improvements which previously have not received a Land Development Permit. The intent is to allow the clean filling of individual unplatted or by-passed platted lots to meet current standards without deleteriously impacting the surrounding parcels; 
c.  Clean fill activities at sites that have received a dredge and fill permit; or 
d.  Clean fill activities conducted by any governmental agency. 
3.  Other permits required. Notification to the PBCPHU does not relieve the property owner from the need to obtain any local, state, or federal permit nor does it relieve the property owner from abiding by all local, state or federal laws, as applicable. 
Sec. 16.3.6. - Enforcement, Penalties, Circuit Court Proceedings. 
    Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section shall constitute a violation of this Code. 
A.  Enforcement. The PBCPHU shall have available to it all enforcement remedies made available pursuant to Chapter 77-616, Laws of Florida, as amended, and County ordinances adopted pursuant thereto. Violations will be heard by the Environmental Control Hearing Board. 
B.  Penalties. Penalties that may be imposed include the following: 
1.  A civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each violations; and 
2.  Affirmative action such as a requirement that the violator perform roadside waste clean-up services or bear the cost of waste removal in lieu of such services. 
C.  Circuit Court Proceedings. Circuit Court proceedings may be instituted to abate and prosecute violations, or enforce orders. Such relief may include both temporary and permanent injunctions.
