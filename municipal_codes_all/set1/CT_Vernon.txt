PREFACE 
This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the Town of Vernon, Connecticut of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 12 is numbered 12-1 and the fifth section of Chapter 16 is 16-5. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or divisions. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Henry F. Butler, Town Clerk, and Mitchel E. Kallet, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Town's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER AND SPECIAL ACTS  
SUBPART A. - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Printed herein is the Charter of the Town of Vernon adopted on November 6, 1990. A uniform system of punctuation and capitalization has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation and material in brackets [ ] has been added for clarity. 
 
CHAPTER I. - PREAMBLE 
The Town of Vernon was incorporated in 1808. In the course of time, rural Vernon acquired within its boundaries a flourishing manufacturing center. In recognition of its differing need and in a spirit of cooperation, the City of Rockville was incorporated within the Town of Vernon in 1889. Continuing to manifest the same spirit of cooperation in response to progress and attendant change, the Vernon Fire District was created in 1947. As the town grew further, the separate governmental bodies were consolidated into one in 1965 to form the present Town of Vernon. 
The ability to accommodate change in a reasoned manner and thus provide for the best interest of the town has long characterized the collective political efforts of Vernon's residents. Such ability shaped the content and form of the first Charter in 1965 as well as its revisions. It is the intent of this Charter that all boards, commissions, authorities and departments thus established shall enjoy full and unimpaired exercise of their duties and responsibilities. It is the further intent of this Charter that all town boards, commissions, authorities, and departments shall cooperate in all possible instances for the sound development and proper government of the Town of Vernon, and shall encourage voters to remain informed and participate in the sound development of their town.  
CHAPTER II. - CORPORATE POWERS 
 
Section 1. - General grant of powers. 
In addition to all powers now or hereafter granted to cities, towns and fire districts under the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and the Connecticut General Statues, Revision of 1958, as amended, the Town of Vernon shall have all powers specifically granted by this Charter and all powers fairly implied in or incident to the management of the property, government and affairs of the town, including the power to enter into contracts with the United States or any federal agency, the State of Connecticut or any political subdivision thereof for services and the use of facilities, the exercise of which is not expressly forbidden by the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended. The enumeration of particular powers in this and any other chapter of this Charter shall not be construed as limiting this general grant of power but shall be considered as an addition thereto.  
Section 2. - Specific grants of power. 
The Town of Vernon shall have, in addition to all powers granted to cities, fire districts and towns under the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, all the specific powers set forth in section 7-194 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, from time to time, such powers to be exercised by the town through the enactment and enforcement of ordinances, bylaws or otherwise.  
CHAPTER III. - ELECTION OF OFFICERS 
 
Section 1. - Applicability of general statutes. 
Except as specifically provided herein, the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, relating to the making and registration of voters, the holding of sessions, for the purpose of making an enrollment of the electors who are entitled to vote in any primary, caucus or election, the conduct of elections, the counting of votes and the declaration of the result shall be applicable to all primary, regular or special elections held in accordance with the provisions of this Charter. The town council shall provide by ordinance for the manner of warning town elections and such additional regulations in respect to elections, not inconsistent with the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, or this Charter, as may be necessary to accomplish the intent of this Charter.  
Section 2. - State and federal officers. 
Nomination and election of state and federal officers, state senators and representatives, judge of probate, two (2) registrars of voters and not more than thirty (30) justices of the peace to be determined by the town council by ordinance shall be conducted and the registrars of voters shall prepare lists of electors qualified to vote therefor, in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and the general and special laws of the State of Connecticut applicable to the Town of Vernon. 
(Ord. No. 209, § 1, 6-18-96)  
Section 3. - Basis of elections of the town officers. 
The election of all elected town officers shall be on an at-large basis. The town council by ordinance shall establish the number of polling places and/or voting districts within the Town of Vernon as may be deemed necessary from time to time.  
Section 4. - Nomination of candidates for town offices. 
Candidates for all elective position in the town shall be nominated (a) by political party endorsement or (b) by independent petition. 
The name of any elector of the town shall be placed on the voting machines at a town election as a candidate for any office to be filled, in whose behalf there shall have been filed with the town clerk (a) a certificate of candidacy as a party-endorsed candidate made in accordance with the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, or (b) a petition filed in accordance with the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended.  
Section 5. - Determination of sufficiency of petitions. 
The town clerk shall, upon filing of any such petition, proceed forthwith to determine its sufficiency by comparing the name of the candidate and the signatures thereon with the latest official list of the registrars of voters and with petitions already filed for the same office. If the town clerk finds the petition insufficient, the town clerk shall notify the candidate in writing forthwith and no further proceedings shall be had thereon except in accordance with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction to which an appeal may be taken from the decision of the town clerk, provided nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing, in the case of petitions found to be insufficient, the obtaining of additional valid signatures and the refiling of the petitions for nomination within the time limits prescribed for the presentation of the original petition. Any such petition shall be recorded as of the time it is refiled.  
Section 6. - Election of nominees. 
No person shall be eligible for election to any town office who is not at the time of election a resident elector of the Town of Vernon, and any person ceasing to be a resident elector of said town shall thereupon cease to hold elective office in the town.  
Section 7. - Breaking a tie. 
When any regular or special municipal election conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Charter results in a tie, with the consent of the tied candidates, the tie may be broken by a single toss of a coin by a third party agreeable to the tied candidates. Otherwise, an adjourned election shall be held in accordance with the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended.

All boards and commissions, including those advisory commissions created by the town council, and all appointments to fill vacancies on such boards and commissions shall conform to section 9-167a of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended concerning minority representation.  
CHAPTER IV. - RECALL, INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM 
 
Section 1. - Recall of elective officers. 
Any elective officer of the town may be recalled and removed from public office by the electors of the town. Any elector may file with the town clerk a petition containing the name and title of the elective officer whose removal is sought and a statement of the grounds for removal. Said petition shall be signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the town equal in number to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of electors who voted in the last municipal election in which such officer was elected, provided no recall petition may be filed against any officer until such officer has held office for six (6) months, and only one (1) verified recall petition may be filed against any one (1) incumbent during the term for which elected. Said petition shall be accompanied by a statement of the circulator as provided in section 7-9 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended. If the town clerk shall determine the petition and the affidavits to be sufficient in manner prescribed by law, a recall vote shall be taken within thirty (30) but not sooner than ten (10) days after the filing of the petition, the form of the question being as nearly as possible[:] "Shall (here insert the name and title of the elective officers whose recall is sought) be recalled?" If any elective officer whose recall is sought resigns before such recall vote is taken, a referendum shall not be held. The elected officer whose removal is sought shall not be removed from office unless fifty percent (50%) of the eligible voters entitled to vote on the question of recall have in fact voted and of those voting, two-thirds have in fact voted in favor of the recall.  
Section 2. - Initiative. 
The electors shall have the power to propose to the town council any lawful ordinance or other measure, limited to the powers and duties of the town council, as provided in this Charter, except an ordinance or other measure appointing or removing officials, specifying the compensation of [or] hours of work of officials and employees, appropriating money, authorizing the levy of taxes or fixing the tax rate. Any elector may file with the town clerk a petition containing a summary and a full writing of such ordinance or measure. Said petition shall be signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the town equal in number to at least one percent (1%) of the registered voters at the last municipal election. Said petition shall be accompanied by a statement of the circulator as provided in section 7-9 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended. If the town clerk shall determine the petition and affidavits to be sufficient in the manner prescribed by law, said ordinance or measure shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular meeting of the town council and the town council shall permit at least one (1) of the electors whose signature appears on the petition to be heard on the proposed ordinance or measure. If the town council fails to adopt the proposed ordinance or measure within forty-five (45) days after the petition, as provided for herein, is filed, and if such petition shall be signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the town equal in number to at least ten percent (10%) of the registered voters at the last municipal election, the electors may adopt or reject the same at an election held within ninety (90) days after such petition was originally filed. Unless at least twenty percent (20%) of the electors entitled to vote on the question shall have voted, such proposed ordinance or other measure shall not become effective and the result shall be construed as against adoption. No ordinance or other measure which shall have been adopted in accordance with the election provisions of this section shall be repealed or amended by the town council within two (2) years of its adoption, but such ordinance or other measure may be repealed or amended by petition and vote of the electors in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of this chapter.  
Section 3. - Power of referendum. 
The electors shall have the power to approve or reject at a referendum as herein provided any ordinance or other measure passed by the town council, except an ordinance or other measure appointing or removing officials, specifying the compensation or hours of work of officials and employees, appropriating money, authorizing the levy of taxes or fixing the tax rate. Ordinance or other measures submitted to the town council by initiative petition as provided in section 2 and passed by the town council without change shall be subject to a referendum in the same manner as other ordinances or measures. Within twenty (20) days after the publication of any ordinance or other measure which is subject to a referendum, a petition signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the town equal in number to at least ten percent (10%) of the registered voters at the last municipal election may be filed with the town clerk requesting that any such ordinance or other measure be either repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. Said petition shall be accompanied by a statement of the circulator as provided in section 7-9 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended. The town clerk shall determine the sufficiency of the petition and the affidavits in the manner prescribed by law. Sixty (60) days after the filing of the petition, if the town council fails to repeal such ordinance or other measure, the question of repeal shall be submitted to the electors of the town. Upon the filing of a sufficient petition, the ordinance or measure shall remain without effect until the electors vote on the question as above mentioned. A majority vote of the electors to repeal the ordinance or measure shall not become effective unless a total of at least twenty percent (20%) of the electors entitled to vote on the question shall have voted and at least fifteen percent (15%) of the electors entitled to vote shall have voted for the repeal. If the vote to repeal fails, the ordinance or measure as passed by the town council shall become effective.  
CHAPTER V. - THE TOWN COUNCIL 
 
Section 1. - Membership of the town council. 
There shall be a town council consisting of twelve (12) members, hereinafter referred to as the town council, the members of which shall serve without compensation except for the reimbursement of actual expenses incurred in the performance of official duties.

The record so kept shall be authenticated for each meeting by the signatures of the presiding officer thereof, or the clerk, or of both.  
Section 5. - General powers and duties. 
The legislative power of the town shall be vested exclusively in the town council, except as otherwise provided in this Charter.

If the town council does not act to renew the ordinance, the ordinance is repealed. The town council may contract for services and use of facilities of the United States or any federal agency, the State of Connecticut and any political subdivision thereof, or may, by agreement, join with any such political subdivisions to provide services and facilities. The town council is authorized, in adopting ordinances, to incorporate any nationally recognized code, rules and regulations that have been printed in book form, or any code officially adopted by any administrative agency of the state, or any portion thereof, by reference thereto in such ordinance; provided, upon adoption of any such ordinance wherein such code, rules and regulations or portions thereof have been incorporated by reference, there shall be maintained three (3) copies of such code, rules and regulations in the office of the town clerk for examination by the public. Said town council, except as hereinafter provided, may fix the charges, if any, to be made for services by the town or for the execution of powers vested in the town as provided by Charter. Any statutory functions and/or powers of the selectmen not specifically delegated to other bodies shall be delegated to the town council.  
Section 6. - Public hearing on and publication of ordinances. 
At least one (1) public hearing shall be held by the town council before any ordinance shall be passed. Public notice of said hearing shall be given at least five (5) days in advance by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Vernon and by posting a notice in a public place. Such hearing and notice shall not be necessary for any ordinance relating to the town council, its procedures, or its appointment or designation of officers. Every ordinance, after passage, shall be given a serial number and be recorded by the town clerk in a book to be kept for that purpose which shall be properly indexed. Within ten (10) days after passage, notice of the passage of an ordinance, described by title or subject matter together with such change in the proposed ordinance, shall be published in a newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Vernon. Every ordinance, unless it shall specify a later date, shall become effective on the 15th day after such publication following its final passage, except as otherwise provided in this Charter, provided an ordinance stated to be a public emergency measure and stating the facts constituting such public emergency shall become effective immediately after such posting and no public hearing or notice of public hearing shall be required for any public emergency measure.  
Section 7. - Investigations. 
The town council shall have the power to investigate any and all departments, offices, agencies, boards, commissions and authorities of the town and for such purposes shall have the power to issue subpoenas.

Any person aggrieved by a decision of the town council acting under the provisions of section 7 above shall have the right of appeal from such decision as provided by law.

The annual town meeting for the consideration of the budget shall be held on the fourth Tuesday of April at such hour and at such place as the town council may determine. 
The annual town meeting shall be called to order by the mayor or, in his absence, the town clerk. A moderator shall be elected and all business conducted in the manner now or hereafter provided by chapter 90 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, except as otherwise provided in this Charter.

Section 6. - Duties of the town council on the budget. 
The town council shall hold two (2) or more public hearings, the last of which shall be the annual town meeting, not later than April 30 at which any elector or taxpayer may have an opportunity to be heard regarding appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year. Following receipt of the estimates from the mayor, the water pollution control authority and the board of education, the town council shall cause sufficient copies of said estimates to be made available for general distribution in the office of the town clerk, and at least five (5) days prior to the aforementioned public hearings, the town council shall cause to be published in a newspaper having circulation in the town a notice of such public hearings and a summary of the said proposed budget and enterprise activity estimates showing anticipated revenues by major sources and proposed expenditures by functions or departments in the same columnar form as prescribed for budget estimates in section 5 of this chapter and shall also show the amount to be raised by taxation.

An approved allotment may be revised during the budget year in the same manner as the original allotment was made. If at any time during the budget year the town administrator shall ascertain that the available income, plus balances, for the year will be less than the total appropriations, the town administrator shall reconsider the work programs and allotments of the several offices, departments and agencies and recommend to the mayor revised allotments so as to forestall the making of expenditures in excess of the said income.  
Section 8. - Emergency appropriations. 
Emergency appropriations not exceeding five percent (5%) of the current budget for operations and capital improvements in any one (1) fiscal year may be made upon the recommendation of the mayor and by a vote of not fewer than three-fourths of the town council present and constituting a quorum for the purpose of meeting a public emergency threatening the lives, health or property of citizens. A public hearing, at which any elector or taxpayer of the town shall have an opportunity to be heard, shall be held prior to making such appropriation. Notice of such hearing shall be given in a newspaper having circulation in the town not more than ten (10) nor less than five (5) days prior to such hearing. Such hearing and notice of hearing may be waived if the town council, by at least three-fourths of its present constituting a quorum, shall decide that a delay in making the emergency appropriation would jeopardize the lives, health or property of citizens. In the absence of an available unappropriated and unencumbered general cash balance to meeting such appropriation, additional means of financing shall be provided in such manner, consistent with the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, and of this Charter, as may be determined by the town council.

(a)  No purchase shall be made by any department, board, commission or officer of the town, other than the board of education and the probate court, except through the finance department and such purchases shall be made under such rules and regulations as may be established by the town council or the water pollution control authority. The finance officer shall record the amount of authorized purchases and contracts for future purchases as encumbrances against the appropriation from which they are to be paid. 
(b)  No voucher claim or charge against the town including those of the board of education shall be paid until the same has been audited by the finance officer or his agent and approved by him for correctness and legality. Checks will be drawn and signed by the finance officer for the payment of approved claims which shall be valid only when countersigned by the town treasurer or town administrator. In the absence or inability to act of either the finance officer, town administrator or town treasurer with respect to the above duty, the mayor shall be authorized to substitute temporarily for either one of them, but not for any two (2) of them. 
(c)  The finance officer shall prescribe the time at which and the manner in which persons receiving money on account of the town shall pay the same to the town treasurer.

The finance officer shall supply monthly reports showing the status of appropriation allotments to each organization unit head. When any department, commission, board or officer shall desire to secure a transfer of funds in its appropriation from funds within an account classification, before incurring any expenditure therefor, such department, commission board or officer shall make application to the finance officer, whose duty it shall be to examine into the matter, and upon approval of the finance officer such transfer may be made, but not otherwise. When any department, commission, board or officer shall desire to secure a transfer of funds in its appropriation from funds set apart for one specific purpose to another, with the exception of transfers within account classifications as referenced above, before incurring any expenditure therefor, such department, commission board or officer shall make application to the finance officer, whose duty it shall be to examine into the matter, and upon approval of the town council such transfer may be made, but not otherwise. 
(e)  Upon the request of the mayor, but only within the last three (3) months of the fiscal year, the town council may transfer any unencumbered appropriation, balance or portion thereof from one (1) department, commission, board or office to another. No transfer shall be made from any appropriations for debt service and other statutory charges until such time that all obligations have been met or provided for by encumbrance. 
(f)  Additional appropriations over and above the total budget or a new appropriation may be made from time to time by resolution of the town council upon recommendation of the mayor except that any appropriation or new appropriation in excess of 1/10 of 1% of the total budget shall not be approved unless a public hearing is held and the sum approved by a special town meeting held under the provisions as provided elsewhere in this Charter. 
(g)  Appropriations for construction or for other permanent improvements, from whatever source derived, shall not lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was made shall have been accomplished or abandoned, provided any such project shall be deemed to have been abandoned if three (3) fiscal years shall elapse without any expenditure from or encumbrance of the appropriation therefor. Any portion of an annual appropriation remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the close of the budget year shall lapse. 
(h)  Every payment made in violation of the provisions of this Charter shall be deemed illegal and every official authorizing or making such payment or taking part therein and every person receiving such payment or taking part therein shall be jointly and severally liable to the town for the full amount so paid or received. If any officer or employee of the town shall knowingly incur any obligation or shall authorize or make any expenditure in violation of the provisions of this Charter or take any part therein, such action shall be cause for removal. 
(i)  With respect to enterprise activities under its jurisdiction, the water pollution control authority shall have and exercise all of the powers and duties conferred on the mayor and town council by this section.

Section 2. - Extension of services. 
(a)  Upon the extension of a sewer line past any property for which there exists at the time of such extension an adequate private sewerage system, the owner of said property may or may not, at his option, connect that property to the sewer line. If he chooses not to avail himself of the sewer extension, he shall not be required to do so as long as his private sewerage system is not a menace to the health and safety of the community. Any building which is erected and any subdivision which is developed in the town which can equitably be serviced by an existing sewer line or an extension thereof shall be required to be connected to same. The property owner shall be liable for any assessment or charge levied by the town council or the water pollution control authority in appropriate cases whether or not be chooses to connect his property to the sewer line. 
(b)  Residents of the town shall have the right to petition for the extension of any town service. The town council by ordinance may authorize such extension.

Before authorizing the extension of services through the petition process, the town council after receiving petitions shall seek an opinion from the planning and zoning commission which shall have thirty (30) days in which to transmit its opinion, and the town council shall hold a public hearing in the manner specified by this Charter for all ordinances. The town council shall determine whether or when services petitioned for shall be extended. 
The town administrator shall prepare a suitable petition form, which shall be available in the town clerk's office. Completed petition forms shall define the area of town for which the extension of services is sought and the nature of the requested services. Forms shall include or be accompanied by the signature of a majority of property owners in the defined area and the authenticity of the signatures shall be sworn to by the person or persons filing the petition with the town clerk. 
The town clerk shall determine whether a majority of property owners in the defined area have signed the petition and shall communicate such finding, the petition form and signatures to the town council. 
(c)  Extensions of service shall be financed through an appropriate user service charge, connection fee or special assessment as provided by chapter 103 of the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, or in such manner as may be provided by the town council.  
Section 3. - Tax bills. 
It shall be the duty of the collector of revenue to mail to each taxpayer, before the date when taxes are due and payable, a tax bill, the form of which shall be acceptable to the state commissioner of revenue services.  
Section 4. - Assessment and collection of taxes. 
Except as specifically provided in this chapter, the assessment of property for taxation and the collection of taxes shall be carried on as provided in the Connecticut General Statutes, Revision of 1958, as amended, or special laws of the State of Connecticut applicable to the Town of Vernon.  
CHAPTER XIV. - THE MERIT SYSTEM

In no event shall the town council reduce the salary of a class below the minimum or raise it above the maximum salary established by the pay plan except by amendment to the pay plan.  
Section 6. - Retirement of town employees. 
The town council may provide by ordinance a system of retirement allowances for the town's regular full-time paid employees and for contributions by employees and the town of a fund from which such allowances shall be paid.

In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all town officials, employees, individual(s), partnership(s), corporation(s) or other entities as defined hereinafter is adopted. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials, employees, individuals, partnerships, corporations or other entities by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the town and by directing disclosure by such officials, employees, individuals, partnerships, corporations or other entities of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the town.

He does not have an interest which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest and of his responsibilities as prescribed by the laws of the state and the town if any benefit or detriment accrues to him as a member of a business, profession, occupation or group to no greater extent than any other member of such business, profession, occupation or group. For the purpose of this article a public officer or employee shall be deemed to have an interest in the affairs of his or her spouse.

This does not prohibit any town official, employee, individual(s), partnership(s), corporation(s) or other entities from appearing before any board or commission on such person's own behalf or as official spokesman for an organization of which he is a member, provided such appearance does not violate sections 8-11 and 8-21 and 22a-42 of the general statutes and Public Act 83-540 or any other provision of this article. 
(h)  No town official, employee, individual(s), partnership(s), corporation(s) or other entities who in their capacity as such officer or employee participates in the making of a contract or accepts a purchase order in which they have a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, shall bid upon nor enter into any contact or bid upon nor accept any purchase order from the town or board of education unless the town administrator for the town or superintendent of schools for the board of education waived the requirements of this section after determining that it is in the best interest of the town to do so.

Sec. 3-2. - Numbering buildings. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section shall be to promote public safety and convenience by providing a rational street numbering system whereby addresses may be identified with the ease and speed which is essential to the quick response of emergency services, including police, firefighting and emergency medical care. 
(b)  Assignment of numbers. Under the supervision of the town engineer and town assessor, the town, without notice, may assign to each building, or part of a building other than an accessory building, a street identification number by which such building shall be known and may change such number of such building or part of such building. Whenever a new street or highway is laid out, the town shall assign to the land abutting such street or highway numbers at such measured intervals or distances as the public interest shall require. The town engineer shall assign such identification numbers to any subdivisions approved after July 20, 1986. The town assessor shall assign such identification numbers to all other buildings or lots. 
(c)  Buildings existing on July 20, 1986. The owners of buildings existing on July 20, 1986, shall affix numerals indicating the street identification number which has been assigned to such building. Any owner who refuses or neglects to comply with this section shall be notified by the town, in writing, of the provisions of this section and shall comply with such provisions within thirty (30) days of the mailing of such notice. Address identification using words rather than numerals shall not satisfy this requirement. 
(d)  Buildings completed after July 20, 1986. The owners of buildings completed after July 20, 1986, shall affix numerals indicating the street identification numbers assigned to such building prior to the occupancy of such buildings. 
(e)  Location and other specifications of numerals. The numerals used to indicate the street identification number of buildings shall be located on the exterior front of the building which they identify or on a post, sign, mailbox or other device located between the building and the street. Such numerals shall be at least three (3) inches in height and shall be of a color contrasting to the color of the background material to which they are affixed. When affixed, they shall be positioned not less than four (4) feet nor more than twelve (12) feet from the surface of the ground directly below them, except when they are affixed to a mailbox, in which case the minimum height for such numerals shall be forty-two (42) inches from street level. The location and size of such numerals shall be sufficient to ensure their legibility when the building which they occupy is viewed from one (1) or more points along the centerline of the street on which it fronts between projections of the sides of such building intersecting perpendicularly with the centerline. If such building is set back more than one hundred (100) feet from the centerline of the street on which it fronts, or if the numerals cannot be made legible from the centerline because of construction, the numerals shall be affixed to a post, sign, mailbox or other device which shall be located within ten (10) feet of the driveway entrance to the premises and which shall otherwise conform to the specifications herein.

(Ord. No. 163, 7-1-86)  
Sec. 3-3. - Demolition delay. 
(a)  Findings. There are located in Vernon buildings of architectural and historic importance that are invaluable assets of the community and are irreplaceable. Historic buildings may be subject to demolition due to their age and condition. An owner of an historically significant building may not realize the significance of the building, the feasibility of rehabilitation, the potential for adaptive reuse or its marketability for sale to a party interested in obtaining an historic building. A temporary delay of demolition of an historic building accompanied by public notification of the pending demolition can prevent an irremediable error from occurring and be an important step in preserving the historically significant architecture of the community. 
(b)  Application to be filed; required information. Each person filing an application for a permit to demolish a building in the Town of Vernon that is more than fifty (50) years old shall file with the town's building official, on forms provided by the building official, the following: (1) Any information required by the building official; (2) The address of the building to be demolished; (3) The name and address of the building's owner; (4) The date on which demolition is desired to begin; and (5) The approximate age and type of building to be demolished. The application shall include a copy of the current assessor's street card. 
(c)  Notice. Upon receipt of an application, the building official shall publish a copy of the notice in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the town. Such notice shall be published not later than fifteen (15) days after its receipt by the building official. The building official shall mail such notice, not later than the date of its publication, to the local historic properties commission, the municipal historian, and to any person or organization requesting such notification by a written document delivered to the building official. Each such request for notification shall be renewed annually in writing. 
(d)  Purpose of notice; delay authorized. The purpose of the notice of demolition is to provide public awareness of the intent to demolish a building more than fifty (50) years old so that proper consideration may be given to its historical, architectural and/or cultural significance to the town. If the building official has received no written objection to the application within fifteen (15) days after such notice is published, he/she may issue a demolition permit. If the building official receives a written objection to the issuance of a permit, he/she shall delay the issuance of a permit for up to ninety (90) days following the date on which he/she received the application and notice. 
(e)  Waiver by building official. If the building official, in consultation with the historic properties commission and/or the municipal historian, makes a written finding that the building which is proposed to be demolished is not of an age, style, location and/or cultural significance to the town, he/she may waive the provision of this section requiring notice of the provision requiring delay in the issuance of a demolition permit. 
(f)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the action of the building official in waiving such provisions or delaying the demolition may appeal to the building code board of appeals. Upon receipt of a written request for appeal, the building official shall request the chair of the building code board of appeals to conduct a public hearing within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after the date of receipt of the appeal. The board shall upon majority vote affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the building official in a written decision. The board shall file its decision with the building official not later than five (5) days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, following the day of the hearing. A copy of the decision shall be mailed to the party making the appeal.

Sec. 8-4. - Curfew for minors. 
(a)  Purpose. The town council has found that the incidence of crimes committed by and against minors is increasing and has determined that a curfew ordinance is necessary and desirable.

(2)  Promote parental responsibility for and supervision of minors; and, 
(3)  Protect the general public from nocturnal mischief and crime committed by minors. 
Therefore, a curfew for those under the age of eighteen (18) will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the Town of Vernon.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGNATION OF SCENIC ROADS 
 
Sec. 11-76. - Purpose and authority. 
The scenic and rural roads of Vernon are a cherished and irreplaceable resource critical for the protection of Vernon's natural heritage. The scenic values of many of Vernon's roads have been destroyed or are in danger of being destroyed because of past or potential alterations to their right-of way. These changes have had an adverse impact on the quality of Vernon's aesthetic and historic environment, an environment that is beneficial to both residents and visitors alike. 
It is the purpose of this article to balance the need to preserve and protect the scenic and historic values of rural roads with the need to maintain them in good and sufficient repair and passable condition. 
Pursuant to Connecticut General Statute Section 7-149a, the town may, by ordinance, designate town roads or portions of town roads as "scenic roads." The power to designate such scenic roads is delegated hereby this said article to the planning and zoning commission (PZC). No state highway or portion thereof may be designated as a scenic road under this article. 
(Ord. No. 256, § 1, 12-21-04)  
Sec. 11-77. - Criteria for scenic road designation. 
The Vernon Planning and Zoning Commission (hereafter referred to as "commission") shall consider designating as a scenic road only those town roads, which are free of intensive commercial development and intensive vehicular traffic and meet at least one of the following criteria: 
(1)  It is unpaved; 
(2)  It is bordered by mature trees or stone walls; 
(3)  The traveled portion is no more than twenty (20) feet wide; 
(4)  It offers scenic views, which for purposes of this article shall mean it affords vistas of marshes, shoreline, forests with mature trees, ridgelines or notable geologic or other natural features; 
(5)  It passes through agricultural land or abuts land on which is located an historic building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Places, compiled pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (CGS); 
(6)  It blends naturally into the surrounding terrain, or 
(7)  It parallels or crosses over brooks, streams, lakes or ponds. 
(Ord. No. 256, § 2, 12-21-04)  
Sec. 11-78. - Procedure for scenic road designation. 
(a)  Any party seeking to have a road or a portion of a road designated as a "scenic road" may file an application for such designation with the commission. When a road is to be considered for designation as a scenic road, the commission shall schedule a public hearing on the application. 
Hearing notices and deadlines shall be made in compliance with the provisions of Sections 8-26d and 8-26e of the Connecticut General Statutes. The commission shall notify the Vernon Town Council, the Vernon Public Works Director, the conservation commission and all owners of lot frontage abutting the road or portion of the road under consideration for a scenic road. 
(b)  Following the public hearing, the commission shall vote on the proposed design-nation. No road or portion of a road may be designated as a scenic road under this article unless owners of a majority of lot frontage abutting the road or portion of the road agree to the designation by filing a written statement of approval with the Vernon Town Clerk. The commission shall send notice of said designation to the owners of lots with frontage abutting the road. Said notice shall provide that the owners shall have sixty (60) days to either agree or disagree with the designation. Those owners who fail to file a written statement with the town clerk shall be considered to be in agreement with the designation, provided that any abutter who fails to respond shall not be deemed to have waived their right to appeal said designation under subsection (d) of this article. 
(c)  The scenic road designation may be rescinded by the commission, using the same procedures, and having the written concurrence of the majority of owners with lot frontage abutting the scenic road. 
(d)  Any person who is aggrieved by a designation of a road or portion of a road as a scenic road may appeal such designation in the manner and utilizing the same standards of review provided for appeals from the decisions of planning commissions under Section 8-8 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 256, § 3, 12-21-04)  
Sec. 11-79. - Procedures for scenic road alteration and improvement. 
(a)  Subject to the notice and hearing requirements set forth in this article, any road or portion of any road designated as a scenic road shall be maintained by the Town of Vernon in good and sufficient repair and in passable condition. 
(b)  Any party, including the Town of Vernon, proposing to carry out an activity within a scenic road right-of-way (ROW) must apply to the commission, which shall schedule a public hearing on the proposal. Hearing notices and deadlines shall be made in compliance with the provisions of Sections 8-26d and 8-26e of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
(c)  No road which has been designated as a scenic road under this article shall be altered or improved, except for good cause as determined by the commission. "Alterations or improvements" include, but are not limited to, widening of the right-of-way (ROW) or the traveled portion of the road, paving, changes of grade, straightening, removal of stone walls and mature trees. "Good cause" means maintaining the scenic road in good and sufficient repair and in passable condition. In the case of a natural disaster where the scenic road becomes impassable or posts a danger to public safety, it can be repaired to pre-emergency conditions. Examples of "good cause" include, but are not limited to, correcting drainage problems; removing dead and decaying trees and branches of trees; straightening of curves that pose a danger for vehicles traveling on them; repairing existing bridges, guardrails, guideposts and other engineering structures with similar materials that compliment the scenic character of the road; trimming tree branches and brush that overhang or encroach on the traveled portion of the road; and removing obstacles that prevent vehicles from traveling on the road. The commission shall state the reasons for its approval of such alterations and improvements in its minutes. 
Emergency, routine, and minor maintenance on any road that has been designated as a scenic road under this article shall be continued by the Town of Vernon without the necessity of town council vote, review by the planning and zoning commission (PZC) or public hearing. Such work includes the removal of dead, diseased, damaged, or dangerous trees and branches of trees; trimming of tree branches that encroach on the traveled portion of the road below the height needed to allow school busses, emergency vehicles, and town road maintenance vehicles to pass; trimming or removal of brush and removal of boulders or other obstacles that encroach on the traveled portion of the road; necessary trimming for utility lines; trimming of brush to enhance and to protect scenic views, stone walls, and mature trees; correction of drainage problems; striping, gravelling, filling, retreatment including, but not limited to, overlay paving and chip sealing and repair of existing roadway surfaces; grading; snowplowing; sanding and emergency repairs to the scenic road in the case of a natural disaster that makes it impassable or unsafe for public traffic. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prohibit a person owning or occupying land abutting a scenic road from maintaining and repairing the land which abuts the scenic road if the maintenance or repair occurs on land not within the right-of-way, or provide minor maintenance in the right-of-way, paved or unpaved, of the scenic road.

For the purposes of these regulations, the Special Flood Hazard areas are zones A, A1-30, AE, and AH as delineated on the Flood Insurance rate map as part of the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (F.E.M.A.) dated August 9, 1999. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations, within areas of special flood hazards, no buildings or structures shall be built and no land shall be used, excavated or filled without approval by the Building Inspector in accordance with the provisions of this section and all other requirements of these regulations which are in concert with this section. 
5.2 - Prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy, building, and/or zoning permits for development in a special flood hazard area, 
all necessary permits required under federal or state law by other governmental agencies, must be obtained. 
5.2.1  New Construction and Substantial Improvements: New construction and substantial improvements shall be (1) anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement on the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; (2) constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; (3) constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; (4) constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
5.2.2  Utilities and drainage systems must be located and designed to be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. Water should be prevented from entering or accumulating within the components. 
5.2.3  New water and sewer systems, including on-site systems, must be located and designed to avoid impairment and minimize infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
5.2.4  Any manufactured (mobile) home (including a recreational vehicle placed on a site for one-hundred-eighty (180) consecutive days or longer) shall be installed using methods and practices, which minimize flood damage. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than ten (10) feet apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six feet (6') above ground level. 
5.2.5  The Building Inspector shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
5.2.6  As-built elevations and levels to which any flood proofing is effective must be submitted to the Building Inspector who shall maintain these records. 
5.3 - The following minimum requirements apply in specific zones designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (F.I.R.M.): 
5.3.1  In unnumbered A zones, the developer and the Building Official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize, base flood elevation and floodway data from alternative sources, prior to its being provided by FIA (Federal Insurance Administration) through its Flood Insurance Rate Study, as criteria for requiring that the standards of Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3, and 5.5 be met. 
5.3.2  In Zones A1-30, AE, or AH, new construction and substantial improvements, must meet the following standards: 
5.3.2.1  Residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level. 
5.4.2.2  Nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level; or to be flood proofed to or above that level provided the standards of Section 5.3.3 are met. 
5.3.3  Flood Proofing: Non-residential structure located in all A-zones may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural designs, specifications, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction which are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. 
5.3.4  All manufactured homes (including "mobile" homes placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer) to be placed or substantially improve shall be: 
5.3.4.1  Elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation; and 
5.3.4.2  Placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
5.4 - In riverine situations, 
the developer must notify adjacent communities and the State Coordinating office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit copies of such notifications to the PZC and FEMA. No permit shall be issued for any proposed alteration or relocation of a watercourse unless the flood carrying capacity is maintained. 
5.5 - The following floodway provisions shall apply: 
5.5.1  In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. 
5.5.2  Should data be requested and/or provided, the Town shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourses. 
5.5.3  The regulatory floodways established by FEMA on the flood boundary and floodway map are adopted and incorporation herein by reference. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential, any development or encroachment (including fill) which would result in any increase (0.00) in flood levels during base flood discharge is prohibited. To demonstrate a less than 0.00 increase the applicant must provide hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices.

5.8.5  New construction: For insurance purposes, new construction will pertain to structures for which the start of construction or substantial improvement commenced on or after the effective date of the Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
5.8.5.1  For flood plain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction or substantial improvement commenced after the effective date of these regulations. 
5.8.6  Start of construction: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
5.8.7  "Structure" for flood plain management purposes, is a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. "Structure" for insurance coverage purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home or foundation. For the latter purpose, the term included a building in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises.

5.8.13  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or store, in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor. 
5.8.14  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes recreational vehicles, park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) days or longer and intended to be improved property.

5.8.16  Recreational Vehicles means a vehicle which is: 
a. built on a single chassis; 
b. four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
c. designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
d. designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
5.8.17  Substantial Improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure-taking place over a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be; 1) the appraised value of the structure "using the cost approach to value" prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, "Substantial Improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any improvement project required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specification, which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

per Section 4.24.4.4 and 4.25.4.4 Planned Development Zone: 
12.5 - Access Management: 
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall institute access management wherever possible as a means to manage driveways and intersections on state highways and other major streets in Vernon to reduce congestion and traffic conflicts. Provisions for immediate or future driveway connections to adjoining lots of similar existing or potential uses shall be made when such driveway connections will facilitate efficient emergency response and/or when such connections will enable the public to travel between adjoining lots without the need to travel upon a highway or street. The property owners' right to use and the obligation to maintain common driveways shall be assured by a written dedication and/or agreement between adjoining property owners to be recorded in the Vernon Land Records. Where street geometry, traffic volumes or traffic patterns warrant, the Commission may: 
12.5.1  Limit the number of driveways that provide access to a lot from the street. 
12.5.2  Designate the location of any street access.

12.5.5  No property shall be penalized for the elimination of existing or proposed parking spaces in order to accommodate shared access driveway connections if such elimination reduces the number of spaces below that required by section 12.1, and the property owner(s) shall not be required to pay a fee for each space eliminated as otherwise required by section 12.3.13. 
12.6 - Shared Parking: 
12.6.1  In order to minimize paved surfaces and eliminate the need to construct unnecessary parking spaces, the Commission may reduce the cumulative minimum parking requirements within a mixed-use development or for adjacent commercial or industrial properties if the applicant provides a parking study (based on empirical field data or similar data gathered by surveys by the American Planning Association, Institute of Transportation Engineers, or similar organizations) that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that one or more of the following conditions exist to warrant the reduction: 
12.6.1.1  Differences in the timing of peak parking demands among existing and/or proposed uses result in a net peak parking demand that is significantly lower than the cumulative minimum parking requirements; 
12.6.1.2  Synergistic relationships among uses create captive markets, resulting in multiple purpose walking trips within the development; and/or 
12.6.1.3  The development is likely to generate bus, bicycle, or pedestrian trips and accommodations exist or are proposed to support these alternative modes of transportation. 
12.6.2  If any use of the property changes at any time that negatively affects one or more of the conditions approved pursuant to section 12.6.1, this approval shall become invalid unless re-approved for the new use.

16.4 - Other provisions: 
The total area of all angle signs, parallel signs, and roof signs shall not exceed two (2) square feet for every linear foot of wall of that section of the structure occupied by said use. 
16.5 - Sign Policy: 
It is in the best interest of Vernon to establish a sign policy. This policy should provide a means of conveying a message without restricting the rights of the person communicating the message. Additionally, this policy should address the safety concerns of the citizenry and the overall aesthetic character of the Town. Signs present, often more than roads, buildings, or landscaping, a sense of negative ness via clutter, untidiness or overwhelming size, or a sense of visual pleasantness via consistency of scale. 
It is the intent of the Zoning Regulations to encourage the approval of signage which allow the necessary balance desired by all members of the community by focusing on the following aspects: 
 Relationship of signs to site; 
 Relationship of signs and site to adjoining areas; 
 Sign design; 
 Planning & Design Factors affecting safety to motorists, pedestrians, and property owners. 
16.5.1  Signs should facilitate efficient communication between businesses and the patrons they wish to attract. Signs should blend with the architectural style of the building to which they relate and should be visually pleasing and attractive. To create architecturally harmonious and visually attractive signs, the following criteria should be used: 
16.5.1.1  Signs should be designed as an architectural element of the building and should complement the architectural style of the building. 
16.5.1.2  Signs should be in good proportional scale to the building and site to which they relate. 
16.5.1.3  Whenever possible, sign letters should be attached directly to the building and signs should be located on the buildings sign freeze. 
16.5.1.4  Sign materials, lettering style, and form should be compatible with the building's design and use. 
16.5.1.5  Sign colors should be limited in number and be compatible with the building's façade. 
16.5.1.6  Signs should relate to the business at hand and not advertise brand names or symbols. 
16.5.1.7  The number of graphic elements on a sign should be held to a minimum and should not contain selling slogans or product descriptions. 
16.5.2  The boundary between residential and commercial/industrial zones represents a potential friction point in land use development. This is particularly true for intensive retail developments that bound along residential districts. Signs can represent the most visible element of development along this boundary and should be handled differently. By creating a buffering requirement along these boundaries, there is the opportunity to ensure more compatible development, maintain residential property values, and foster better relationships between these disparate neighbors. This may be accomplished, for example by the use of reduced lighting, harmonious colors, or non-flashing or rotating or blinking lights.

SECTION 19 - REAR LOTS 

19.1 
The intent of this section is to provide greater residential development flexibility, particularly where a site has an unusual lot line or natural resource configuration of where rear lot development would promote or enhance the protection of valuable natural resource features. This section is not intended to encourage development of land characterized by severe or very severe development limitations or to discourage new development and is limited to residential construction. 
19.1.1  No approval shall be granted authorizing construction on rear lots unless the applicants for such permits have demonstrated compliance with all of the following conditions to the satisfaction of the Commission: 
19.1.1.1  That such lot or lots provide the best development of the land, considering subject lot and lot configurations, topography and other natural resources, characteristics, drainage and traffic impacts, and driveway site lines 
19.1.1.2  That any proposed Rear Lot development is not detrimental to the health, safety, general welfare, property values, future land use or road layouts of the future occupants of rear lot or lots, abutting landowners or the community at large and shall not impair future land use and road layouts anticipated by the Master Plan of Development. 
19.1.1.3  That there is no logical or feasible alternate for the lot or subdivision to be properly served by an accepted Town road, street or highway in the foreseeable future. 
19.1.2  If rear lots are proposed in subdivisions, the incidence of rear lots shall not exceed the greater of one (1) lot or ten percent (10%) of the number of lots for which subdivision approval is sought. 
19.1.3  Rear lot applications shall be considered as special situations, each requiring individual justification by the applicant. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate how special circumstances make a specific rear lot development proposal consistent with this section and how it will avoid adverse effects on surrounding land. 
19.2 - All rear lots require approval of the Commission. 
Those lots, which do not require subdivision approval, must apply for and receive a Special Permit from the Planning & Zoning Commission. All applications for a subdivision or Special Permit must meet the following requirements: 
19.2.1  The provision of an unobstructed right of access (aka access strip) in fee simple, at least twenty-five (25) feet wide at all points to a public street and designed to accommodate emergency vehicles, etc., to such lot. If however the rear of such lot shall exceed twice the area requirements of the zone in which the rear area is located, such access strip to said area shall be at least fifty (50) feet wide to all points (to provide for future roadway development) and no building permit shall be issued for more than one building in the original rear area until all regulations for subdivision have been complied with. 
19.2.2  The rear lot line of the primary lot and that from which the access strip for the rear lot originates, shall be considered the front yard line of the rear lot. 
19.2.3  The access strip shall not be used in computing lot size area requirements. 
19.2.4  No access strip shall exceed five-hundred (500) feet from the centerline of the traveled portion of any street. 
19.2.5  Rear lots more than twenty-five (25) acres in area shall have two (2) access strips spaced a minimum distance of six-hundred (600) feet apart with all measurements taken from the midpoint of the access strip(s). 
19.2.6  The maximum number of adjoining rear lot access strips shall not exceed two (2) and a common driveway shall be employed. 
19.2.7  The minimum separation distance, as measured along one side of the street, between single rear lots shall be three hundred fifty (350) feet. The minimum separation distance between adjoining access strips sharing a common driveway and any other access strip(s) shall be six hundred (600) feet. All measurements shall be from the midpoint of the access strip(s). 
19.2.8  The Commission shall require written reports as for each rear lot from the Chief of Police and the Fire Marshal as to the feasibility of rear access to each proposed dwelling and accessory buildings from the point of view of fire and police protection. 
19.2.9  Parking on the access strip shall be prohibited to permit unrestricted entry of emergency vehicles. 
19.2.10  An unobstructed vehicular turnaround with at least a forty-five (45) foot radius shall be provided at the dwelling to accommodate emergency vehicles. 
19.2.11  To ensure a buildable area exists on the rear lot, at least fifty (50) percent of the minimum lot area required shall be "developable", as defined in Section 2 of the Zoning Regulations. 
19.3 
In order to approve a subdivision containing rear lots or a Special Permit for a rear lot the Commission shall find: 
19.3.1  That the development of rear lots will provide the most suitable use of the land considering such factors as drainage, natural resources configuration, accessibility, and topography and 
19.3.2  The rear lot(s) shall not present any problems with the provision of emergency services and 
19.3.3  All the requirements of the Zoning and/or Subdivision Regulations are met.

SECTION 23 - COMMERCIAL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SITES 

23.1 - Background and Purpose: 
Recent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of telecommunication services. These new services transmit radio waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations. These antennas may be located on buildings, water towers, and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers. This requires that the Town of Vernon regulate these wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers, which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances. 
A number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the Federal Communications Commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future. These firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the Town of Vernon and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers and antennas. 
The intent of the Regulation is to provide for the establishment and/or expansion of cellular telephone, mobile radio and personal communication systems within the Town of Vernon while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunication facilities through careful design, siting, and screening. More specifically this regulations has been developed in order to: 
23.1.1  Maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the Community. 
23.1.2  Encourage providers to co-locate their facilities on a single site; 
23.1.3  Site facilities below visually prominent ridge lines; 
23.1.4  Minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas; 
23.1.5  Encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities; 
23.1.6  Protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication towers; 
23.1.7  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
23.2 - Location Preferences: 
The locations for siting the equipment involved in receiving or transmitting radio waves associated with commercial wireless telecommunication services are listed in paragraphs 1 through 5 below, in order of preference. 
23.2.1  On existing structures such as buildings, water towers, and utility poles. 
23.2.2  On existing or approved towers.

24.8.6  Parking: 
24.8.6.1  General: 
24.8.6.1.1  The intent of these parking regulations is to encourage a balance between compact pedestrian oriented development and necessary car storage. The goal is to construct neither more nor less parking than is needed. 
24.8.6.1.2  On-street parking is permitted throughout the district except where posted otherwise. Parking need not be contiguous with the building or the use it serves. 
24.8.6.1.3  Minimum parking requirements in the RVDOZ are as follows: 
1 space/dwelling unit. 
1 space/300 sf of retail. 
1 space/300 sf of office. 
24.8.6.1.4  Shared parking solutions are encouraged. Required parking minimums can be reduced by up to 50% with a shared parking solution approved by the PZC. The applicant shall provide a parking analysis justifying the proposed shared parking solution. 
24.8.6.1.5  Minimum parking space dimensions for head-in or diagonal parking shall be 9'×17' with 10 foot drive lanes (20' for 2 way traffic) and parallel parking spaces shall be 8'x20' minimum with 10 foot drive lanes (20' for 2 way traffic). 
24.8.6.1.6  Parking shall be provided as necessary to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
24.8.6.2  On-Street Parking. 
The selection of diagonal, head-in, or parallel parking along any section of road shall be determined in consultation with the Town Engineer and Town Planner. 
24.8.6.3  Off-Street Surface Parking Lot Placement. 
Off-street surface parking lots shall be setback a minimum of 10 feet from the sidewalk line. 
24.8.6.4  Access to Off-Street Parking.

24.8.6.4.2  Circular drives are prohibited except for civic buildings. Where space permits, garage doors shall face the side or the rear property lines, not the front. 
24.8.6.4.3  Off-street parking areas in front of new buildings are not permitted. Off-street parking areas in front of existing buildings shall be discouraged wherever alternative parking solutions exist. 
24.8.7  Street Trees. 
Streets bordering new development or substantial rehabilitation shall be planted with street trees. Trees shall be selected and arranged in consultation with the DRC. Street trees should be at least 3" in caliper at chest height. 
24.8.8  Street Lighting. 
Street lighting shall be provided on all streets bordering new development or substantial rehabilitation. Street light fixtures should be located within 3 feet of the curb and should be provided at consistent regular intervals. Street light fixtures shall be chosen in consultation with the DRC. 
24.8.9  Street Furniture. 
Street furniture includes benches, trash receptacles, street signs and traffic lights. Street furniture shall be chosen in consultation with the DRC. Benches and trash receptacles shall be provided on all streets at consistent regular intervals. Street furniture shall be located so as to maintain a clear pedestrian path. Street furniture should be consistent in color and style along both sides of any street. A five foot wide street furniture strip should be set aside and maintained. 
24.8.10  Drainage. 
24.8.10.1  Stormwater control measures shall be provided for impervious surfaces within the site, either as stipulated below or in other situations as deemed appropriate by the PZC. All storm water control structures shall be reviewed, approved, and inspected by the Town Engineer. 
24.8.10.2  All storm drainage for proposed development in which the combined square footage of roofs, paved parking areas and other impervious surfaces exceeds 10,000 square feet shall be designed in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Town LID Manual. 
24.8.11  Access & Traffic. 
24.8.11.1  The PZC may require the applicant to present a traffic survey conducted by a qualified traffic engineer evaluating the impact of the anticipated traffic on fire safety and congestion of traffic flow on the public roadway, and on pedestrian use in front of the property. The PZC may require such measures as are necessary to ensure pedestrian and vehicular safety and ease of travel, including limiting access to and from the parking area to right turns only, and requiring other measures to enhance visibility for persons exiting from the parking area and for drivers and pedestrians on the public roadways. 
24.8.11.2  The PZC may require minimum sight line distances depending on present or anticipated traffic conditions and upon posted speed limits and surveyed average vehicular speeds. 
24.8.11.3  Vehicular entrances shall be a maximum of 25 feet wide and shall be clearly defined. Vehicular entrances shall not exceed 30% of the lot frontage. The total number of entrances which can safely be accommodated along the same road will be a consideration for approval or disapproval of a special permit and/or site plan application. Wherever possible, each development shall be limited to one access point per property on the same road. Shared entrances are encouraged. 
24.8.11.4  The applicant must demonstrate that the site design makes proper provision for pedestrian access and safety. All site plans shall provide for pedestrian walkways and circulation in and around buildings. Pedestrian pathways allowing access from the sidewalk to the primary building entrances are required. 
24.8.12  Civic Sites. 
24.8.12.1  Civic buildings include, but are not limited to, municipal buildings, churches, libraries, schools, recreation facilities, and places of assembly. Civic buildings do not include retail buildings, residential buildings, or privately owned office buildings. Traditionally, civic buildings have greater front yard setbacks and building frontage requirements; therefore civic buildings are not subject to set back requirements or building frontage requirements. Civic buildings should be set farther back from the street than non-civic buildings in the district.
