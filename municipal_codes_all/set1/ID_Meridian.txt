1.Metal finishing subcategory of 40 CFR part 433.11(e) provides a definition for the term TTO as to mean the total toxic organics, which is the
summation of all quantifiable values greater than 0.01 milligrams per liter for the listed toxic organics identified in 40 CFR part 433.11(e). See list of
organic chemicals included in total toxic organics (TTO) regulated under electroplating and metal finishing categories maintained at the Meridian
POTW.
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are
for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant,
the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.
The following pollutants are regulated to ensure compliance with the city of Meridian NPDES permit. Higher concentration levels of wastewater
discharge for the following are subject to subsection 9-4-9C1 of this title:
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
Chemical oxygen demand (COD)
Phosphorus
Total suspended solids (TSS)
(Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city of Meridian shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city of
Meridian for review and shall be acceptable to the city of Meridian before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the
city of Meridian under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-2-9: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective
unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city of Meridian shall also establish a final compliance deadline for
any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more
restrictive than the federal categorical pretreatment standards.
New source and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety
(90) days from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution
control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline established in EPA's
categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit which is in
noncompliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance
within the shortest time feasible. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

that certain wastewater be discharged only to specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and other such conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.
B. Each user discharging into the POTW greater than ten thousand (10,000) gallons per day, shall install and maintain, on its property and its
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty four (24) hour period. The facility shall have a
capacity for at least twenty five percent (25%) of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge
controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the superintendent or designee. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for
flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent or designee, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, and sand, except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interceptor units shall be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent or designee and shall be located to be
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
its expense.

the user's cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation. The city of Meridian shall determine which user is required
to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted sixty (60) days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as
submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city of Meridian. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
A. Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
1. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic chemicals (including solvents), and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
B. The user shall immediately telephone and notify the wastewater treatment plant of the incident regulated by this chapter. The notification shall
include the location of the discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user
shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under state or federal law.
C. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent or designee, a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
D. Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or
accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with respect to emergency
notification procedures. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

9-2-5: SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
9-2-5-1: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
A. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. The samples must be representative of the discharge and the
decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four
(24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the sample may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the superintendent or designee, as appropriate.
B. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do
not exist. For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent or designee may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the superintendent or designee shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess
and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
C. Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by the city of Meridian and specified in the user's wastewater
discharge permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastewater formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate
compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city of Meridian has adjusted its local limits to factor out
dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s).
D. All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that the waste stream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than
was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-5-2: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for
the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-
2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-5-3: CITY MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The city of Meridian will follow the same procedures as outlined in sections 9-2-5-1 and 9-2-5-2 of this chapter. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-
18-2008)
9-2-6: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
9-2-6-1: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The city of Meridian shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the
superintendent or designee ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying,
and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification the superintendent, or designee, will
be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The superintendent or designee shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.

C. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent or designee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the user.
D. Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent or designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 08-
1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-6-2: MONITORING FACILITIES:
Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of each sewer
discharge to the city of Meridian. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises, except, where such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the city of Meridian may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The superintendent or designee,
whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a
manufacturing line or a wastewater treatment system).
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
The superintendent or designee may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-6-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the superintendent or designee has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of
the city of Meridian designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the superintendent or designee shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure
warrant from the court of proper jurisdiction located in Ada County, Idaho. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the superintendent
or designee in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city of Meridian. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-6-4: VANDALISM:
No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter.
(Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-7: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits,
monitoring programs, city of Meridian inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent or designee, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-8: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The city of Meridian shall publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets
one or more of the following criteria:
A. "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined here as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater
measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
B. "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined here as those in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1/2 for all other pollutants except pH);
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 203/415
C. Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, longer term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with any discharges, interference or
pass-through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
D. Any discharge of pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has caused the superintendent or
designee to exercise its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
9-2-9-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the superintendent or designee finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent or designee may serve upon that user a
written notice of violation (via certified letter). Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent or
designee. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent or designee to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The superintendent or designee may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders
issued pursuant to sections 9-2-9-4 and 9-2-9-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The superintendent or designee may order via a certified letter a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent
or designee and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show
cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the superintendent or designee finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent or designee may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in that order. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance
of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-
2008)
9-2-9-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the superintendent or designee finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 204/415
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
superintendent or designee may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
A. When the superintendent or designee finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent or designee may fine such
user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis.
In the case of monthly or other term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of one percent (1%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for
unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent or designee to reconsider the fine along with full payment
of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent or designee shall convene
a hearing on the matter within ten (10) days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city of Meridian may add costs of preparing administrative
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-
2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
The superintendent or designee may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent or designee may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity
to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. The
city shall have the authority to physically cap, block or seal the user's sewer line (whether on public or private property) in order to terminate
service under this section. The city shall have the right to enter upon the user's property to accomplish the capping, blocking or sealing of the
user's sewer line. The city may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon clear and convincing proof by the user of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge or condition creating the threat as set forth above.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent or designee shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize danger to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to
any individuals. The superintendent or designee shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city of Meridian that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 9-2-9-8 of this
chapter are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent or designee
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing in sections 9-2-9-3 and 9-2-9-8 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-
2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-9-8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (NONEMERGENCY):
In addition to the provisions contained in section 9-2-12 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
A. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 205/415
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 9-2-2 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 9-2-3 of this
chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city of Meridian shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

9-2-10-1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the superintendent or designee finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent or designee may petition the fourth
judicial district court of Ada County, Idaho, through the city of Meridian's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The superintendent or designee may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-10-2: CIVIL PENALTIES:
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city of Meridian for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
B. The superintendent or designee may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city of Meridian.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of
harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008,
eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-10-3: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
A user which has wilfully or recklessly violated any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be prosecuted and punished accordingly.
In addition, a user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who
falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be prosecuted and punished accordingly. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

9-2-11-2: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense,
after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-12: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
9-2-12-1: UPSET:
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance,
or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection C of this section are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs,
or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent or designee within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 working days):
a. A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 08-1353,
3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-12-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in subsections 9-2-2-
1A and B and sections 9-2-2-2 through 9-2-2-4 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: a) a local limit exists for each
pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or b) no local
limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-12-3: BYPASS:
A. Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
BYPASS: The intentional or unintentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.
Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 207/415
B. Bypass Without Violation: A user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be
violated, but only for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections C and
D of this section.
C. Notice Of Bypass:
1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent or designee, at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case by case basis if
the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
D. Bypass Conditions:
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section.
2. The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)
9-2-13: WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES:
Wastewater treatment rates and charges shall be set by resolution of the Meridian city council. (Ord. 08-1353, 3-18-2008, eff. 3-18-2008)

If the user or owner disputes a sewer connection fee or monthly user charge, the user or owner may request a hearing before the board of
adjustment pursuant to the procedures set forth in title 2, chapter 8 of this code pertaining to the board of adjustment in order that the parcel being
subject to sewer connection, charge, periodic user charge, or other fees as provided for in section 9-4-23 of this chapter be appraised and
assessed by the board of adjustment for the purpose of establishing the equivalent connection rating, the sewer connection charge, the inspection
fee, the monthly service charge or other fees to be charged or assessed to and against such property. In making such appraisement and
assessment, there shall be taken into consideration the area of land being served and the amount of flow (Q), the biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), the suspended solids (SS) and any other pertinent components of the wastes that the user is contributing to the system so as to establish,
as nearly as possible, the rate, charge or fee for each property on the same relative basis as is imposed upon like property and uses within the city
that has or will receive the sewer service. This procedure may also be used to determine the initial charges set forth herein or to change or modify
the initial charges. (Ord. 10-1469, 12-21-2010, eff. 12-27-2010)

9-4-23: BASIS FOR SEWER CHARGES:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 218/415
A. System Of Charges Established: There is hereby established a system of assessment fees, user charges, permit, review and inspection fees,
periodic service charges and other fees for the use of, and for service rendered by the sewer works of the City. The rates, charges and fees
provided by this chapter are hereby levied and assessed against each lot, parcel of land, building or property having any connection with the
sanitary sewer works of the City or otherwise discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastewater or other liquids directly into the sanitary sewer
works of the City. The rates, charges and fees shall be billed to and paid by the owner of each lot, parcel of land, building or property served by
the sewer system.
B. Properties Subject To Charges: It is specifically enacted that all property in the City to which a public sewer is available and is required to
connect to the sewer as required in section 9-4-8 of this chapter, but is not used by the owner or occupier of said parcel of land, is still subject
to user charges under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 04-1105, 10-5-2004)
9-4-24: WASTEWATER USER CHARGES:
Wastewater user charges are comprised of base fees, use fees, and assessment fees.
A. Wastewater Base Fees:
1. To cover the fixed costs of the wastewater system, each account is charged a monthly flat base fee.
a. The wastewater base fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
B. Wastewater Use Fees: Monthly use fees for wastewater collection (sewer) and treatment in the City are based on gallons of water collected and
treated as determined by water meter readings for the water used (delivered to the same building/account). The fee per gallon of use shall be
established by resolution of the City Council. Wastewater use is determined according to the following:
1. Residential Accounts: There are two (2) time periods during which wastewater use is determined during the year:
a. Winter Period: During four (4) winter months between November and March, wastewater use is based on monthly gallons of water
delivered as determined by water meter readings. Example: If five thousand (5,000) gallons of water were delivered then five thousand
(5,000) gallons of wastewater use will be billed for that month. Depending on the account billing cycle, the four (4) months that comprise
the winter period will either be November through February, or December through March.
b. Summer Period: During the months outside an account's winter period, wastewater use is also based on monthly gallons of water
delivered until the amount of water delivered reaches the account's wastewater use cap (see subsection B1b(1) of this section). If monthly
water delivered is higher than the account's wastewater use cap, then the wastewater use cap serves as the month's wastewater use for
billing. Example: If nine thousand (9,000) gallons of water were delivered, but the wastewater use cap for the account is six thousand
(6,000) gallons, then six thousand (6,000) gallons of wastewater use will be billed. The wastewater use cap is calculated/applied as
follows:
(1) Wastewater Use Cap: The wastewater use cap is the average monthly number of gallons of water that were delivered to the account
during the winter period.
(2) Default Wastewater Use Cap: In any instance where the customer's wastewater use cap calculates to less than one thousand (1,000)
gallons per month or there is no customer data to calculate a wastewater use cap, a default wastewater use cap shall be applied. The
default wastewater use cap shall be established by resolution of City Council and is intended to represent the monthly wastewater use of
a typical residential account.
(3) Adjusted Wastewater Use Cap: Upon request, the wastewater use cap may be reviewed and evaluated. Determination of applicability
will be made by the City Public Works Director or designee and include an evaluation of current and potential water and sewer uses at
the property and to determine if the application of an adjusted wastewater use cap will result in fair wastewater billing.
2. Commercial Accounts: Wastewater use fees for all other users such as commercial and industrial are based on actual monthly water
delivered as determined by water meter readings.
a. Commercial accounts that show a residential pattern of water and wastewater use may be eligible for an applied wastewater use cap
during the summer period as set forth in the section for residential accounts. Determination of applicability will be made by the City Public
Works Director or designee and include an evaluation of current and potential water and sewer uses at the property to determine if the
application of a wastewater use cap will result in fair wastewater billing.
b. Commercial accounts with water uses that are not collected in the sewer may be eligible for periodic adjustment to the wastewater portion
of their bill if the amount of water used but not collected can be demonstrated.
C. Wastewater Assessment Fees:
1. Wastewater assessment fees for all newly established or upgraded sewer services shall be established by resolution of City Council. The
assessment fees for all uses other than single-family residential, shall be based on the number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) listed in
table 2 of this subsection, unless other acceptable means of determining ERUs are used. Other acceptable means may include the Plumbing
Code "fixture unit" method or examination and analysis of historical consumption records of similar facilities within or outside the City of
Meridian. Single family residential assessment fees shall be based on one ERU.

Chapter 6
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
10-6-1: FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
A. Statutory Authority: The legislature of the state of Idaho in Idaho Code 46-1020 through 46-1024, authorizes local government units to adopt a
floodplain map and floodplain management ordinance that identifies floodplains and that sets forth minimum development requirements in
floodplains that are designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
B. Findings Of Fact:
1. The special flood hazard areas of the city of Meridian are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life, property damage,
hazard to health and safety, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are aggravated by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood elevations.
Development that is inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contributes to flood losses.
C. Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 245/415
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
7. To ensure that information regarding the location of special flood hazard areas is readily available to potential property buyers and other
interested people; and
8. To ensure that those who occupy special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for managing
development in flood prone areas to ensure that:
1. Structures are designed and built to acceptable standards to be protected from flooding, and
2. Development does not increase the potential for flood damage by elevating floodwater above regulatory limits. (Ord. 13-1584, 12-17-2013,
eff. 1-1-2014)
10-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below for purposes of this chapter only, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them
the meanings they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL: A request to city council to overrule a permit denial because the applicant claims that the ordinance has been incorrectly interpreted.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the "regulatory
flood", or "100-year flood".
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The water surface elevation during the base flood in relation to a specified datum. The base flood elevation
(BFE) is depicted on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) to the nearest foot and in the flood insurance study (FIS) to the nearest one-tenth of a
foot (0.1').
BASEMENT: Any portion of a structure, including crawl space, with its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings or other
structures, or the construction of substantial improvements to buildings or other structures; the placement of mobile homes; mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials; and the deposition or extraction of materials;
specifically including the construction of dikes, berms, dams and levees. The term "development" does not include the operation, cleaning,
maintenance or repair of any ditch, canal, lateral, drain, diversion structure or other irrigation or drainage works that is performed or authorized by
the owner thereof pursuant to lawful rights and obligations.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE, FINAL: The approved FEMA elevation certificate identified as FEMA form 81-31, completed prior to the city of
Meridian approval of the certification of occupancy. The final elevation certificate is identified by the completion of the "finished construction" item
in section C.1 of the current FEMA form.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE, INTERIM: The approved FEMA elevation certificate identified as FEMA form 81-31, completed prior to the city of
Meridian approval of the foundation inspection. The interim elevation certificate is identified by the completion of the "building under construction"
item in section C.1 of the current FEMA form.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map of a community, issued by the federal insurance administration delineating the special
flood hazard areas and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS): The official report provided by the federal insurance administration evaluating flood hazards and containing
flood profiles, floodway boundaries and water surface elevations of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
B. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The elevation above the base flood elevation to which the lowest floor of a structure must be elevated.
The flood protection elevation for the city of Meridian shall be two feet (2') above base flood elevation.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (Also Known As REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1'). Regulations
require that the floodway be kept open so that flood flows are not obstructed or diverted onto other properties. If the base flood is entirely
contained within the banks of a clearly defined channel, the entire channel may be defined as a floodway.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: A structure that is:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 246/415

usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a structure's lowest floor.
The lowest floor is a determinate for the flood insurance premium for a building, home or business.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MERIDIAN FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT: Area regulated by this section of code.
MERIDIAN FLOODWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT: Floodway portion of the Meridian floodplain overlay district regulated by this code.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Development for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.

days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure, or the scope of which increases the existing gross floor area by more than twenty
percent (20%) before the "start of construction" of the improvement. If a substantial improvement is being made to a structure, the entire structure
must be brought into compliance with the provisions of this code. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage",
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
B. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
this chapter. (Ord. 13-1584, 12-17-2013, eff. 1-1-2014)

6-2 of this chapter within the jurisdiction of the city.
B. Basis For Establishing The Meridian Floodplain Overlay District And The Meridian Floodway Overlay District:
1. The Meridian floodplain overlay district is initially defined by overlaying the FEMA effective FIRM SFHA onto digital maps and amending it
through engineering hydraulic analysis, or by surveys to correct inconsistencies with field conditions, then applying a ten foot (10') horizontal
buffer to expand the area. Amendments to the district due to hydraulic analysis or field surveys shall be reviewed and made available by the
floodplain administrator. The Meridian floodplain overlay district will always include at least the SFHA as depicted on the FEMA effective
FIRM and shall not be decreased by FEMA letters of map revisions based on fill (LOMR-F).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 247/415
2. The Meridian floodway overlay district is initially defined by overlaying a FEMA mapped floodway or a local floodway defined by subsection
10-6-5B of this chapter onto digital maps and amending it through engineering hydraulic analysis, or by surveys to correct inconsistencies
with field conditions, then applying a five foot (5') horizontal buffer to expand the area. Amendments to the district due to hydraulic analysis
or field surveys shall be reviewed and made available by the floodplain administrator. The Meridian floodway overlay district will always
include at least the floodway mapped by FEMA shown on the effective FIRM.
C. Basis For Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas: The special flood hazard areas identified by the federal emergency management agency
(FEMA) in its flood insurance study (FIS) and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and/or digital flood insurance rate maps
(DFIRM) for Ada County, Idaho, and incorporated areas entitled "Flood Insurance Study For Ada County, Idaho And Incorporated Areas"
effective October 2, 2003 (FIS number 16001CV000B), are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter together with
any subsequent revisions thereof. The flood insurance study and flood insurance rate map(s) are on file in the office of the floodplain
administrator. (Ord. 13-1584, 12-17-2013, eff. 1-1-2014)
D. Penalties For Noncompliance: No development shall take place without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply
with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to penalty as provided in section 1-2-1 of this code for each violation, and
in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case, including attorney fees. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 14-1620, 8-19-2014)
E. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes
the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. Additionally, in the event that any of the requirements of this chapter are in conflict with those of 44
CFR parts 59 - 65, the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
F. Severability: This chapter is hereby declared to be severable. Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect and shall be read to carry out the purpose of this chapter before
declaration of partial invalidity.
G. Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
H. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased
by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof,
or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 13-1584, 12-17-2013, eff. 1-1-2014)

conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter.
d. Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a
physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial
circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods.
e. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that the development will be
permitted without meeting city code requirements and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk of flood
damage. (Ord. 13-1584, 12-17-2013, eff. 1-1-2014)
10-6-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
A. Standards For The Meridian Floodplain Overlay District:
1. Engineering And Mapping Requirements:
a. Determination Of Base Flood Elevations (BFEs): The floodplain development permit applicant shall first contact the city floodplain
administrator to determine the base flood elevation. If the floodplain administrator is unable to determine the base flood elevation through
FEMA profiles and/or simplified methods, then the floodplain development permit applicant shall retain the services of a qualified State of
Idaho licensed professional engineer, or professional land surveyor to determine BFEs before and after the proposed development. BFEs
shall be determined based on FIRMs, previous studies, by performing a hydraulic analysis, or other methods approved by the Floodplain
Administrator. The engineer or surveyor must check with the Floodplain Administrator to determine if additional updated information on
BFEs is available.
b. Effect Of Development On BFE: In areas where FEMA has not determined a floodway, the cumulative effect of any proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point unless letter of map change (LOMC) provisions in 44 CFR part 65 are met. It is the
responsibility of the City acting through the Floodplain Administrator to allocate the one foot (1') increase to best serve the purposes and
objectives of this chapter.
c. Floodway Mapping: In floodplains where the floodway has not been mapped by FEMA, the floodplain development permit applicant shall
retain the services of a qualified State of Idaho licensed professional engineer to determine the location of a local floodway. Development
in the Meridian Floodway Overlay District shall then meet the standards for development specified in subsection B of this section.
d. Electronic Map/Drawing Submittal: The floodplain development permit applicant shall provide paper and electronic submittals, including
drawings showing newly mapped floodplain and floodway as well as model input files and input/output tables. Electronic map and drawing
submittals shall be submitted according to the City of Meridian AutoCAD standards.
2. Construction Requirements For New Construction And Substantial Improvements Of Structures:
a. Elevation Requirements:
(1) For all residential construction and new nonresidential construction the lowest floor elevation of any structure, including basements, or
mobile/manufactured homes, shall be elevated to the flood protection elevation of no less than two feet (2') above the base flood
elevation.
(2) For all residential construction and new nonresidential construction, any crawl space or other unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement, is not
considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to the following:

Chapter 7
IMPACT FEES
10-7-1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS:
The city council of the city of Meridian, Idaho, finds that:
A. Based on the city of Meridian comprehensive plan adopted by the city pursuant to title 67, chapter 65, Idaho Code, including, but not limited to,
the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and its area of city impact, it is necessary that the city's public facilities for: 1) park and recreation public
facilities; and 2) public safety public facilities for law enforcement and fire to accommodate new growth and development within the city, and its
area of city impact.
B. New residential and nonresidential growth and development imposes and will impose increasing demands upon the public facilities.
C. The revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential growth and development often do not generate sufficient general funds to
provide the necessary improvements of these public facilities to accommodate new growth and development.
D. New growth and development are expected to continue, and will place ever increasing demands on the city to provide and expand the public
facilities to serve new growth and development.
E. The city has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in the capital improvements element of the city of Meridian comprehensive plan.
F. The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of needed improvements to
the public facilities to accommodate new growth and development, and would assist the city in implementing the capital improvements element
of the comprehensive plan.
G. In order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the public facilities, the city retained BBC Research & Consulting to prepare an impact
fee study for these types of facilities. The resulting document titled "The City Of Meridian Impact Fee Study And Capital Improvements Plan",
dated August 28, 2006 (the "impact fee study"), recommended for approval by the impact fee advisory committee, is on file in the office of the
city clerk of the city of Meridian.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 252/415
H. The impact fee study is consistent with the capital improvements element of the city of Meridian comprehensive plan, and uses the levels of
service set forth in the comprehensive plan for these public facilities.
I. The impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new growth and
development on the public facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for
such public facilities created by new growth and development.
J. The impact fee study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is net of credits for the
present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated
to be available to pay for system improvements, including taxes, assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers, and included
consideration of the following factors:
1. The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
2. The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
3. The extent to which the new growth and development will contribute to the cost of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or
developer or landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements through developer or landowner
contributions;
4. The extent to which the new growth and development is required to contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
5. The extent to which the new growth and development should be credited for providing system improvements, without charge to other
properties within the service area;
6. Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new growth and development;
7. The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of impact fees paid at different times; and
8. The availability of other sources of funding system improvements including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, transfers, and
special taxation.
K. The maximum allowable impact fees described in this chapter are based on the impact fee study, and do not exceed the costs of system
improvements for the public facilities to serve new growth and development that will pay the impact fees.
L. The police, fire, and parks and recreation public facilities included in the calculation of impact fees in the impact fee study will benefit all new
growth and development throughout the city, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city and the area of city impact as a single
service area for purposes of calculating, collecting and spending the impact fees collected.
M. There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by
this chapter and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
N. This chapter creates a system by which impact fees paid by new growth and development will be used to finance, defray or to provide capital
improvements for the public facilities in ways that benefit the development for which impact fees were paid.
O. This chapter creates a system under which impact fees shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies in public facilities, or to replace or
rehabilitate existing public facilities, or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those public facilities.
P. This chapter is consistent with all applicable provisions of title 67, chapter 82, Idaho Code, concerning impact fee ordinances. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-
5-2006)
10-7-2: AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY, AND EFFECTIVE DATE:

10-7-3: INTENT:
A. The intent of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city and its area of city impact.
B. The intent of this chapter is to be consistent with those principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of capital improvements to public facilities
to serve new growth and development in compliance with the provisions set forth in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code. The provisions of this
chapter shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 67-8201 et seq., Idaho Code.
C. The intent of this chapter is that impact fees should be charged, collected, and expended for police, fire, and parks and recreation capital
improvements to increase the service capacity of such categories of public facilities, which capital improvements are included in approved
capital improvements plans that list the capital improvements that may be funded with impact fees.
D. The intent of this chapter is to ensure that: Public facilities are available to serve new growth and development; new growth and development
bears a proportionate share of the cost of police, fire, and parks and recreation capital improvements to such public facilities; such
proportionate share does not exceed the cost of the capital improvements to such public facilities required to serve new growth and
development; and the funds collected from new growth and development are used for capital improvements for public facilities that benefit new
growth and development.
E. It is not the intent of this chapter to collect any monies from new growth and development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset
new demands for capital improvements to public facilities created by such new growth and development.
F. It is not the intent of this chapter that the impact fees be used to remedy any deficiency in police, fire, and parks and recreation capital
improvements existing on the effective date hereof, or ever be used to replace, rehabilitate, maintain and/or operate any public facilities.
G. It is not the intent of this chapter that any monies collected from an impact fee deposited in an impact fee fund ever be commingled with monies
from a different fund, or ever be used for capital improvements that are different from those for which the impact fee was paid.

existing development.
5. Administrative and operating costs of the city unless such costs are attributable to development of the capital improvements plans used to
determine impact fees by a surcharge imposed by ordinance on the collection of an impact fee, which surcharge shall not exceed a
development's proportionate share of the cost of preparing the capital improvements plans.
6. Principal payments and interest or other finance charges on bonds or other indebtedness except financial obligations issued by or on behalf
of the city to finance capital improvements identified in the capital improvements plans. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)

10-7-5: IMPOSITION AND COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES:
A. Any application for a building permit enabling the construction, and in the case of construction that does not require a building permit, any
building that takes place on or after the effective date of this chapter shall be subject to the imposition of impact fees in the manner and amount
set forth in this chapter. The methodology adopted for the purpose of determining police, fire, and parks and recreation impact fees shall be
based upon the assumptions set forth in the impact fee study.
B. Impact fees shall be required as a condition of approval of all residential and nonresidential development in the service area for which a building
permit is required and shall be payable prior to the issuance of any building permit (or installation permit in the case of a manufactured home)
for a dwelling unit or a nonresidential building. Except as otherwise provided herein, after the effective date of this chapter, no building permit
shall be issued until the impact fees described in this chapter have been paid, unless the development for which the permit is sought is
exempted by section 10-7-8 of this chapter or approved credits are used to cover the impact fee, as set forth in section 10-7-9 of this chapter.
The fee administrator shall have the authority to withhold a building permit or stop construction, as the case may be, until the appropriate
impact fee has been collected.
C. A fee payer required by this chapter to pay an impact fee may choose to have the amount of such impact fee determined pursuant to either the
fee schedule or subsections D through F of this section. If the fee payer chooses to have the amount of such impact fee determined pursuant
to subsections D through F of this section, such impact fee shall be subject to the adjustment described in section 10-7-9 of this chapter, if
applicable. If the project is a mix of those uses listed on the fee schedule, then the impact fees shall be determined by adding up the impact
fees that would be payable for each use as if it were a freestanding use pursuant to the fee schedule.
D. Individual assessment of impact fees is permitted in situations where the fee payer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the
established impact fee is inappropriate for the project. Written application for individual assessment shall be made to the fee administrator at
any time prior to receiving building permit(s). Late applications for individual assessment of impact fees may be considered for a period of sixty
(60) days after the receipt of a building permit only if the fee payer makes a showing that the facts supporting such application were not known
or discoverable prior to receipt of a building permit and that undue hardship would result if said application is not considered. Such independent
impact fee calculation study for the fee payer's development shall be prepared at the fee payer's cost by a qualified professional and contain
studies, data and other relevant information and be submitted to the fee administrator for review. Any such study shall be based on the same
methodology and the same level of service standards, improvements and costs used in the impact fee study, and must document the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 256/415
methodologies and assumptions used. The city may hire a professional consultant to review any independent impact fee calculation study on
behalf of the city, and may charge the reasonable costs of such review to the fee payer.
E. Any independent impact fee calculation study submitted by a fee payer may be accepted, rejected or accepted with modifications by the city as
the basis for calculating impact fees. The city shall not be required to accept any study or documentation the city reasonably deems to be
inaccurate or unreliable, and shall have the authority to request that the fee payer submit additional or different documentation for consideration
in connection with review of any independent impact fee calculation. If such additional or different documentation is accepted or accepted with
modifications as a more accurate measure of the impact fees due in connection with fee payer's proposed development than the applicable
impact fees set forth in the fee schedule, then the impact fee due under this chapter shall be calculated according to such documentation.
F. The fee administrator shall render a written decision establishing the impact fees in connection with the individual assessment within thirty (30)
days of the date a complete application is submitted. The decision shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fees, shall
specify the system improvement(s) for which the impact fees are intended to be used, and shall include an explanation of the following factors
considered:
1. The cost of existing system improvements within the service area;
2. The means by which existing system improvements have been financed;
3. The extent to which the new growth and development will contribute to the cost of system improvements through taxation, assessment, or
developer or landowner contributions, or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements through developer or landowner
contributions;
4. The extent to which the new growth and development is required to contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future;
5. The extent to which the new growth and development should be credited for providing system improvements, without charge to other
properties within the service area;
6. Extraordinary costs, if any, incurred in serving the new growth and development;
7. The time and price differential inherent in a fair comparison of impact fees paid at different times; and
8. The availability of other sources of funding system improvements including, but not limited to, user charges, general tax levies, transfers, and
special taxation.
G. Certification of the impact fee for a project may be applied for in the following manner:
1. Written application may be made to the fee administrator not later than sixty (60) days after development approval by the city council. Late
applications for certification of the impact fee will not be considered unless the fee payer makes a showing that the facts supporting such
application were not known or discoverable until after the time had run and that undue hardship would result if said application is not
considered.
2. The fee administrator shall provide the fee payer with a written impact fee certification for the project within thirty (30) days of the date a
complete application is submitted. The certification provided by the fee administrator shall establish the impact fee for the project in question,
so long as there is no material change to the project as identified in the certification application or the impact fee schedule. The certification
shall include an explanation of factors considered, and shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the impact fee is intended to be
used.
The certification shall include an explanation of the calculation of the impact fee, shall specify the system improvement(s) for which the
impact fee is intended to be used, and shall include an explanation of the factors considered, which factors are identified in subsection F of
this section.
H. Appeals of the fee administrator's determination of an individual assessment or certification shall be made to the city as provided further in this
chapter.
I. The city recognizes that there may be circumstances where the anticipated fiscal impacts of a proposed development are of such magnitude that
the city may be unable to accommodate the development without excessive or unscheduled public expenditures that exceed the amount of the
anticipated impact fees from such development. If the city determines that a proposed development would create such an extraordinary impact
on the city's police, fire, and/or parks and recreation public facilities, the city may refuse to approve the proposed development. In the
alternative, the city may calculate a pro rata share per dwelling unit, or square feet of nonresidential buildings, of the extraordinary impact and
charge a reasonable extraordinary impact fee that is greater than would ordinarily be charged.
J. If the city discovers an error in its impact fee formula that results in assessment or payment of more than a proportionate share, city shall, at the
time of assessment on a case by case basis, adjust the impact fee to collect no more than a proportionate share or discontinue the collection of
any impact fees until the error is corrected by ordinance. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)
10-7-6: PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
A. After the effective date of this chapter all fee payers shall pay the impact fees as provided by this chapter to the fee administrator following
application for a building permit and prior to the issuance of any building permit for a dwelling unit, or nonresidential building.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 257/415
B. All impact fees paid by a fee payer pursuant to this chapter shall be promptly deposited in the impact fee fund described in section 10-7-7 of this
chapter. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)
10-7-7: IMPACT FEE FUNDS; REFUNDS OF IMPACT FEES PAID:
A. There is hereby established a police impact fee fund into which shall be deposited all police impact fees for the purpose of ensuring police
impact fees collected pursuant hereto are designated for the accommodation of police capital improvements reasonably necessary to serve
new growth and development that paid the impact fee.
B. There is hereby established a fire impact fee fund into which shall be deposited all fire impact fees for the purpose of ensuring fire impact fees
collected pursuant hereto are designated for the accommodation of fire capital improvements reasonably necessary to serve new growth and
development that paid the impact fee.
C. There is hereby established a parks and recreation impact fee fund into which shall be deposited all parks and recreation impact fees for the
purpose of ensuring parks and recreation impact fees collected pursuant hereto are designated for the accommodation of parks and recreation
capital improvements reasonably necessary to serve new growth and development that paid the impact fee.
D. Each fund shall be an interest bearing account which shall be accounted for separately from other impact fee funds and from other city funds.
Any interest or other income earned on monies deposited in a fund shall be credited to such fund. Expenditures of impact fees shall be made
only for the category of system improvements for which the impact fees were collected and as identified in the capital improvements plans.
E. Except as otherwise provided herein, monies from each fund, including any accrued interest, shall be limited to the financing of acquisition,
expansion, and/or improvement of capital improvements, or for principal and interest payments on bonds or other borrowed revenues used to
acquire, expand or improve such capital improvements, necessary to serve new growth and development. Impact fees in each fund shall be
spent within eight (8) years from the date such impact fees were collected on a first in/first out (FIFO) basis. The city may hold the impact fees
longer than the prescribed time period if the city identifies, in writing: 1) a reasonable cause why the impact fees should be held longer; and 2)
an anticipated date by which the impact fees will be expended but in no event longer than eleven (11) years from the date the impact fees were
collected.
F. The fee administrator shall prepare quarterly and annual reports to be provided to the advisory committee and the city council, which reports
shall: 1) describe the amount of all impact fees collected, appropriated or spent for system improvements during the preceding quarter or year,
as applicable, by category of public facility; and 2) describe the percentage of tax and revenues other than impact fees collected, appropriated
or spent for system improvements during the preceding quarter or year, as applicable, by category of public facility.
G. Funds shall be deemed expended when payment of such funds has been approved by the city. The fee payer or successor in interest shall be
entitled to a refund of the impact fee if: 1) service is available but never provided; 2) a building permit or permit for installation of a
manufactured home is revoked or abandoned; 3) the city, after collecting the impact fee when service is not available, has failed to appropriate
and expend the collected impact fees; or 4) the fee payer pays an impact fee under protest and a subsequent review of the impact fee paid or
the completion of an individual assessment determines that the impact fee paid exceeded the proportionate share to which the city was entitled
to receive.
H. When the right to a refund exists, within ninety (90) days after the city determines that a refund is due, the city shall provide written notice of
entitlement to a refund, to the owner of record and the fee payer who paid the impact fees at the address shown on the application for
development approval, or to a successor in interest who has notified the city of a transfer of the right or entitlement to a refund and who has
provided to the city a mailing address. When the right to a refund exists, the city shall also publish the notice of entitlement to a refund within
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the eight (8) year period after the date that the impact fees were collected. Such published notice shall
contain the heading "Notice of Entitlement to Impact Fee Refund".
I. A refund shall include interest at one-half (1/2) the legal rate provided for in section 28-22-104, Idaho Code, from the date on which the impact
fee was originally paid.
J. In order to be eligible for a refund, a fee payer, successor in interest or owner of record shall file a written application for a refund with the fee
administrator within six (6) months of the time such refund becomes payable under subsection E of this section, or within six (6) months of
publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. If a successor in interest claims a refund of impact fees, the fee
administrator may require written documentation that such rights have been transferred to the claimant prior to issuing the requested refund.
Refunds shall be paid within sixty (60) days after the date on which the fee administrator determines that a sufficient proof of claim for a refund
has been made.
K. Any person entitled to a refund shall have standing to sue for a refund under the provisions of this chapter if there has not been a timely
payment of a refund as provided herein. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 258/415
A. The following types of land development shall be exempted from payment of the impact fees imposed by this chapter:
1. Rebuilding or replacing a dwelling unit or the same amount of square feet of a nonresidential structure on the same lot and existing on the
effective date of this chapter provided that the rebuilt or replaced dwelling unit or nonresidential structure does not increase the need for
police, fire, and parks and recreation public facilities. If such dwelling unit or nonresidential structure was destroyed, such dwelling unit or
nonresidential structure must be rebuilt or replaced and ready for occupancy within two (2) years of destruction.
2. Construction of an unoccupied, detached accessory structure, or addition of uses related to a dwelling unit unless it can be clearly
demonstrated that the use creates a significant impact on the capacity of system improvements.
3. Remodeling or repairing a dwelling unit or a nonresidential structure in a manner that does not increase the need for police or fire or parks
and recreation public facilities.
4. Placing a temporary construction trailer or office on a lot.
B. An impact fee will be assessed for installation of a modular building or manufactured home unless the fee payer can demonstrate by
documentation such as utility bills and tax records, either: 1) that a modular building or manufactured home was legally in place on the lot or
space prior to the effective date of this chapter; or 2) that an impact fee has been paid previously for the installation of a modular building or
manufactured home on that same lot or space.
C. Developments determined by the city council that provide affordable housing may be exempt from the impact fee requirement, provided that the
exempt development's proportionate share of system improvements is funded through a revenue source other than impact fees.
1. Current housing affordability guidelines published by the U.S. department of housing and urban development ("HUD") shall be used to
determine whether dwelling units in the development qualify as affordable housing.
2. Affordable housing projects are required to demonstrate that they will provide dwelling units to eligible families based on HUD income and
family size guidelines.
3. Providers of affordable housing dwelling units must demonstrate a long term commitment to provide affordable housing for a period of not
less than twenty (20) years.
D. Appeals of the fee administrator's determination shall be made as provided further in this chapter. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)
10-7-9: CREDITS; REIMBURSEMENTS:
A. No fee payer shall be required to construct, fund or contribute any capital improvement to meet the same need for police, fire, and parks and
recreation capital improvements for which an impact fee is imposed. All system improvements constructed, funded or contributed for police,
fire, and parks and recreation capital improvements for which an impact fee is imposed, over and above those required by the city in
connection with new development, shall result in either a credit on future impact fees or reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) for such
excess to be paid by future development that benefits from such system improvements. However, no credit or reimbursement shall be provided
for: 1) project improvements; 2) any construction, funding or contribution not agreed to in writing by the city prior to commencement of such
construction, funding or contribution; and 3) any construction, funding or contribution of a type of capital improvements not included in the
calculation of the applicable impact fee.
B. In the calculation of impact fees for a project pursuant to subsections 10-7-5D through F of this chapter, credit shall be given for the present
value of all tax and user fee revenue generated by the fee payer within the service area and used by the city for system improvements of the
category for which the impact fee is being collected. If the amount of such credit exceeds the impact fee for a project, the fee payer shall
receive a credit on future impact fees.
C. In the calculation of impact fees for a project, credit or reimbursement (at the fee payer's option) shall be given for the present value of any
construction of system improvements or contribution of land or money required by the city from the fee payer for system improvements of the
category for which the impact fee is being collected, including system improvements paid for through local improvement district assessments.
D. If credit or reimbursement is due to the fee payer, the city and fee payer shall enter into a written agreement, negotiated in good faith, prior to
the construction, funding or contribution. The written agreement shall include, without limitation: a description of the construction, funding or
contribution of system improvements including, in the case of real property, a legal description of the real property; description as to how the
system improvements are to be valued; the amount of the credit or the amount, time and form of reimbursement; instructions as to how the
capital improvements should be provided to the city to ensure full transfer of ownership; and the circumstances under which the credit or
reimbursement is deemed effective. To assist in such reimbursement, the city shall continue to collect impact fees from other developers whose
proposed developments will benefit from such construction, funding or contribution, and will promptly transfer such funds to the fee payer. If a
successor in interest claims a reimbursement or credit, the fee administrator may require written documentation that such rights have been
conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested reimbursement or credit.
E. Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of impact fees of the category for which the impact fee is being collected in connection
with any new growth and development until the amount of the credit is exhausted. Each time a request to use approved credits is presented to
the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the applicable impact fee otherwise due from the fee payer and shall note in the city records the
amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the fee payer, the city shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available. If the credit
has not been exhausted within eight (8) years of the date of issuance of the first building permit for which an impact fee was due and payable,
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 259/415
or within such other time period as may be designated in writing by the city, such credit shall lapse, unless a refund of the remaining credit is
applied for as set forth in subsection 10-7-7J of this chapter.
F. Approved credits or reimbursement shall only be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee of the category for which the impact fee is
otherwise due, and shall not be paid to the fee payer in cash or in credits against any other monies due from the fee payer to the city.
G. Credit for land dedications shall, at the fee payer's option, be valued at: 1) one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for
such land as shown in the records of the Ada County assessor; or 2) that fair market value established by an MAI appraiser reasonably
acceptable to the city in an appraisal paid for by the fee payer. Credit for contribution or construction of system improvements shall be valued
by the city based on complete engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates submitted by the fee payer to the city,
which estimates shall be revised as actual costs become available. The city shall determine the amount of credit due based on the information
submitted, or, if the city determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or construction costs
reasonably acceptable to the city as a more accurate measure of the value of the offered system improvements to the city.
H. Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when the land has been conveyed to the city in a form reasonably acceptable to
the city at no cost to the city, and has been accepted by the city. Approved credits for contribution or construction of system improvements shall
generally become effective when: 1) all required construction has been completed and has been accepted by the city; and 2) all design,
construction, inspection, testing, bonding, and acceptance procedures have been completed in compliance with all applicable requirements of
the city. Approved credits for the construction of system improvements may become effective at an earlier date if the fee payer posts security in
the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement in the amount and under terms reasonably acceptable to the
city.
I. Credit may only be transferred by a fee payer that has received credit to such fee payer's successor in interest. The credit may be used only to
offset impact fees for the same category for which the credit was issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly
identifying which credits are being transferred, the dollar amount of the credit being transferred, and the system improvements for which the
credit was issued. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee, and a copy of the document shall be
delivered to the fee administrator for documentation of the transfer before the transfer shall be deemed effective. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)
10-7-10: APPEALS:
The decisions of the fee administrator may be appealed as provided below:
A. Any fee payer who is or may be obligated to pay an impact fee, may appeal a decision made by the fee administrator in applying this chapter to
the city council's designee. Such decisions that may be appealed include:
1. The applicability of an impact fee to the development.
2. The amount of an impact fee to be paid for the development.
3. The availability, amount or application of any credit.
4. The amount of any refund, reimbursement or credit.
A fee payer may pay an impact fee under protest in order to obtain a development approval or building permit(s) and, by paying such impact
fee, shall not be estopped from exercising the right of appeal provided herein, nor shall the fee payer be estopped from receiving a refund of
any amount deemed to have been illegally collected. Upon final disposition of an appeal, the impact fee shall be adjusted in accordance with
the decision rendered and, if necessary, a refund paid.
B. In order to pursue an appeal, the fee payer shall file a written notice of appeal with the city council's designee within fifteen (15) days after the
date of the decision being appealed, or the date on which the fee payer submitted a payment of impact fees under protest, whichever is later.
Such written application shall include a statement describing why the appellant believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of
any documents that the appellant believes supports the claim.
C. The city council's designee shall notify the fee payer of the hearing date on the appeal, which notice shall be given no less than fifteen (15)
days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall hear the appeal within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice of appeal. The appellant
shall have a right to be present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The fee administrator who made the decision under appeal
shall likewise have the right to be present and to present evidence in support of the decision. The burden of proof in any such hearing shall be
on the fee payer to demonstrate that the amount of the impact fee, credit, reimbursement or refund was not properly calculated by the city.
D. The criteria to be used by the city council's designee shall be whether: 1) the decision or interpretation made by the fee administrator; or 2) the
alternative decision or interpretation offered by the appellant, more accurately reflects the intent of this chapter that new growth and
development in the city pay its proportionate share of the costs of system improvements for public facilities necessary to serve new
development. The city council's designee may affirm, reject or revise the decision of the fee administrator, providing written findings of fact and
conclusions, within fifteen (15) days after hearing the appeal. The city council's designee shall modify the amount of the impact fee, credit,
refund or reimbursement only if there is substantial evidence in the record that the fee administrator erred, based upon the methodologies
contained in the impact fee study, this chapter and/or the capital improvements plans. The decision of the city council's designee shall be final.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 260/415
E. A fee payer may request that the city enter into mediation by a qualified independent party to address a disagreement related to the impact fee
for new growth and development. If both parties agree to mediation, costs for the independent mediation service shall be shared equally by the
fee payer and the city. Mediation may take place at any time during an appeals process and any time limitation relevant to an appeal shall be
tolled. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)
10-7-11: IMPACT FEE ADVISORY COMMITTEE:
The city has established an advisory committee. The advisory committee shall continue to be composed of not fewer than five (5) members
appointed by the city council. Two (2) or more members of the advisory committee shall be active in the business of development, building or real

The city shall make available to the advisory committee, upon request, all financial and accounting information, professional reports in relation
to other development and implementation of land use assumptions, the capital improvements plans and periodic updates of the capital
improvements plans. (Ord. 06-1255, 9-5-2006)

1. Structure height shall be measured in accord with the Meridian city building code as set forth in title 10, chapter 1 of this code.
2. Linear distance shall be measured in a horizontal line; it shall not be measured along an inclined surface or line. For uses that have a
separation standard, the distance shall be measured from the nearest customer entrance of the proposed use to the nearest property line of
the specified use. The measurement is to be conducted in a radial fashion by the specified number of feet (e.g., 300 feet, 1,000 feet).
3. The area of the sign background shall be computed by measuring the area enclosed by straight lines drawn to enclose the extremities of the
copy. When computing the area of sign background, only the face or faces that may be seen from one direction at one time shall be
considered. If a sign consists of individual letters, only the total area enclosed by straight lines drawn to enclose each letter shall be
computed as sign background area.
4. The height of a sign shall be computed by measuring the distance measured vertically from the top of curb of the abutting street (or, where
no curb exists, from the edge of pavement) to the highest point of the sign or visual appurtenance(s). The height of any landscape berm or
other structure erected to support or ornament the sign shall be measured as part of the sign height. This allowance does not apply to streets
that are part of a freeway interchange or overpass.
5. For residential subdivision identification signs, sign height applies only to that portion of a structure which is physically supporting the sign
background area. Other architectural elements primarily related to an entry feature that may be associated with the subdivision identification
sign are not regulated as part of the sign height.
6. The projection of a sign is measured by the distance by which a sign extends beyond the building line.
7. The required landscaped area for freestanding signs shall be computed by measuring the inside of the landscaped area, excluding any part
of the support structure. (Ord. 13-1546, 3-5-2013)
C. District Boundaries: Where uncertainty exists about the location of any district boundary shown on the official zoning map, the following rules
shall be used to resolve the uncertainty:
1. Where a district boundary approximately follows a property line, such property line shall be construed as the district boundary.
2. Where a district boundary approximately follows a street, alley, or railroad line, such street, alley, centerline, or the extension of such line
shall be construed as the district boundary.
3. Where a district boundary approximately follows a watercourse, the centerline of the watercourse shall be construed to be such boundary. In
the event of a change in the watercourse shoreline, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline.
4. Where a district boundary does not obviously coincide with any of the above lines (property; street, alley, or railroad line; watercourse), or
where it is not designated by dimensions, it shall be deemed to be located along the nearest section, quarter section, or sixteenth section
line.

The purpose of the traditional neighborhood districts is to encourage mixed use, compact development that is sensitive to the environmental
characteristics of the land and facilitates the efficient use of services. Vertically integrated residential projects are encouraged in all traditional
neighborhood districts. A traditional neighborhood district diversifies and integrates land uses within close proximity to each other, and it provides
for the daily recreational and shopping needs of the residents.
A. Old Town District (O-T): The purpose of the O-T District is to accommodate and encourage further intensification of the historical City center in
accord with the Meridian Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the O-T District is to delineate a centralized activity center and to encourage its
renewal, revitalization and growth as the public, quasi-public, cultural, financial and recreational center of the City. Public and quasi-public uses
integrated with general business, and medium high to high density residential is encouraged to provide the appropriate mix and intensity of
activities necessary to establish a truly urban City center.
B. Traditional Neighborhood Center District (TN-C): The purpose of the TN-C District is to serve as the focal point of a neighborhood center,
containing retail, commercial, and community services to meet the daily needs of community residents within a one to two (2) mile radius. A
TN-C is pedestrian oriented, and it is designed to encourage pedestrian connection with a Traditional Neighborhood Residential District. TN-C
District uses include small scale retail, restaurants, recreational, personal services, public or quasi-public uses, churches, and attached and
multi-family dwellings. (Ord. 05-1170, 8-30-2005, eff. 9-15-2005)
C. Traditional Neighborhood Residential District (TN-R): The purpose of the TN-R District is to provide for a variety of residential land uses
including attached and detached single-family residential, duplex, townhouse, and multi-family. A TN-R District includes open spaces and
promotes pedestrian activity through well designed and varied streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular
traffic. Most dwelling units should be accessed from alleys. The minimum density is six (6) units per acre. Density should decrease away from
the center and closer to conventional residential districts. The TN-R District should be generally located adjacent to a TN-C District, along a
transit corridor, or within a mixed use neighborhood. For the purposes of this title, the term residential district shall also include the Traditional
Neighborhood Residential District. (Ord. 16-1717, 1-3-2017)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 308/415
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to limit the tiling and piping of natural waterways, ditches, canals, laterals and drains where public safety
is not a concern as well as improve, protect and incorporate creek corridors (Five Mile, Eight Mile, Nine Mile, Ten Mile, South Slough and
Jackson and Evan Drains) as an amenity in all residential, commercial and industrial designs. When piping and fencing is proposed, the
following standards shall apply.
B. Piping:
1. Natural waterways intersecting, crossing, or lying within the area being developed shall remain as a natural amenity and shall not be piped
or otherwise covered. See also subsection C1 of this section.
2. Irrigation ditches, laterals, canals, and drains may be left open when used as a water amenity or linear open space. See also subsection C2
of this section.
3. Except as allowed above, all other irrigation ditches, laterals or canals, intersecting, crossing or lying within the area being developed, shall
be piped, or otherwise covered. This requirement does not apply to property with only an irrigation easement where the actual drainage
facility is located on an adjoining property.
a. The city council may waive the requirement for covering such ditch, lateral, canal, or drain, if it finds that the public purpose requiring such
will not be served and public safety can be preserved.
b. The city council may also waive this requirement for large capacity facilities.
C. Fencing:
1. Fencing along all natural waterways shall not prevent access to the waterway. In limited circumstances and in the interest of public safety,
larger open water systems may require fencing as determined by the city council, director and/or public works director.
2. Ditches, laterals, canals, and drains do not require fencing if it can be demonstrated by the applicant to the satisfaction of the director that
said ditch, lateral, canal, or drain serves as or will be improved as a part of the development, to be a water amenity. Construction drawings
and relevant calculations prepared by a qualified licensed professional registered in the state of Idaho shall be submitted to both the director
and the authorized representative of the water facility for approval.
3. Except as allowed above, all other open irrigation ditches, laterals, canals, and drains shall be fenced with an open vision fence at least six
feet (6') in height and having an 11-gauge, two inch (2") mesh or other construction, equivalent in ability to deter access to said ditch, lateral,
canal or drain, which fence shall be securely fastened at its base at all places where any part of said lands or areas being subdivided
touches either or both sides of said ditch, lateral, canal, or drain.
D. Easements: In residential districts, irrigation easements wider than ten feet (10') shall be included in a common lot that is a minimum of twenty
feet (20') wide and outside of a fenced area, unless modified by city council at a public hearing with notice to surrounding property owners.
E. Impeding Movement Of Water Prohibited: For any irrigation or drainage ditch not within the jurisdiction of an irrigation or drainage district, piping
shall not impede the movement of the amount of water crossing the property prior to development or the amount of water delivered to
downstream properties.
F. Natural Drainage Courses: All natural drainage courses shall be left undisturbed or be improved in a manner that will improve the hydraulics and
ease of maintenance of the channel. Relocation of natural swales is acceptable if the hydraulics and ease of maintenance are provided for. The
term "natural drainage course" shall not be deemed to apply to minor swales and depressions that are located entirely on the applicant's
property and which serve a relatively small area where runoff is infrequent. (Ord. 16-1717, 1-3-2017)
11-3A-7: FENCES:
The following regulations shall govern the type, location, and construction of all fences:
A. General standards:

11-3B-7: LANDSCAPE BUFFERS ALONG STREETS:
A. Purpose: The intent of these requirements is to ensure the long term and consistent maintenance of landscape buffers along streets that
improve the visual quality of the streetscape, unify diverse architecture, and carry out the comprehensive plan policies related to promoting
attractive street(s) and street beautification.
B. Applicability: Landscape buffers shall be required along streets in all locations, except for local streets adjacent to single-family residential,
duplex, and townhouse properties.
C. Standards: Standards for landscape buffers along streets shall be as follows:
1. Buffer Size: See chapter 2, "District Regulations", of this title. (Ord. 05-1170, 8-30-2005, eff. 9-15-2005)
a. Measurement:
(1) All street buffers with attached sidewalks shall be measured from the back of sidewalk. Where ACHD is anticipating future widening of
the street, the width of the buffer shall be measured from the ultimate sidewalk location as anticipated by ACHD.
(2) All street buffers with detached sidewalks shall be measured from the back of curb. Where ACHD is anticipating future widening of the
street, the width of the buffer shall be measured from the ultimate curb location as anticipated by ACHD. Detached sidewalks shall have
an average minimum separation of greater than four feet (4') to back of curb. (Ord. 07-1325, 7-10-2007)
b. Easements: Where the buffer is encumbered by easements or other restrictions, the buffer area shall include a minimum five foot (5') wide
area for planting shrubs and trees. (Ord. 05-1170, 8-30-2005, eff. 9-15-2005)

c. Width Reduction: In a development where the required street buffer width results in an otherwise unavoidable hardship to the property, a
written request for a buffer reduction may be submitted through the alternative compliance process in accord with chapter 5,
"Administration", of this title. The request shall demonstrate evidence of the hardship caused by the required street buffer and propose a
specific alternative landscape plan that meets or exceeds the intent of the required buffer. In no case shall the width be reduced to less
than ten percent (10%) of the depth of the lot, except in the Old Town district. A reduction to the buffer width shall not affect building
setbacks; all structures shall be set back from the property line a minimum of the buffer width required in the applicable zoning district.
(Ord. 10-1439, 1-12-2010, eff. 1-18-2010)
2. Buffer Location: Landscape buffers along streets shall be located at all subdivision boundaries.

b. All commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential street buffers shall be on a common lot or on a permanent dedicated buffer, maintained
by the property owner or business owners' association. (Ord. 07-1325, 7-10-2007)
c. Except where fences and walls are used as decorative landscape elements, fences and walls are permitted only on the interior edge of the
street buffer.
3. Buffer Landscaping Materials:
a. All required landscape buffers along streets shall be planted with trees and shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover.
b. The minimum density of one tree per thirty five (35) linear feet is required. If this calculation results in a fraction of five (5) or greater, round
up to an additional tree. If the calculation results in a fraction less than five (5), round the number down.
c. Large shrubs, hedges and conifers should be used sparingly and in clusters that are well integrated with the landscape design. Such
plants shall not screen or create a public safety hazard.
d. Where street trees are within a parkway, they shall be centered within the parkway planter. Where street trees are not within a parkway,
they shall be offset a minimum of five feet (5') from the edge of sidewalk.
4. Tree Spacing: For design flexibility, trees may be grouped together or spaced evenly as desired. However, trees shall be spaced no closer
than eighty percent (80%) of the average mature width of the trees, as demonstrated in the following examples:

this article. (Ord. 09-1420, 6-23-2009, eff. 6-23-2009)
2. For Internal Landscaping: Interior parking lot landscaping shall be required on any parking lot with more than twelve (12) spaces. The
following standards apply to internal landscaping:
a. Planter Size: Landscape planters shall contain a minimum of fifty (50) square feet, and the planting area shall not be less than five feet (5')
in any dimension, measured inside curbs. The only exception to the five foot (5') minimum dimension is at the tip of triangular planters
located at the end of rows of angled parking.
b. Parking Spaces: No linear grouping of parking spaces shall exceed twelve (12) in a row, without an internal planter island. The planter
island shall run the length of the parking space and may be reduced by two feet (2') to allow for improved vehicular maneuvering.
c. Parking Lot Layout: Interior landscaping shall, insofar as possible, be used to delineate and guide major traffic movement within the
parking area so as to prevent cross space driving. Interior landscape planters shall be spaced as evenly as feasible and at the ends of
rows of parking throughout the lot to consistently reduce the visual impact of long rows of parked cars. (Ord. 05-1170, 8-30-2005, eff. 9-15-
2005)
d. Trees Required: Each interior planter that serves a single row of parking spaces shall be landscaped with at least one tree and shall be
covered with low shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover. Each interior planter that serves a double row of parking spaces shall
have at least two (2) trees and shall be covered with low shrubs, lawn, or other vegetative ground cover. Trees shall be centered within the
planters. Deciduous shade trees shall be pruned to a minimum height of eight feet (8') above the adjacent parking areas. Evergreen trees
and class III trees are prohibited in interior planters. (Ord. 07-1325, 7-10-2007)
e. Design Flexibility: In parking areas where the strict application of this subsection C will seriously limit the function and circulation of the lot,
up to fifty percent (50%) of the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area to emphasize entrance corridors
or special landscape areas within the general parking area. Such required interior landscaping that is relocated shall be in addition to
perimeter landscape and right of way screening requirements. (Ord. 05-1170, 8-30-2005, eff. 9-15-2005)
11-3B-9: LANDSCAPE BUFFERS TO ADJOINING USES:

11-2B-3 and section 11-2C-3, table 11-2C-3 of this title. The landscape requirements in this section are intended to ensure that incompatible,
adjoining land uses are adequately protected and are provided an appropriate amount of land separation to conduct permitted uses without
causing adverse impact.
B. Applicability: The landscape buffer is required in the C-N, C-C, C-G, L-O, M-E, H-E, and I-L districts on any parcel sharing a contiguous lot line
with a residential land use. The landscape buffer is required in the I-H district on any property sharing a contiguous lot line with a nonindustrial
use.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=306 326/415
C. Standards:
1. Buffer Materials: The materials within the required buffer between incompatible land uses are regulated as follows:
a. Mix Of Materials: All buffer areas shall be comprised of, but not limited to, a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, lawn, or other
vegetative ground cover. Fences, walls and berms may also be incorporated into the buffer area as set forth in subsection 11-3B-7C2c of
this article.
b. Barrier Effectiveness: The required buffer area shall result in a barrier that allows trees to touch at the time of the tree maturity.
c. Buffer Wall And/Or Fence: Where existing or proposed adjacent land uses cannot be adequately buffered with plant material(s), the city
may require inclusion of a wall, fence, or other type of screen that mitigates noise and/or unsightly uses. If a wall or fence at least six feet
(6') tall is provided, the planting requirement may be reduced to a minimum of one tree per thirty five (35) linear feet, plus shrubs, lawn, or
other vegetative ground cover.
d. Chainlink Fencing: Chainlink fencing with or without slats does not qualify as a screening material. Except in the I-L and I-H districts,
chainlink or cyclone fencing is prohibited within required buffers between different land uses. Chainlink may be used beyond the required
buffer.
2. Minimum Buffer Size: The width of the buffer is determined by the district in which the property is located, unless such width is otherwise
modified by city council at a public hearing with notice to surrounding property owners. The tables of dimensional standards for each district
in accord with chapter 2, "District Regulations", of this title establish the minimum buffer size. A reduction to the buffer width shall not affect
building setbacks; all structures shall be set back from the property line a minimum of the buffer width required in the applicable zoning
district.
3. Pedestrian Access: Landscape buffers shall facilitate pedestrian access from residential development to abutting commercial districts and
vice versa.
4. Relationship To Parking Lot Perimeter Requirements: All buffers between different land uses may include any required perimeter parking lot
landscape buffers (see subsection 11-3B-8C of this article) when calculating the minimum width of the buffer. (Ord. 12-1514, 5-16-2012, eff.
